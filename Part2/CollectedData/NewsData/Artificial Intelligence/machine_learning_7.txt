The original caption reads: A vendor sold candy floss in Kabul on Tuesday, during festivities celebrating the Afghan New Year. Shah Marai is the photographer. The New York Times published a special dispatch from Afghanistan in March:  Afghan Children, Deprived of School, Tell of Their Deepest Fears . Heres how it begins: When the first day of the new school year starts in Afghanistan on Thursday, 3.7 million boys and girls wont be in attendance, because of increased violence, displacement and poverty. The total number  roughly one in three school-age Afghan children  is expected to grow this year as violence between Afghan forces and the Taliban intensifies, and Pakistan forces Afghan refugees to return home, according to Save the Children, an advocacy group.

Though both groups have tried to leaven their parochialism by adding an international award, it hasnt really changed the overall import, which may be why neither Milan nor Paris has followed suit.  By expanding its purview to include all designers everywhere, the B.F.C. will not only solve this problem, but also expand its potential donor base and guest list, London not having the same tradition of private and corporate philanthropy as, say, the United States. _________   Think you know leaven?

Credit Patrick McHonett     To complement our eighth annual Found Poem Student Contest , we have a thoughtful and detailed Reader Idea from Andrea Avery and Lance Coon , whose students have a long history of submitting some of our favorite entries, including 11 poems last year alone. Do you teach, or learn, with The New York Times? Tell us about it here . ________ Idea: Using The Learning Networks annual Found Poetry Contest as a catalyst for learning about poetry  and the art of assembling this type of poem. Teacher: Ms. Avery, a teacher and the author of the coming Sonata: A Memoir of Pain and the Piano, writes, below, about their work after she and Mr. Coon, fellow English teachers at the Phoenix Country Day School in Arizona, compared notes on how they introduce the contest and what activities they each do around it. School: Phoenix Country Day School Grade Levels: 9-12 Why we chose it: We really cant put this any better than Ms. Avery did herself: I wanted to share with you how we use this great opportunity to reinforce close reading, experimentation, peer review, self-review, revision in our English classes  and writing it out was helpful for me. We will be entering the Found Poetry Contest again this year. Our student winners are thrilled and excited to have been recognized by you. Samantha said that this contest allowed her to feel what its like to have someone like and recognize my work beyond her own local, school, family communities. _________ What Ms. Avery did and why, in her own words   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   I think the first year our students submitted found poems for the contest was 2013, when we were delighted to have three winners and one honorable mention. At that point, I was using it only in my senior elective Art of Composition; now my colleague Lance Coon and I are both using the contest in our classes  he does it with the seniors and I do it with the sophomores.  Continue reading the main story         Advertisement   Continue reading the main story       First, a caveat: Neither Lance nor I is eager to take credit for our students successes. But in the interest of a collegial exchange of ideas with other teachers, we have identified the following items. I also interviewed some of our winning students and have included their input. _________ Class culture and ongoing preparation for found poetry:  Photo        Students Breanna Price and Lindsey Cherilla and teacher Andrea Avery talk about found poems.   Credit Patrick McHonett    Both Lance and I agree that some aspects of our English curriculum over all are quite conducive to the found poetry assignment. Lance points out that our students  especially under his guidance  are adept at close reading of texts and that, throughout the year, he encourages them to look for a juicy image in a text or extract a phrase or sentence and explore its figurative potential. I agree. One of the activities I do with sophomores to encourage close reading of prose is to have students choose a passage from the novel were reading and do a word inventory. I think this lends itself directly to found poetry  and, in fact, a winning student specifically cited this activity as a help. We divide a piece of paper into six sections we call drawers or cubbies: common nouns, proper nouns, verbs, adjectives, figurative language and literal language. Then students inventory literally every word from the passage that fits into the drawer or cubby. This allows them to move past reading the passage for what happens or what it describes to start to see the patterns that are laced into the passage. (For example, lots of color words; verbs that suggest struggle, etc.) This also prepares them to write about the effect of the passage and subtextual elements and helps them get a sense of how many choices writers make to convey not only story or information, but also connotation, mood and tone. Samantha Dady (a 2016 runner-up for Her Mirror) said she used this technique once she had located news articles she was interested in, so that she could find common themes or tensions between the articles. Here is her poem , which is based on this article and this one .   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   A second aspect of ongoing class culture that prepares students for found poetry is our use of in-class journals. My students write for the first eight minutes of every class, often on a prompt, though they are always free to write whatever they want. Prompts are often stolen pieces of dialogue, or lines from poetry, or just funny words. This activity prepares students to play with language out of context and to imagine new scenarios for nuggets of words. _________ Introducing and preparing the lesson:  Photo        Sally Tepper works on a blackout version of a found poem.   Credit Patrick McHonett    After introducing the contest and its specifications, Lance and I both ask students to write found poems that dont follow the rules of the contest, as these early attempts wont be submitted. Lance encourages students to look anywhere, including using the classroom as a potential text. He points out that a student once used titles of files on his computer for a found poem! Ive had students use schoolwide email messages. During this play phase of the lesson, we encourage students to consider the idea of the twist or the tension between the found poem and its source (I find that sophomores love this idea). We talk about borrowing words from a text and creating something that disagrees with or contradicts the text. A student complaining about how boring his chemistry book was decided to steal words from it and create a product that was exciting, magical, thrilling. Several students chose words from political candidates websites to try to extract text that they could rearrange to express an opponents viewpoint. One used words from Microsofts website to write an ad for Apple. We also do, per the suggestion from the Learning Network site, blackout poems : One of our winners, Breanna Price (Black Magic), said that looking at other examples of found poetry in class and trying blackout poetry gave me a lot of inspiration for my own found poem. Here is Breannas poem , with links to the articles she used. _________ Three activity ideas for found poems: A. Skyes Stereoscope During a daily journal session in which I had handed every student a picture torn from a magazine to use as inspiration, one student had the brilliant idea to toggle back and forth between the images on each side of the magazine page, writing one sentence or phrase at a time for each picture and assembling them into a poem made up of lines drawn alternatingly from reverse images. This idea belongs to sophomore Skye Richmond, and I am totally going to try it with another group during the found poem unit, perhaps with some modification. I think of this as the Skyes Stereoscope exercise, because it reminds me of those old stereoscopes , or even View-Masters , in which multiple images merge to form a 3D image. B. BananaPoems I have a group of kids who come to my room at lunchtime on Fridays to play board games, and a favorite of ours is Bananagrams . It occurred to me that an activity I plan to do this month to introduce or practice found poems is as follows:  I will place on the work surface many snippets of language  words, phrases, etc., on small pieces of paper  including and, the, of, etc.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story    Students will be instructed to take a set number of snippets  say, 15  and begin making a poem.  From there, it follows the rules of Bananagrams (i.e., a person who gets it all to work says peel and everyone takes a new snippet to integrate; a player can dump a snippet in exchange for three more, etc.).  At the end, we will read and appreciate one anothers poems and/or offer suggestions to one another. C. Visible Listening This is an activity that I have done with students in our short story unit, but that I think prepares us well for poetry in general and found poems in particular. We listen to short stories read aloud. To encourage students to listen closely, I provide each with a piece of poster board and many markers. As we listen, students are asked to make their listening visible by pulling out words, images, etc., and/or by writing down their reactions. The result is a set of posters that, alone and in aggregate, depict what students were hearing  and allow us to trace patterns of imagery or to linger on and discuss phrases or words that students collected. Its sort of like a low-tech word cloud.  Photo        This is an example of Bellas (10th grade) Visible Listening products for the Raymond Carver story Cathedral.

Lance takes this one brilliant step further. He uses his Smart Board to display his work on his poem. So hell paste chunks of text up there and then, as kids are working on their own, he moves his around  so students can look up from their process and watch another poets process in action, in real time. I am stealing this idea next year.

We encourage our students to start with articles or topics theyre interested in, of course, and then (per Samanthas comment) start moving away from what the article is about to what good, borrowable, twistable language is in there. _________ Workshop, peer review, teacher feedback, revision:  Photo        Brennan Freret listens as Sally Tepper shares a found poem.   Credit Patrick McHonett    Lance uses his Smart Board to great effect here, too  though any regular classroom projector would do. He projects a students found poem draft on the screen and then guides the group through a peer review. One of the prompts he might use is Do the lines follow one another? He also emphasizes wringing out the poem: The group helps the poet cut anything that isnt earning its place on the page. Students point out words that could go, or lines that seem to retain too much prosiness. I use one-on-one consultations with students that follow what I call a recitation-observation-intention-revision format. When a student brings me her poem, I read it aloud to her, and then I ask, Anything you noticed as I read that? Then I continue the conversation by sharing an observation about the poem and asking the student about the intention behind it. With Samanthas poem, for example, I noticed something going on with the capitalizing of pronouns, but I didnt understand it. So I asked her to explain her intention, and then I pointed out my confusion, and then she came up with a solution. I might also make an observation like, I see many more words in Stanzas 1 and 2 and very few in Stanza 3  why did you make that choice? Some students seek out a friend to help them decide what lines can go (again, the emphasis is on help me trim things away from this, not what can I add?). I think Lance and I both tread pretty lightly on our students poems  we dont, for example, require them to turn in a draft for feedback before they submit to the contest. We dont, as a default, mark up our students poems. I think this might actually be something that is partly responsible for our high number of student winners: The work is truly theirs, and true to them. The poems arent too managed. We try to show them the habits and practices of self- and peer review and give them the space to do it. Or not.   I wanted to share with you how we use this great opportunity to reinforce close reading, experimentation, peer-review, self-review, revision in our English classes  and writing it out was helpful for me. We will be entering the Found Poetry Contest again this year. Our student winners are thrilled and excited to have been recognized by you. Samantha said that this contest allowed her to feel what its like to have someone like and recognize my work beyond her own local, school, family communities. Here is a collection of more of my students found poems . _________ Do you have an idea to share about teaching or learning with The Times? Let us know .

Participating is easy: Just find some poetry in a Times article  any Times article, published at any point in our 165-year history. To help, this year we also have a companion lesson plan by two teachers who use this contest to reinforce close reading, experimentation, peer-review, self-review and revision"  skills that are valuable across the curriclum. And, if that isnt enough, we also just published an additional 21 ways to teach poetry with The New York Times . Everything you need to know about the contest is below, with links and tips galore. But if you have any questions, please post them in the comments, and we will answer you there.

Credit European Space Agency/NASA    Q. Whats a found poem? A. A good nutshell description would be poems that are composed from words and phrases found in another text. A New York Times found poem, then, uses words and phrases taken from one or more Times articles, past or present  and since the paper has been publishing since 1851, choosing which Times article(s) to use is often the hardest part.  Continue reading the main story         Advertisement   Continue reading the main story       You can mix and combine these words and phrases into a new piece, or you might simply find some Times writing that you think is already poetic, as Alan Feuer has done with Craigslist and its Missed Connections posts . For more detail about found poetry and its history and classroom uses, we suggest an article from English Journal, Found Poems and Headline Poems. (PDF) Q.  What are the guidelines for this challenge? A.  Each poem must be 14 or fewer lines.  You may give it your own original title if you like. The title does not count as one of the lines.  Your sole source material must be Times pieces. You can use up to two articles.  The poem itself should use no more than two of your own words. The rest of the words and phrases can be mixed up any way you like, but should all come from The Times. (You may repeat words from the articles as many times as you like.)  You might choose to write in a traditional poetic form , or not.  Poems may be submitted by groups or by individuals. Only one poem per person is allowed, however.  You must be from 13 to 19 years old but can be from anywhere in the world.  You must post your poem as a comment on this page by 7 a.m. Eastern time on May 9.  At the bottom of your found-poem post, please provide us with the URL(s) of the article(s) you used.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story    Though The Learning Network often publishes excerpts from literary and historical works on our blog via our Text to Text and Poetry Pairing features, those are off limits for this contest. The Times articles they are paired with are, of course, fair game Note: Our commenting system doesnt recognize fancy spacing, so using words to create interesting shapes is, unfortunately, not an option. Q. What makes a great found poem? A. Scroll through the work of all the students who have won so far . As we note year after year , the poems that stand out always do two things well: They show a real love of, and care with, language, and they honor the Times source material in interesting and creative ways. Remember that in a poem, every word, line break and mark of punctuation carries meaning, so have fun experimenting with repetition of words, alliteration, assonance or anything else that enhances what you would like to say. This related lesson plan , written by two teachers whose students regularly submit to our contest and win, might also help. Finally, here is an interactive tool you might use to play with the words of your poem before you submit it: ReadWriteThinks Word Mover.  Photo        An image of The New York Times's obituary for famed poet Walt Whitman, which inspired this poem.    Q. How do I find a focus for my poem with the entire New York Times to choose from? A. Its true you can choose any Times piece ever published for this challenge, and one of our favorites the first year used an article from 1892. But the nine others we liked best that year chose much more recent work, and thats fine, too. Your poem can be on any topic or theme. It can be about something as broad as science in general or as specific as scientific observation of the relationship between a badger and a cow .   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   It can focus on something currently in the news , or you can use the Times archives or On This Day to write about the past. You can explore a trend youve read about in The Times, or you might simply collect words and phrases from different articles around a theme like identity, loss or joy. Q. How and when do I post my poem? A. Between today, April 5, and Tuesday, May 9 by 7 a.m. Eastern time , post your poem as a comment on this post. Q. How do I participate if I dont have a digital subscription to NYTimes.com? A. The Timess digital subscription system gives readers free access to 10 articles each month. If you exceed that limit, you will be asked to become a digital subscriber. One thing you should know, however, is that The Learning Network and all its posts for students, as well as all Times articles linked from them, are accessible without a digital subscription. That means that if you use any of the articles we have linked to here  with the exception of our lesson plans for teachers  they will not count as part of the 10-article limit. In addition, keep in mind that you need only one great Times article to create a great found poem.

Related Article | Related Student Poem   Credit Lynsey Addario for The New York Times    Q. Im not an English teacher. Can this exercise help me address the standards in my subject area? A. Yes! The process of creating a found poem entails closely reading sophisticated nonfiction writing in order to first identify salient words and details, then recombine those words to create something that summarizes, reacts to or comments on the topic. So, if youre studying climate change in your science classroom, for example, having students work with one or more articles from the related Times Topics page can be a creative way of having them determine central ideas or themes of a text and analyze their development and summarize the key supporting details and ideas or analyze how two or more texts address similar themes or topics.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   Creating the poem itself, by deciding what to say and how to say it, might then satisfy, say, the Common Core standard that asks that students apply knowledge of language to understand how language functions in different contexts, to make effective choices for meaning or style. Every year we get many science-themed poems, on topics from the God particle to fruit flies, the human brain to the cosmos . And judging by the many history-themed poems we receive every year, social studies teachers need little convincing that the contest can be a useful way to spur close reading of primary sources. For instance, last year a winning poet used materials from 1941 and 1945 to write verse about World War II . 2012 was the 100th anniversary of the sinking of the Titanic, and that year we received many poems that used both historic and current Times reporting on the event . And, of course, every year a majority of the work we get is current-events-focused, on topics from the Syrian refugee crisis to the Boston Marathon bombing, so participating in the contest is a way of helping your students understand news that is important to them. Here are some past lesson plans in which weve suggested found-poem exercises: Words of War: Comparing Veterans Experiences With War Poetry Hes the Bomb: Learning About the Creation and Detonation of the Atom Bomb in 1945   The Dream Continued: Creating Found Poems From Martin Luther King Jr.s New York Times Obituary Campus Catastrophe: Writing Found Poetry to Respond to the Virginia Tech Tragedy Good luck, and please post your poems and any questions you might have in the comments.

How old were they when they remembered their earliest memory? And how old were they when the remembered event took place? In  Recalling Early Childhood Memories, or Not , C. Claiborne Ray writes: Q. When four of us shared memories of our very young lives, not one of us could recall events before the age of 4 or possibly 3. Is this common?  A. Yes. For adults, remembering events only after age 312 or 4 is typical, studies have found . The phenomenon was named childhood amnesia by Freud and identified late in the 19th century by the pioneering French researcher Victor Henri and his wife, Catherine.  The Henris published a questionnaire on early memories in 1895, and the results from 123 people were published in 1897. Most of the participants earliest memories came from when they were 2 to 4 years old; the average was age 3. Very few participants recalled events from the first year of life. Many subsequent studies found similar results. Students: Read the entire article, then tell us:  Do you agree with the research that suggests the formation of childrens earliest memories are linked to when they begin talking about past events with a parent? Why or why not?  Do you have any early memories? What are they? Did someone else confirm the memory, or do you have a photograph of it? How do you know it actually happened and wasnt just a dream?    How old were you when you remembered your earliest memory? And how old were you when the remembered event took place? What details do you recall? Students 13 and older are invited to comment.

Credit Benjamin Norman for The New York Times     Compare the painting pictured above, Open Casket by Dana Schutz, with the one below, The Times Thay Aint a Changing Fast Enough! by Henry Taylor. Describe what you see. How is the subject matter depicted  is it realistic, surreal, abstract? Which of these paintings do you find more graphic? Why? Can you think of any artwork that has been banned, including books, paintings, music, movies or television? What was banned, and why?  Photo        Henry Taylors The Times Thay Aint a Changing Fast Enough!, part of the Whitney Biennial.   Credit Philip Greenberg for The New York Times    In  Should Art That Infuriates Be Removed? , Roberta Smith writes: We all encounter art we dont like, that upsets and infuriates us. This doesnt deserve to be exhibited, our brains yell; it should not be allowed to exist. Still, does such aversion mean that an artwork must be removed from view  or, worse, destroyed?  This question has been at the heart of the controversy that has split the art world since the Whitney Biennial opened nearly two weeks ago. The turmoil, which has been excruciating for many people in different ways, centers on Open Casket, a painting in the exhibition by Dana Schutz. The work is based partly on photographs of the horrifically mutilated face of Emmett Till lying in his coffin in 1955, about 10 days after that African-American 14-year-old was brutally killed by two white men in Mississippi for supposedly flirting with a white store clerk. The artist, Ms. Schutz, is white, and her use of the images has struck many in the art world as an inappropriate appropriation that, they argue, should be removed.  The first protest was solo: The day the exhibition opened an African-American artist, Parker Bright, stood in front of it wearing a T-shirt with Black Death Spectacle handwritten on its back, sometimes partly blocking the view, sometimes engaging others in conversation. A photograph of Mr. Bright at the Whitney was posted on Twitter:  Objections to the painting went viral with an open letter from Hannah Black, a British-born writer and artist who lives in Berlin, co-signed by others, charging that the Till image was black subject matter, off limits to a white artist. Ms. Black belittled the Schutz painting as exploiting black suffering for profit and fun and demanded that it be not only removed from the exhibition but also destroyed. Students: Read the entire article, then tell us:  Are there any topics or subjects that should be out of bounds for an artist? Why or why not?  Does an artists race, ethnicity, religion or gender matter when she or he creates art about a subject about a different identity group? Consider examples from the article and others not mentioned.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story    Ms. Smith writes in the article, But perhaps the most important, the paintings by Mr. Taylor and Ms. Schultz share an all-too-American subject, that of hateful, corrosive white racism. Who owns that? What do you think?

How should Americans reckon with and understand this history? Does any group own this history? Which group, or neither, and why?   The warm-up activity and the questions above came from Brian Hussey, an AP U.S. history and American studies facilitator at New Tech High @ Coppell , in Coppell, Texas. Mr. Hussey wrote to us at The Learning Network to say he has used the site frequently, in both his current school and previously, at a charter school in North Philadelphia. His students recently used this New York Times article to discuss ownership of history in their six-week Civil Rights Movement unit. Students 13 and older are invited to comment.

Do you ever worry youll let people down? Have you ever felt pressured by them when it comes to making big decisions, such as where to go to college, what to study, what jobs you should pursue, and so on? In the On Campus column  Finding Growth at My Historically Black College , Skylar Mitchell, a sophomore at Spelman College, writes: I wasnt interested in Spelman when I first visited. I was in the eighth grade and my heart was set on the Northeast Ivies. I knew I wanted extensive study-abroad options, a core curriculum and at least a 10 percent black student population. That last item was nonnegotiable.  That year during spring break, my mom took my brother and me to Atlanta to sightsee. Your nana would want you to see this school, my mom said as we pulled up to Spelmans gate. You dont have to go, but you are going to see it.  My parents shared premium on education bonded them as graduate students at the University of Southern California in the 1990s. Two New Yorkers pursuing their masters and doctorates, they saw school as the surest way to attain security. It was never a question that I was going to college. Hard work, I was taught, would ensure as many choices as possible.  That level of pressure was the norm in Montgomery County, Md., just outside Washington, D.C., where I grew up. It is one of the wealthiest and best-educated counties in the country. It is also largely segregated and fiercely competitive. I grew up surrounded by so much privilege it was possible for many residents to ignore race and class inequality entirely. After all, the nations first black president lived 12 miles away. So, despite the racial violence that was making headlines, my friends seemed to believe Montgomery County was post-racial. Students: Read the entire column, then tell us:  To what degree, if at all, do you identify with Ms. Mitchells experience of her college search or the influence other people have had on important decisions she has made?  Do you feel pressure to achieve? If so, is it you trying to attain certain things? Or does it come from family, peers, teachers, your community or others? Explain.  Do you have expectations placed on you because of what your parents, siblings or extended family members have achieved in their own lives? If so, how have you responded to those expectations?    In her writing, Ms. Mitchell talks about how her peers reacted when she told them she would attend Spelman. What do you think about that? Have you ever been on the receiving end of judgment commentary about a decision you made? How did you deal with it? Students 13 and older are invited to comment. All comments are moderated by the Learning Network staff, but please keep in mind that once your comment is accepted, it will be made public.

Credit Charlie Mahoney for The New York Times     In The Beauty and Joy of Computing, the course he helped conceive for nonmajors at the University of California, Berkeley, Daniel Garcia explains an all-important concept in computer science  abstraction  in terms of milkshakes. There is a reason when you go to the Joy of Cooking and you want to make a strawberry milkshake, you dont look under strawberry milkshake,  he said. Rather, there is a recipe for milkshakes that instructs you to add ice cream, milk and fruit of your choice. While earlier cookbooks may have had separate recipes for strawberry milkshakes, raspberry milkshakes and boysenberry milkshakes, eventually, he imagines, someone said, Why dont we collapse that into one milkshake recipe? The idea of abstraction, he said, is to hide the details. It requires recognizing patterns and distilling complexity into a precise, clear summary. Its like the countdown to a space launch that runs through a checklist  life support, fuel, payload  in which each check represents perhaps 100 checks that have been performed. Concealing layers of information makes it possible to get at the intersections of things, improving aspects of a complicated system without understanding and grappling with each part. Abstraction allows advances without redesigning from scratch.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   It is a cool and useful idea that, along with other cool and useful computer science ideas, has people itching to know more. Its obvious that computers have become indispensable problem-solving partners, not to mention personal companions. But its suddenly not enough to be a fluent user of software interfaces. Understanding what lies behind the computers seeming magic now seems crucial. In particular, computational thinking is captivating educators, from kindergarten teachers to college professors, offering a new language and orientation to tackle problems in other areas of life.  Continue reading the main story         Advertisement   Continue reading the main story       This promise  as well as a job market hungry for coding  has fed enrollments in classes like the one at Berkeley, taken by 500 students a year. Since 2011, the number of computer science majors has more than doubled, according to the Computing Research Association . At Stanford, Princeton and Tufts, computer science is now the most popular major. More striking, though, is the appeal among nonmajors. Between 2005 and 2015, enrollment of nonmajors in introductory, mid- and upper-level computer science courses grew by 177 percent, 251 percent and 143 percent, respectively. In the fall, the College Board introduced a new Advanced Placement course, Computer Science Principles, focused not on learning to code but on using code to solve problems. And WGBH, the PBS station in Boston, is using National Science Foundation money to help develop a program for 3- to 5-year-olds in which four cartoon monkeys get into scrapes and then get out of the messes by applying computational thinking, said Marisa Wolsky, executive producer of childrens media. We see it as a groundbreaking curriculum that is not being done yet. Computational thinking is not new. Seymour Papert , a pioneer in artificial intelligence and an M.I.T. professor, used the term in 1980 to envision how children could use computers to learn. But Jeannette M. Wing, in charge of basic research at Microsoft and former professor at Carnegie Mellon, gets credit for making it fashionable. In 2006, on the heels of the dot-com bust and plunging computer science enrollments, Dr. Wing wrote a trade journal piece , Computational Thinking. It was intended as a salve for a struggling field. Things were so bad that some universities were thinking of closing down computer science departments, she recalled. Some now consider her article a manifesto for embracing a computing mind-set. Like any big idea, there is disagreement about computational thinking  its broad usefulness as well as what fits in the circle. Skills typically include recognizing patterns and sequences, creating algorithms, devising tests for finding and fixing errors, reducing the general to the precise and expanding the precise to the general. It requires reframing research, said Shriram Krishnamurthi, a computer science professor at Brown, so that instead of formulating a question to a human being, I formulate a question to a data set. For example, instead of asking if the media is biased toward liberals, pose the question as: Are liberals identified as liberal in major newspapers more often or less often than conservatives are identified as conservative? Dr. Krishnamurthi helped create Introduction to Computation for the Humanities and Social Sciences more than a decade ago because he wanted students early in their undergrad careers to learn a new mode of thinking that they could take back to their discipline. Capped at 20 students, the course now has a waitlist of more than 100.

And not just for work. Applying computational thinking, we can improve the efficiencies of our daily lives, she said in an interview, and make ourselves a little less stressed out.  Photo        In his computer science course for nonmajors at the University of California, Berkeley, Dan Garcia wants students to understand why computers are not magical. In this exercise, students sort a deck of shuffled cards into ordered suits while being timed. They sort solo, then in pairs, then fours, then eights. But more people dont always make it go faster. Amdahls law offers an equation to show that even with many computers tackling a problem, the time to complete the task does not decrease linearly. There are bottlenecks.   Credit Jim Wilson/The New York Times    Computing practices like reformulating tough problems into ones we know how to solve, seeing trade-offs between time and space, and pipelining (allowing the next action in line to begin before the first completes the sequence) have many applications, she said. Consider the buffet line. When you go to a lunch buffet, you see the forks and knives are the first station, she said. I find that very annoying. They should be last. You shouldnt have to balance your plate while you have your fork and knife. Dr. Wing, who equates a child filling her backpack to caching (how computers retrieve and store information needed later), sees the buffets inefficiency as a failure to apply logical thinking and sequencing. Computational thinking, she said, can aid a basic task like planning a trip  breaking it into booking flights, hotels, car rental  or be used for something as complicated as health care or policy decision-making. Identifying subproblems and describing their relationship to the larger problem allows for targeted work. Once you have well-defined interfaces, she said, you can ignore the complexity of the rest of the problem. Can computational thinking make us better at work and life? Dr. Krishnamurthi is sometimes seduced. Before I go grocery shopping, I sort my list by aisles in the store, he said. Sharing the list on the app Trello, his family can bucket sort items by aisle (pasta and oils, canned goods, then baking and spices), optimizing their path through Whole Foods. It limits backtracking and reduces spontaneous, i.e., junk, purchases, he said. Despite his chosen field, Dr. Krishnamurthi worries about the current cultural tendency to view computer science knowledge as supreme, better than that gained in other fields. Right now, he said, we are just overly intoxicated with computer science. It is certainly worth wondering if some applications of computational thinking are trivial, unnecessary or a Stepford Wife-like abdication of devilishly random judgment. Alexander Torres, a senior majoring in English at Stanford, has noted how the campuss proximity to Google has lured all but the rare student to computer science courses. Hes a holdout. But I dont see myself as having skills missing, he said. In earning his degree he has practiced critical thinking, problem solving, analysis and making logical arguments. When you are analyzing a Dickinson or Whitman or Melville, you have to unpack that language and synthesize it back.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   There is no reliable research showing that computing makes one more creative or more able to problem-solve. It wont make you better at something unless that something is explicitly taught, said Mark Guzdial, a professor in the School of Interactive Computing at Georgia Tech who studies computing in education. You cant prove a negative, he said, but in decades of research no one has found that skills automatically transfer. Still, he added, for the same reasons people should understand biology, chemistry or physics, it makes a lot of sense to understand computing in our lives. Increasing numbers of people must program in their jobs, even if its just Microsoft Excel. Solving problems with computers happens to all of us every day, he said. How to make the skills available broadly is an interesting challenge.  Its like being a diplomat and learning Spanish; I feel like its essential, said Greer Brigham, a Brown freshman who plans to major in political science. Hes taking the course designed by Dr. Krishnamurthi, which this term is being taught by a graduate student in robotics named Stephen Brawner. On a March morning at the Brown computer science center, Mr. Brawner projected a students homework assignment on the screen. Did anyone notice a problem? Nary a humanities hand was raised. Finally, a young woman suggested centimeters and kilograms could be abbreviated. Fine, but not enough. Mr. Brawner broke the silence and pointed out long lines of code reaching the far side of the screen. With a practiced flurry, he inserted backslashes and hit return repeatedly, which drew the symbols into a neat block. It may all be directions to a machine, but computer scientists care a great deal about visual elegance. As Mr. Brawner cut out repeated instructions, he shared that whenever we define a constant, we want that at the top of our code. He then explained the new assignment: write a program to play rock, paper, scissors against a computer. Mili Mitra, a junior majoring in public policy and economics who sat with a MacBook on her lap, would not have considered this class a year ago. But seeing group research projects always being handed off to someone with computing knowledge, she decided that she didnt want to keep passing them along. She has learned to write basic code and fetch data sets through the internet to analyze things shes interested in, such as how geographic proximity shapes voting patterns in the United Nations General Assembly. Despite finding interactions with a computer much like explaining things to a toddler, Ms. Mitra credits the class for instilling the habit of going step by step and building a solution. She admits to being an impatient learner: I jump ahead. In C.S. you dont have a choice. If you miss a step, you mess up everything.

OPEN Interactive Feature      Just as children are drilled on the scientific method  turn observations into a hypothesis, design a control group, do an experiment to test your theory  the basics of working with computers is being cast as a teachable blueprint. One thing making this possible is that communicating with computers has become easier.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   Block programming languages like Scratch, released by the M.I.T. Media Lab a decade ago, hide text strings that look like computer keys run amok. That makes coding look less scary. Instead of keyboard letters and symbols, you might select from a menu and drag a color-coded block that says say ( ) for ( ) secs or play note ( ) for ( ) beats. The colors and shapes correspond to categories like sound or motion; the blocks can be fit together like stacked puzzle pieces to order instructions. Students use this to, say, design a game. One need not be a digital Dr. Doolittle, fluent in hard-core programming languages like Java or Python, to code. Block languages cut out the need to memorize commands, which vary depending on the computer language, because the block is read just the way you think about it, Dr. Garcia said. Students in his Berkeley course use the block language Snap! for assignments  he doesnt teach Python until the last two weeks, and then just so they can take higher-level courses. We tell them, You already know how to program,  he said, because the steps are the same. Computer Science A, which teaches Java, is the fastest-growing Advanced Placement course. (The number of students taking the exam in 2016 rose 18 percent over 2015 and nearly tripled in a decade.) But professors complained that Java was not the right way to attract a diverse group of students, said Trevor Packer, head of the A.P. program, so a new course was developed. The course, Computer Science Principles, is modeled on college versions for nonmajors. It lets teachers pick any coding language and has a gentler vibe. There is an exam, but students also submit projects more similar to a studio art portfolio, Mr. Packer said. The course covers working with data and understanding the internet and cyber security, and it teaches transferable skills, he said, like formulating precise questions. Thats a departure from what the College Board found in many high schools: They were learning how to keyboard, how to use Microsoft applications. The goal is that the new course will be offered in every high school in the country. President Obamas Computer Science for All initiative, officially launched last year, resulted in educators, lawmakers and computer science advocates spreading the gospel of coding. It also nudged more states to count computer science toward high school graduation requirements. Thirty-two states and the District of Columbia now do, up from 12 in 2013, according to Code.org . Its what Dr. Wing had hoped for when she advocated in her 2006 article that, along with reading, writing and arithmetic we should add computational thinking to every childs analytical ability.   Photo        After arranging blocks into a sequence of commands, kindergartners at the Eliot-Pearson Childrens School scanned the bar codes on the blocks into their yellow robot. It obeyed their commands.   Credit Charlie Mahoney for The New York Times    In an airy kindergarten classroom at Eliot-Pearson Childrens School, in the Tufts University Department of Child Study and Human Development, children program with actual blocks. Marina Umaschi Bers, a child development and computer science professor, created wooden blocks that bear bar codes with instructions such as forward, spin and shake that are used to program robots  small, wheeled carts with built-in scanners  by sequencing the blocks, then scanning them. Each program starts with a green begin block and finishes with a red end. Coding for the youngest students has become the trendy pedagogy, with plentiful toys and apps like Dr. Berss blocks. Dr. Bers, who with M.I.T. collaborators developed the block language ScratchJr, is evangelical about coding. Learning the language of machines, she said, is as basic as writing is to being proficient in a foreign language. You are able to write a love poem, you are able to write a birthday card, you are able to use language in many expressive ways, she said. You are not just reading; you are producing. Peer-reviewed studies by Dr. Bers show that after programming the robots, youngsters are better at sequencing picture stories. Anecdotally, she said, when they ask children to list steps for brushing teeth, they get just a few, but after being exposed to this work, theyll have 15 or 20 steps.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   Dr. Bers embeds computing in activities familiar to young children like inventing stories, doing dances and making art. At the Tufts school on a recent morning, children puzzled over a question: How does a robot celebrate spring? Hes going to dance, and then he will pretend that he is wet, offered Hallel Cohen-Goldberg, a kindergartner with a mane of curls. Solina Gonzalez, coloring a brown, blue and red circle with markers, peered soberly through pink-framed glasses: He just does a lollipop dance. Solinas partner, Oisin Stephens, fretted about the root beer lollipop drawing she had taped to a block. The robot wont be able to read this, he said. (Its an invalid input.) As they lurched around the carpet on their knees, the children executed computer science concepts like breaking instructions into sequenced commands, testing and debugging. One team used repeat and stop repeat blocks, forming a programming loop, a sequence of instructions that is continually repeated until a certain condition is reached.   It may be a leap to think of talking to machines as childs play. But when Dr. Bers chats with students as they sequence blocks, they hardly notice they are coding. They say, Well, Im not programming,  she said. Consciously or not, this next generation may be effortlessly absorbing the computational thinking skills so many covet, and in the process refining what we mean by digital native.
