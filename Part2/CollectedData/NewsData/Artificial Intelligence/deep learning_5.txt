The original caption reads: Dec. 16, 1960: The remains of a mid-air collision of two planes over New York City wreaked death and chaos on the corner of Sterling Place and Seventh Avenue in Brooklyn, where a United Airlines flight from Chicago fell. The other plane, a Trans World Airlines flight from Ohio, fell on Staten Island. One 11-year-old boy survived , only to perish the next day . The death toll, 134, was the highest in United States aviation history at the time. Allyn Baum was the photographer.

Marnie copes with this separation in her usual fashion, calling Lori amid visits to the mall (cue the Crate & Barrel product placements) and visits to Loris dogs, Loris friends and Loris shrink. Marnie has started to see the therapist (Amy Landecker in a quick, deadpan turn) at Loris urging, though mostly she seems to go as a way to insinuate herself even more deeply into her daughters life. Its no wonder that Marnie seems like a smother-mother whos one 911 call away from a restraining order; no wonder too that she seems lonely. _________   Think you know insinuate?

The idea below explains how Joni-Jean Crivello helped foster a love of the print edition of The New York Times in students looking to connect current events to history, or just find the crossword puzzle. Do you teach, or learn, with The New York Times? Tell us about it here. _________ Idea: Use the print edition of The New York Times as a teaching tool for the social studies classroom  and as a reward Teacher: Joni-Jean Crivello Institution:  Medford Memorial Middle School , Medford, N.J. Grade Level: Middle school Why We Chose It: We admire Ms. Crivellos enthusiastic approach to bringing current events and a love of daily nonfiction reading into the social studies classroom.  Continue reading the main story         Advertisement   Continue reading the main story       _________ What Ms. Crivello Did and Why, in Her Own Words I use The New York Times almost daily as a teaching tool with my eighth-grade American history students. Connections exist consistently, whether we are analyzing American indigenous people , colonization or occupation in places like Zimbabwe , events leading to revolution, the idea of democracy , the assimilation of immigrants into American culture, the role of African Americans and women in society, civil unrest or civil war. Many adolescents will be old enough to vote in the 2020 presidential election, a compelling reason to incorporate the latest political news. As for issues, just about any article about the 2016 presidential campaign touched on separation of powers, protected speech, undue influence, gender issues, and the election process in general, to name just a few connections for students. Likewise, ISIL activities spawn discussions about fomenting rebellion and the Establishment Clause of the U.S. Constitution . Events in Baton Rouge or St. Paul have led to conversations about the fundamental right of privacy, the legacy of Reconstruction efforts, the challenges of assimilating cultures, and principles of nationalism and federalism. The Timess coverage of  Hamilton  alone is a frequent reference for both its civics content and cultural value. Middle schoolers appreciate being treated like adults by the simple act of sharing The New York Times and the multitude of discussions which always ensue. Our mission as educators is to instill a love of learning, cultivate open minds, and foster reflection of critical life events from multiple points of view. The Times offers dozens of assists in that regard every day. These young citizens care deeply for their world, but that is not possible without being included in the conversation. In addition, the Opinion page is a launching pad for persuasive and argumentative writing tasks. By including the news and editorial opinions in class periods and drawing connections with historical events, I do full lessons on the structure and general content of a newspaper. Utilizing The Times as a history teacher affords me an invaluable opportunity to stimulate the minds of our future leaders, entrepreneurs, service industry workers and journalists.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   A Suggested Activity Flip through the pages in front of your class sharing only the headlines, or a photograph or the topic of the days lead editorial. You will discover that becoming a newshound is part of our nature as curious beings. In short order, the student will turn the pages without provocation. Incorporate todays headlines and news. For example, to emphasize that the governments primary role is to keep its citizens safe, I will share parts of the Magazine article  America Is Safer Than It Used to Be. So Why Do We Still Have Calls for Law and Order?  Beyond the News Use The Times and be rewarded by students who interrupt the beginning of a daily lesson to inquire about what is in the news. Experience a teaching aha! moment when students run to you first thing in the morning to discuss an event about which they are aware. Relish in the fun of trying to solve the Final Jeopardy question and the daily crossword  talk about building knowledge and vocabulary, not to mention strategy. Most days I can barely enter my classroom without students grabbing The Times from my briefcase so they can have first crack at the crossword and Final Jeopardy. Typically, they give me my paper to hold onto until the end of the day so they could complete the puzzle or bring it home after dismissal. On the final day of school, I purchased copies of The Times for some of these students. They acted as if Santa had fulfilled their Christmas lists! A few days later, one of their moms wrote an email message to express her gratitude; she said she had experienced her first nirvana moment as a mother. On the previous day, her daughter asked her to buy a Sunday New York Times so she can read it and do the crossword puzzle. At 13! All the challenges I had experienced as a public educator in recent years melted away upon reading that one email. _________ Related   NYTimes Student Video  Video by Sarah Gross   A few years ago, two teachers from New Jersey, Sarah Gross and Jonathan Olsen, team-taught a humanities classes at High Technology High School where they began each day by reading The New York Times.

If so, in what areas of your life do you tend to compete? Are you more competitive when it comes to beating your own expectations of yourself, transcending a past record of your ownor outperforming another person? Why do you think that is? In the Gray Matter Opinion column  Women Do Like to Compete  Against Themselves , Coren Apicella and Johanna Mollerstrom write: Years of research suggest that men are more competitive than women. Imagine there is a task you must complete  a series of math problems, for instance  and you have to choose to be paid for your performance in one of two ways. One option is to be compensated for each individual math problem you solve (say, $1 per problem). The other option is that you enter a tournament in which you compete against another person; only the person who solves the most problems receives payment for the number of problems solved  but its double payment ($2 per problem). Even when men and women perform similarly on the task, studies show, women are less likely to choose to enter the tournament.  ... Competitions are a great motivational tool for increasing performance. This is one of the main reasons institutions often encourage competitive pressure. Our study also examined whether people improved their performance in the arithmetic task more between the first two rounds when Round 2 involved a competition against others versus self. It turns out that men and women who competed against themselves improved their score just as much as those who competed against another person. Thus our study suggests that competition against yourself is equally effective in improving performance. Students: Read the entire column, then tell us:  Does your own experience support or contradict the writers claims about competition between males and females? Explain.  Do you agree with their studys finding that competition against yourself is equally effective [as competing against another person] in improving performance? Why or why not?

Continue reading the main story         Advertisement   Continue reading the main story        Do you ever try to make yourself more competitive against other people or yourself? Or, conversely, have you tried not to be competitive?    What are the best lessons youve learned about competition, whether you see yourself as competitive or you dont? Explain.

Student Opinion   By   CAROLINE CROSSON GILPIN    FEB. 24, 2017      Continue reading the main story  Share This Page   Continue reading the main story              Photo         Credit Hayden Maynard     Facebook, Twitter and other social media sites have become an integral part of teenage culture. Yet the snarky comment or inappropriate picture we share with our friends just might not project the image we want the rest of the world to see, especially as we get older. How careful are you online? In this Preoccupations column , Cal Newport argues that social media can hurt your career: As you become more valuable to the marketplace, good things will find you. To be clear, Im not arguing that new opportunities and connections are unimportant. Im instead arguing that you dont need social medias help to attract them.  My second objection concerns the idea that social media is harmless. Consider that the ability to concentrate without distraction on hard tasks is becoming increasingly valuable in an increasingly complicated economy. Social media weakens this skill because its engineered to be addictive. The more you use social media in the way its designed to be used  persistently throughout your waking hours  the more your brain learns to crave a quick hit of stimulus at the slightest hint of boredom.  Once this Pavlovian connection is solidified, it becomes hard to give difficult tasks the unbroken concentration they require, and your brain simply wont tolerate such a long period without a fix. Indeed, part of my own rejection of social media comes from this fear that these services will diminish my ability to concentrate  the skill on which I make my living.  The idea of purposefully introducing into my life a service designed to fragment my attention is as scary to me as the idea of smoking would be to an endurance athlete, and it should be to you if youre serious about creating things that matter. In contrast, Patrick Gillooly argues in this column that your social media presence can be as important as your resume. Most employers and customers Ive talked to are ultimately looking for confirmation of their excitement about you, not reasons for suspicions or doubts. Not having any profile could be seen as a red flag, so why give a potential employer any reason to question your candidacy?  Your social media presence  and, really, your whole digital footprint  is no longer just an extension of your resume. Its as important as your resume. Social media use is now a standard of the hiring process, and theres little chance of going back.  You need to realize that social media wields great power: What you say there  including saying nothing at all  has an effect on your network or on the employer who is checking out your Instagram account. But remember that you control what people see. By being more judicious about what you share or by altering the platform settings where possible, you can manage your digital trail to increase the odds that a potential employer will form a positive impression of you. Students: Read both articles, then tell us:  Do you think social media will help or hurt your college and career goals? Why?  Was either columnist more persuasive, in your opinion? Which one, and why?  Did you have a strong opinion about the value of social media to a persons professional life before you read the articles? Regardless of your stand either way, did reading the columns sway you to one side or the other? Why or why not?    Conduct a personal social media audit. Make a list of your social media accounts, including old platforms you no longer use. How do think admissions officers or employers might view your social media presence on those accounts.

President Xi Jinping of China is said to have low regard for Mr. Kim, who has not visited China and is not known to have been invited.

Beijing held its tongue, even as its neighbor engaged in saber rattling, nuclear testing and bombastic threats. But by this week, things may have gone too far, with North Korea unleashing a tirade in which it deployed some of the most damning insults in its playbook, accusing China of dancing to the tune of the U.S. and styling itself as a big power. Chinese observers of relations between the countries were left in disbelief about how rapidly those ties have deteriorated, particularly after Beijing decided to cut off coal imports that provide badly needed currency for the Norths economy. At first many people thought it was a fake commentary, Cheng Xiaohe, associate professor of international studies at Renmin University, said of the tirade against China, published in the Norths state-run news media on Thursday. It is a big surprise that North Korea has launched such a strong attack against China. I expected an angry reaction  but not this strong.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   The diatribe, carried by the Korean Central News Agency, came just before the Malaysian government announced that VX nerve agent had killed Kim Jong-nam, the half brother of the Norths leader, Kim Jong-un . North Korean agents are suspected of masterminding the attack .  Photo        A silk mill in Pyongyang this week. North Korea has a cash-starved economy that could suffer from Beijings decision to cut off coal imports.   Credit Ed Jones/Agence France-Presse  Getty Images    The disclosure that a chemical weapon banned under international treaties was used in the attack is sure to put more pressure on Chinas relations with North Korea, which some Chinese analysts say are at their lowest point since the founding of the North as a separate country after World War II.  Continue reading the main story         Advertisement   Continue reading the main story       The disclosure makes things worse, Mr. Cheng said. Its wrong to kill the half brother. Its more wrong to have used banned chemical agents. Earlier this month, the North issued a more indirect takedown of Beijing in its government newspaper Minju Joson, signaling a growing rift. Shortly afterward, China announced the suspension of coal imports. The burst of criticisms from Pyongyang  coupled with Beijings coal ban  suggested boiling tensions between Chinas president, Xi Jinping , 63, who sees himself as a global leader, and Mr. Kim, 33, an eccentric dictator. Mr. Xi is said to have low regard for Mr. Kim, who has not visited China and is not known to have been invited. Despite past periods of turbulence, including under Mao Zedong, both sides have more or less tried to preserve a polite public veneer of amity. But the friendship was a myth, said Shen Zhihua, a professor of history at East China Normal University.  Photo        The view from the landmark Juche Tower in Pyongyang last week. The rift between China and North Korea has emerged as the United States has pushed for Beijing to do more to curb Pyongyangs nuclear ambitions.   Credit Ed Jones/Agence France-Presse  Getty Images    The Chinese government has always viewed North Korea as a vassal country, he said in an interview with Phoenix Television on Thursday, shortly before the North Korean editorial was published.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   You can go through the Peoples Daily from 1949 to this day, we have never said a single word of ill, all words of praise, about North Korea, said Mr. Shen, who is one of Chinas pre-eminent historians on the North. Meanwhile, the North Korean newspapers do not speak ill of China. Even as the relationship has noticeably worsened in recent weeks, China has maintained public restraint. An editorial in Global Times, a state-run tabloid that sometimes reflects the thinking of senior government officials, noted on Friday that the suspension of coal imports was fair and in keeping with United Nations sanctions.

China and North Korea are friendly neighbors, and we are willing to work with the North Korean side in joint efforts to develop healthy and stable relations, said Geng Shuang, the ministry spokesman. The ministry also played down the significance of the Malaysian announcement that VX had been used in the killing of Kim Jong-nam. It is only a preliminary result published by Malaysia, and there is not conclusion on this yet, Mr. Geng said.  Photo        A coal-powered power station in Pyongyang. China said it was ending imports of North Korean coal because it had already met the quota permitted under United Nations sanctions.   Credit Ed Jones/Agence France-Presse  Getty Images    It was not immediately clear how much Chinas ban on coal imports would affect North Koreas ability to look after its population. And at least publicly, China said that it was imposing the ban only because it had already fulfilled its coal quota allowed under United Nations sanctions. That seemed to suggest that Beijing may have already paid Pyongyang for the coal it imported in the first 50 days of this year, money that would go to the Norths cash-starved government, experts said. The exposure of the deepening rift comes as the Trump administration has been pressuring Beijing to use its leverage to curtail the Norths rapidly expanding nuclear weapons program . In the last week, the American secretary of state, Rex Tillerson, has spoken with Chinas senior foreign policy official, Yang Jiechi, and the Chinese foreign minister, Wang Yi, about North Korea.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   President Trump has said China can do significantly more to persuade the North to scale back its nuclear program, even as Beijing has told Washington that it holds limited influence. The latest flare-up is likely to further weaken that leverage, while illustrating the resistance of Kim Jong-un to Chinas arguments in favor of a denuclearized Korean Peninsula. In terms of diplomacy, I see no solution, said Yan Xuetong, the director of the Institute of International Studies at Tsinghua University. Mr. Yan, writing in the Chinese news media this week, said that China had no choice but to accept the North as a nuclear-armed state. That was because China had only two options: either a nuclear North Korea that was friendly toward China or a nuclear North Korea that was unfriendly, he wrote. I am very pessimistic about this issue, Mr. Yan said.   Follow Jane Perlez on Twitter @JanePerlez . Yufan Huang contributed research.

All of Them Image Credit Lisk Feng By  Peter Suderman Feb. 25, 2017 For years, the Academy Awards reliably recognized movies that attempted to capture the sweep of the American idea  in earnest films like Forrest Gump and Saving Private Ryan as well as more scorching efforts like There Will Be Blood  that seemed to want to define the country, and its people, all at once. If you wanted a shot at a best-picture Oscar in that era, an ambitious statement film that tried to tell Americans who they really are was a good bet. But in this decade, the Oscars have turned inward, eschewing ambitious epics and grand statements about the national character in favor of anxious self-reflection, bestowing the Academys highest honors on films like The Artist and Argo that flattered Hollywoods self-image. True, in the aftermath of the financial crisis, a handful of movies tried to channel the countrys mood (The Wolf of Wall Street and American Hustle) or critique its historic self-conception (12 Years a Slave). But by and large, Hollywood went from examining the national character to examining its own. This years crop has some of that. A top contender, La La Land, a technically proficient love letter to old Hollywood musicals, is set in Los Angeles, of course. Yet the nine films nominated for the Academys highest honor manage to present a vision not of the American identity, but of the variety of American identities  a collage of very different American lives that, taken together, provide as strong a sense of the American idea as any single movie ever has. Start with Fences, which, along with Moonlight and Hidden Figures, explores the black experience in America. Denzel Washingtons stirring adaptation of August Wilsons 1985 play about a working-class black family in Pittsburgh during the 1950s probably has the most to say about the American character. Working from some of the same elements as Death of a Salesman, it is blunt about the role of racial discrimination in postwar America. Yet it is also a small-scale affair about the struggles of family life set mostly in a tiny back yard. Hidden Figures, a true story about the contributions of black women to the space program during the 1960s, plays like a perspective-flipped version of The Right Stuff. Both Figures and Fences are steeped in a kind of counter-nostalgia that re-examines postwar America in a more critical light. No Oscar nominee this year is more intensely focused on the nuances and complexities of individual identity than Moonlight. The most likely challenger to La La Land, it follows its gay, black protagonist  first as a child, then as a teenager and finally as a hardened young adult  as he struggles with self-actualization and self-acceptance. As Juan (Mahershala Ali), the drug dealer who helps raise him, says early in the film: At some point, you got to decide for yourself who youre going to be. Cant let nobody make that decision for you. The line is the key to this years entire slate of best-picture nominees, which are built on depictions of specific people and places with cultures and cadences, and accents and aesthetics, that define the characters as separate from the rest of the country. Another set of films examine class and culture in white America. La La Land is both a throwback musical fueled by cinematic self-reference and a portrait of two urban, coastal strivers who pour themselves into their ideas and ambitions, in part because they cling to a belief in the promise of a creatively and economically fulfilling life. That makes for a striking contrast with Hell or High Water, a taut neo-Western thriller set against the economic struggles of small-town Texas, where debt is rampant and the population is dwindling. The movie follows two brothers who, in an act of economic revenge, have decided to rob the bank thats about to foreclose on their family home. Its a bleak, rural counterpoint to the colorful urban fantasia of La La Land; one tells the story of working-class men with nothing to lose, the other the story of creative professionals with everything to gain. Mel Gibsons bloody, brutal World War II drama Hacksaw Ridge also nods to classic Hollywood, with a romantic, earnest first hour. The film tells the true story of the religiously motivated conscientious objector Desmond Dosss battlefield heroism, and it stands out in this years field for its unironic portrayal of individual religious conviction. All these films embrace cultural memory of a decidedly different flavor than whats on display in Fences and Hidden Figures. In La La Land, Ryan Gosling plays Seb, a jazz fanatic obsessed with the genres decline. He takes Mia (Emma Stone) to a jazz club, where he insists: Thats why you need to be in the space and see whats at stake. This whole thing  its dying. For Seb, jazz isnt just a kind of music. Its a way of life, enacted in a particular place, but its struggling to survive  much like the dusty Texas towns of Hell or High Water. The writer-director Kenneth Lonergans Manchester By the Sea is another film defined by both a deep sense of place and a painful attachment to the past. Mr. Lonergans portrait of mumbling, emotionally detached Northeastern working-class whites forced to deal with unbearable loss is a story about a distinctly individual trauma, but also about how a communitys particular traits and habits can alter the way that loss is felt. Each of these movies, in other words, is about the struggle for individual and cultural self-definition  and the challenge of allowing for all those competing self-definitions to flourish and coexist within some larger American community. They are portraits of a nation fragmented by race, class, culture and geography. Even the two I have yet to mention  Lion and Arrival  exist on the same continuum. Lion, the only best-picture nominee to be set entirely outside the United States, is the true tale of an international adoptees search for his Indian birthplace that deals with belonging and the pull of two very different cultures. Arrival is a literary science-fiction story about translating an alien language, and in the process learning a new thought paradigm that staves off global war. Its a movie about learning to find peace in a dangerous world with others who dont speak or think like you. Which is something like the challenge that America now faces. Perhaps more than anything else, last years presidential race was fought over internal questions of national identity as well as uneasiness about Americas place in the world. The election did not resolve those questions so much as highlight the strength of disagreement. The narrow, personal focus of this years top Oscar nominees suggests how tough it may be for Americans, or Hollywood, to settle on a single unifying vision of what America means, or what it means to be an American. It may never again be possible for one movie to fully answer those questions. More likely, it never was. Yet this years best-picture crop may have provided an answer  in the notion that there is no one American story, but a variety of specific and unique American stories , and in the idea that America is a nation of both individualism and pluralism. You might think of the movies in the best-picture category as a kind of expanded cinematic universe  not of superheroes, but of ordinary, extraordinary lives, overlapping and intersecting in a sprawling national epic too big for any one film. Of course, that means the task is more difficult for moviegoers as well: If you really want to find out what America looks like, you have to watch all of them.
