Credit Ford     How do you create a map showing every road in the United States, with the precise location of every stop sign, all the lane markings, every exit ramp and every traffic light  and update it in real time as traffic is rerouted around construction and accidents? Thats a challenge that automakers and technology companies are confronting in their race to develop self-driving cars, the kind that someday will let you sit back and read or watch TV on the way to work each morning. The need for highly detailed, three-dimensional, computerized maps  which pinpoint a cars location and understand its surroundings  is often overlooked amid all the hype about autonomous vehicles. The chatter tends to focus more on the various sensors that enable cars to see the road and any obstacles in front of them. Those sensors include radar, cameras and a laser-based kind of radar known as lidar. But digital maps are an equally critical piece of the puzzle. If we want to have autonomous cars everywhere, we have to have digital maps everywhere, said Amnon Shashua, chief technology officer at Mobileye , an Israeli company that makes advanced vision systems for automobiles.

And compared with the maps used by GPS and navigation systems, the level of precision must be much greater. Navigational maps typically locate a cars position within several yards. Digital maps for autonomous cars must know the locations of cars, curbs and other objects within about four inches.  Continue reading the main story         Advertisement   Continue reading the main story       So far the drive to create digital maps has been slow. Googles former self-driving car division  now a company called Waymo  has created maps for roads around its headquarters in Mountain View, Calif., and a handful of other cities, including Austin, Tex., and Kirkland, Wash. Waymo creates the maps by driving around cars equipped with spinning lidar units mounted on their roofs that shoot out laser beams, creating images of the road and the surroundings. Human engineers, in a time-consuming process, then go over the images and tag the objects that are found, like stop signs, buildings, stoplights and do-not-enter signs. The laser equipment needed to do this scanning is expensive  it can cost $100,000 or more to outfit just one car to do this job.            5 Things That Give Self-Driving Cars Headaches    Another company, Here , which was started by Nokia and then acquired by the German automakers BMW, Daimler and Audi, is also mapping roads in the United States and Europe. It is drawing on data scooped up by scanning systems that trucking companies have agreed to install on their vehicles. Here also has its own fleet of cars collecting images, and is working on algorithms to enable computers to annotate the maps. The effort may soon shift into higher gear, thanks to an idea borrowed from the internet that has helped in other fields: crowdsourcing. Mobileye supplies front-facing camera systems that enable cars to detect obstacles and brake to prevent or mitigate collisions. Starting with 2018 models, both Volkswagen and BMW will outfit their vehicles with Mobileye systems that can also transmit their precise locations and images of the roads they are traveling, which can be synthesized into one giant digital map. Mr. Shashua said his company expected to sign on many other automakers to do the same. You can leverage the fact that you will have millions of cars with cameras  almost all the new cars that hit the road, he said. This is a force multiplier. Others are thinking along the same lines. A technology start-up called Civil Maps is trying to develop its own image-vacuuming device and hopes to persuade automakers to install it in cars and trucks. The company is also working on artificial intelligence technology that it hopes will automate the annotating of maps  the other big technological challenge. Its work has attracted an investment from Ford Motor.

Mobileye envisions assembling its data into a giant map called Road Book, and plans to share it with Here. The idea is that Here at some point will license the mapping information for use by self-driving cars and Mobileye will get a share of that, Mr. Shashua said. Some of the money will go back to automakers like VW and BMW that add the mapping capability to their cars. There is a revenue-sharing model between us and the carmakers, he said, noting that map services are a future business. Consumers would be paying for map services for their autonomous cars.  Photo        In an image from the Ford digital map of Mcity, colors denote objects like road signs and a fence that were detected by a laser-based sensing system.   Credit Ford    The reason digital maps are so important is that even the most advanced sensors, like radar and cameras, are not enough to enable a car to navigate a chaotic and changing world safely enough to allow occupants to lean back and take a snooze. Digital maps ease the burden by helping give foresight to a cars computers, and adding redundancy to the cars understanding of the situation it faces, said Civil Maps chief executive, Sravan Puttagunta. Radar and cameras cannot always recognize a stop sign if pedestrians are standing in the way or the sign has been knocked down, he explained. But if the map knows there is a stop sign ahead, then the sensors just need to confirm it, Mr. Puttagunta said. Then the load on the sensors and processor is much lower. The need for data that can complement radar and camera readings was made clear last year when an Ohio man, Joshua Brown, died in a crash in Florida when his 2015 Tesla Model S was operating under control of the electric car s Autopilot system. As the car was traveling on a state highway at 74 miles per hour, a white tractor-trailer was crossing the road, but Autopilots sensors had trouble recognizing it against a bright sky. Tesla has said Autopilot may have thought the truck was an overpass.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   A digital map could have shown that there was no overpass in that location and that an obstacle was blocking the road. As it was, neither the car nor Mr. Brown hit the brakes. An investigation of the crash by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration found no safety defect in Teslas Autopilot technology. It added, however, that Tesla needed to be cautious in its marketing and advertising not to overstate the capabilities of Autopilot, a semiautonomous system that requires drivers to keep their eyes on the road and hands on the steering wheel. Last fall, Tesla updated Autopilot, and one upgrade is a basic use of digital mapping. Cars that have the new software, known as Version 8, note the positions of road signs, bridges and other objects, and send the data to a Tesla database that other Tesla vehicles can draw on to make safe driving decisions. Tesla calls this fleet learning.   A version of this article appears in print on March 3, 2017, on Page B1 of the New York edition with the headline: Creating a Road Map for the Self-Driving Car.

In the video, recorded this month and reported on earlier by Bloomberg , Mr. Kalanick is seen in the back seat of an Uber car with two women. When they reach their destination, he begins talking with the driver, Fawzi Kamel. During the exchange, Mr. Kamel complains about what he says is Ubers history of lowering earnings for drivers, and Mr. Kalanick says Mr. Kamel should take responsibility for his own problems. The conversation quickly becomes heated, with Mr. Kalanick using obscenities and generally being dismissive of Mr. Kamels complaints.

In January, users and employees protested Mr. Kalanicks decision to join an economic advisory council for President Trump. After a week of intense backlash, Mr. Kalanick said he would give up the position .

Publish Date March 3, 2017.  .          SAN FRANCISCO  Uber has for years engaged in a worldwide program to deceive the authorities in markets where its low-cost ride-hailing service was resisted by law enforcement or, in some instances, had been banned. The program, involving a tool called Greyball, uses data collected from the Uber app and other techniques to identify and circumvent officials who were trying to clamp down on the ride-hailing service. Uber used these methods to evade the authorities in cities like Boston , Paris and Las Vegas, and in countries like Australia, China and South Korea. Greyball was part of a program called VTOS, short for violation of terms of service, which Uber created to root out people it thought were using or targeting its service improperly. The program, including Greyball, began as early as 2014 and remains in use, predominantly outside the United States. Greyball was approved by Ubers legal team. Greyball and the VTOS program were described to The New York Times by four current and former Uber employees, who also provided documents. The four spoke on the condition of anonymity because the tools and their use are confidential and because of fear of retaliation by Uber.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   Ubers use of Greyball was recorded on video in late 2014, when Erich England, a code enforcement inspector in Portland, Ore., tried to hail an Uber car downtown in a sting operation against the company.  Continue reading the main story         Advertisement   Continue reading the main story       At the time, Uber had just started its ride-hailing service in Portland without seeking permission from the city, which later declared the service illegal . To build a case against the company, officers like Mr. England posed as riders, opening the Uber app to hail a car and watching as miniature vehicles on the screen made their way toward the potential fares. But unknown to Mr. England and other authorities, some of the digital cars they saw in the app did not represent actual vehicles. And the Uber drivers they were able to hail also quickly canceled. That was because Uber had tagged Mr. England and his colleagues  essentially Greyballing them as city officials  based on data collected from the app and in other ways. The company then served up a fake version of the app, populated with ghost cars, to evade capture.   Portland vs. Uber: City code officers try to ticket drivers  Video by The Oregonian   At a time when Uber is already under scrutiny for its boundary-pushing workplace culture , its use of the Greyball tool underscores the lengths to which the company will go to dominate its market. Uber has long flouted laws and regulations to gain an edge against entrenched transportation providers, a modus operandi that has helped propel it into more than 70 countries and to a valuation close to $70 billion. Yet using its app to identify and sidestep the authorities where regulators said Uber was breaking the law goes further toward skirting ethical lines  and, potentially, legal ones. Some at Uber who knew of the VTOS program and how the Greyball tool was being used were troubled by it. In a statement, Uber said, This program denies ride requests to users who are violating our terms of service  whether thats people aiming to physically harm drivers, competitors looking to disrupt our operations, or opponents who collude with officials on secret stings meant to entrap drivers. The mayor of Portland, Ted Wheeler, said in a statement, I am very concerned that Uber may have purposefully worked to thwart the citys job to protect the public. Uber, which lets people hail rides using a smartphone app, operates multiple types of services, including a luxury Black Car offering in which drivers are commercially licensed. But an Uber service that many regulators have had problems with is the lower-cost version, known in the United States as UberX.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   UberX essentially lets people who have passed a background check and vehicle inspection become Uber drivers quickly. In the past, many cities have banned the service and declared it illegal. That is because the ability to summon a noncommercial driver  which is how UberX drivers using private vehicles are typically categorized  was often unregulated. In barreling into new markets, Uber capitalized on this lack of regulation to quickly enlist UberX drivers and put them to work before local regulators could stop them. After the authorities caught on to what was happening, Uber and local officials often clashed. Uber has encountered legal problems over UberX in cities including Austin, Tex., Philadelphia and Tampa, Fla., as well as internationally. Eventually, agreements were reached under which regulators developed a legal framework for the low-cost service. That approach has been costly. Law enforcement officials in some cities have impounded vehicles or issued tickets to UberX drivers, with Uber generally picking up those costs on the drivers behalf. The company has estimated thousands of dollars in lost revenue for every vehicle impounded and ticket received.  Photo        Ubers Greyball tool was developed to weed out riders thought to be using its service improperly.   Credit Mark Ralston/Agence France-Presse  Getty Images    This is where the VTOS program and the use of the Greyball tool came in. When Uber moved into a new city, it appointed a general manager to lead the charge. This person, using various technologies and techniques, would try to spot enforcement officers. One technique involved drawing a digital perimeter, or geofence, around the government offices on a digital map of a city that Uber was monitoring. The company watched which people were frequently opening and closing the app  a process known internally as eyeballing  near such locations as evidence that the users might be associated with city agencies. Other techniques included looking at a users credit card information and determining whether the card was tied directly to an institution like a police credit union.

To circumvent that tactic, Uber employees would go to local electronics stores to look up device numbers of the cheapest mobile phones for sale, which were often the ones bought by city officials working with budgets that were not large. In all, there were at least a dozen or so signifiers in the VTOS program that Uber employees could use to assess whether users were regular new riders or probably city officials.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   If such clues did not confirm a users identity, Uber employees would search social media profiles and other information available online. If users were identified as being linked to law enforcement, Uber Greyballed them by tagging them with a small piece of code that read Greyball followed by a string of numbers. When someone tagged this way called a car, Uber could scramble a set of ghost cars in a fake version of the app for that person to see, or show that no cars were available. Occasionally, if a driver accidentally picked up someone tagged as an officer, Uber called the driver with instructions to end the ride. Uber employees said the practices and tools were born in part out of safety measures meant to protect drivers in some countries. In France, India and Kenya, for instance, taxi companies and workers targeted and attacked new Uber drivers. Theyre beating the cars with metal bats, the singer Courtney Love posted on Twitter from an Uber car in Paris at a time of clashes between the company and taxi drivers in 2015. Ms. Love said that protesters had ambushed her Uber ride and had held her driver hostage . This is France? Im safer in Baghdad. Uber has said it was also at risk from tactics used by taxi and limousine companies in some markets. In Tampa, for instance, Uber cited collusion between the local transportation authority and taxi companies in fighting ride-hailing services. In those areas, Greyballing started as a way to scramble the locations of UberX drivers to prevent competitors from finding them. Uber said that was still the tools primary use. But as Uber moved into new markets, its engineers saw that the same methods could be used to evade law enforcement. Once the Greyball tool was put in place and tested, Uber engineers created a playbook with a list of tactics and distributed it to general managers in more than a dozen countries on five continents. At least 50 people inside Uber knew about Greyball, and some had qualms about whether it was ethical or legal. Greyball was approved by Ubers legal team, led by Salle Yoo, the companys general counsel. Ryan Graves, an early hire who became senior vice president of global operations and a board member, was also aware of the program.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   Ms. Yoo and Mr. Graves did not respond to requests for comment. Outside legal specialists said they were uncertain about the legality of the program. Greyball could be considered a violation of the federal Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, or possibly intentional obstruction of justice, depending on local laws and jurisdictions, said Peter Henning, a law professor at Wayne State University who also writes for The New York Times. With any type of systematic thwarting of the law, youre flirting with disaster, Professor Henning said. We all take our foot off the gas when we see the police car at the intersection up ahead, and theres nothing wrong with that. But this goes far beyond avoiding a speed trap. On Friday, Marietje Schaake, a member of the European Parliament for the Dutch Democratic Party in the Netherlands, wrote that she had written to the European Commission asking, among other things, if it planned to investigate the legality of Greyball.   To date, Greyballing has been effective. In Portland on that day in late 2014, Mr. England, the enforcement officer, did not catch an Uber , according to local reports. And two weeks after Uber began dispatching drivers in Portland, the company reached an agreement with local officials that said that after a three-month suspension, UberX would eventually be legally available in the city.

The company is said to be discussing how to make it easier for employees who leave to take their stock with them.   Credit Eric Risberg/Associated Press     Uber has lurched from one blow to its reputation after another. Now it is trying to contain some of the damage to employees. Uber, the privately held ride-hailing company, is considering ways to make its stock compensation policies more friendly to its workers, according to three people with knowledge of an employee meeting this week where Uber executives discussed the issue, and who asked to remain anonymous because the meeting was confidential. In particular, Uber is discussing how to potentially move away from severe restrictions around its stock so that employees who leave the company can take shares with them more easily, these people said. That would help Uber change the perception that it exerts too much control over stock compensation. The discussion comes after several scandals involving Uber. In January, the company contended with a #deleteUber campaign by riders who perceived Uber as profiting from President Trumps immigration ban. Last month, Uber grappled with questions about its workplace culture and a lawsuit over its self-driving cars . This week, it dealt with concerns over the character of its chief executive, Travis Kalanick, after a video of him berating an Uber driver became public.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   The events have buffeted employees at Ubers headquarters in San Francisco and elsewhere. Some have said that they plan to leave the company. On Friday, Ed Baker, vice president of product and growth, resigned from the company, a departure that was earlier reported by Recode.  Continue reading the main story         Advertisement   Continue reading the main story       Another Uber worker, who declined to be named, said that while some employees may have quit, turnover has not changed much in the last month. An Uber spokesman declined to comment. Stock compensation has long been an issue for Uber workers. Early employees, who joined the company several years ago, received stock options  which allow them to buy shares at a low price  as part of their compensation packages.

At other companies, departing employees get months or years to buy the shares. If Ubers workers do not buy the shares in the 30-day period, they forfeit the stock back to the company. Buying private company stock like Ubers also creates a tax bill for individuals, a bill that has swelled as Ubers valuation has soared to close to $70 billion. Some Uber employees have said they have been unable to come up with enough money to pay for their stock and the tax bill. They said that had left them little choice but to stay at the company and wait for a public offering of stock, or leave and give up stock that could someday be lucrative. Uber has moved over the years to give workers more options with their stock compensation. About two years ago, the company stopped using stock options for compensation and switched to restricted stock units, which do not incur a tax bill if employees leave the company. Uber has also given long-serving employees the opportunity to sell back a percentage of their shares to the company, in a program that was reported earlier by Bloomberg . The issue of stock options was raised again on Tuesday at an Uber employee meeting, the people with knowledge of the event said. At the meeting, one employee asked Mr. Kalanick whether he would consider giving them years after they leave the company to exercise their right to buy the companys stock and not just 30 days. Mr. Kalanick said the companys board had agreed to let management discuss the issue, though no decision had been made. He also asked Ubers head of human resources, Liane Hornsey, and general counsel, Salle Yoo, to help answer the employees question. It is unclear when the company may make any decisions about the stock compensation policies.   Katie Benner reported from New York and Mike Isaac from San Francisco.

The statement, denying that Otto stole any of Googles intellectual property, was paraphrased from an internal company email; it was not a direct quotation from Mr. Levandowski. INTERNATIONAL An article on Feb. 2 about the Dutch governments decision to hand-count all ballots in this months elections misidentified the institution where Herbert Bos, an expert on election integrity, is a professor. It is Vrije Universiteit in Amsterdam, not the University of Amsterdam. NATIONAL An article on Tuesday about the effect on the reputation of the accounting firm PricewaterhouseCoopers after its mistake on the Best Picture award at the Oscars rendered incorrectly the name of an advertising agency it recently selected. The agency is R/GA, not RG/A.  An Upshot article on Feb. 18 about the approval ratings of presidents referred incorrectly to Gerald R. Fords bid for the presidency in 1976. He was seeking election to a full four-year term; he was not running for re-election. (He was first appointed vice president and then ascended to the presidency after Richard Nixons resignation.)   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story    Because of an editing error, an article on Tuesday about rallies around the country in support of President Trump misstated the governmental structure of Mandeville.

It was Feb. 16, not Feb. 13. BUSINESS DAY The Common Sense column on Friday, about Cadillacs new advertising campaign, described the opening scene from a commercial incorrectly. The footage was of a recent street protest and was made to look archival, not of a civil rights demonstration from the 1960s. The column also misstated, at one point, the given name of a founder of the company that makes Budweiser beer, which was the subject of an ad campaign that recently became politically charged. He was Adolphus Busch, not Augustus.  An article on Thursday about technology start-ups efforts to take on the financial industry misstated the year that PayPal acquired Venmo. It was 2013, not 2009. SCIENCE TIMES An article on Tuesday about the timing of spring activity among Arctic plants misstated part of the results of a 2013 study of caribou. The researchers found that more caribou calves died early in years when spring plant growth preceded the animals calving season  not that fewer caribou calves were born. OBITUARIES An obituary on Sunday about the author and broadcaster Frank Delaney, an authority on James Joyces Ulysses, referred incorrectly to Leopold Bloom, the central character of that novel. He is the son of a Jewish immigrant from Hungary; he is not himself an immigrant. FOOD An article last Wednesday about Bayou Teche Brewing in Arnaudville, La., misstated the towns location. It is northeast of Lafayette, not northwest. The Times welcomes comments and suggestions, or complaints about errors that warrant correction.

Through their binoculars, the soldiers saw that the small group approaching us was waving a white flag, and so they held their fire.  Photo        The family included three women  one of them pregnant  two men, several children and a dog. The soldiers, with whom I was embedded this week, walked down the trail to intercept the group on the flank of a hill exposed to the Islamic States mortar rounds. I saw them help up the grandmother in the family, who was lagging behind. She reached the top of the ridge, clutching her heart and saying, Alhamdulillah, meaning Thank you, God.  Photo        The grandmothers name is Khadija Abbas. At the top of the ridge, she crumpled to the ground and held her open palms up to the sky. She took off her tattered plastic shoes and showed me that they were held together with string.  Photo        Ms. Abbas explained that at least 10 families related in some way to her were trapped in the village. They had sent her delegation ahead to see if it was safe to leave.

The officers had a list of people suspected of being members of Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL, and they immediately checked the familys identification cards against their list.  Photo        The Iraqi soldiers in our group, which also included a small unit of American advisers, gave one of the family members a cigarette, as the militants took over the area and forbade smoking nearly three years ago.  Photo        The pregnant woman began to feel faint. The New York Times teams medic ran to the car and came back with an IV drip to help with dehydration. She lay in a ditch as her husband stood above her, holding the bag of fluid.  Photo        As members of the family were catching their breath, a ripple of panic suddenly spread through the group: The troops spotted several cars speeding toward us and began firing warning shots.  Continue reading the main story         Advertisement   Continue reading the main story       The pregnant woman, who was still hooked up to the drip, and the grandmother, Ms. Abbas, began screaming that the people coming up the hill were their relatives. The Iraqi Army has suffered numerous casualties from car bombs detonated by Islamic State militants, and the soldiers were visibly on edge. Ms. Abbas pleaded with the troops, saying their relatives were in three white cars, two silver ones and a blue one. The Iraqi troops, using binoculars for a better view, confirmed her account and stopped firing.  Photo        No one was injured. Even the familys dog  which had scampered away when the gunfire erupted  was safe. Everyone is fleeing ISIS, even the animals, one of the villagers joked, when I asked why they had brought the dog with them. The family showed us the square of cloth they had used as a white flag to signal to the troops that they were civilians. In the barren desert surrounding their village, they said, they had been unable to find a stick to put it on.  Photo        By the end of the afternoon, more than 30 civilians had made it to the hill. When the terrorist group began lobbing mortar rounds in their direction, the Iraqi troops asked the families to move. Hours later, we saw a plume of smoke coming from car bombs in the area that the civilians had fled. By the end of the day, Iraqi forces declared it liberated.

Near Deal to Sell Opel to Peugeot Maker, PSA   By JACK EWING MARCH 4, 2017     Continue reading the main story  Share This Page   Continue reading the main story            Photo        An Opel dealership in Marseille, France.   Credit Jean-Paul Pelissier/Reuters     FRANKFURT  The French maker of Peugeot and Citroen cars is expected to announce on Monday that it will acquire General Motors Opel unit, in what amounts to a high-risk bet on the sluggish European market at a moment of acute political uncertainty. A General Motors official, who was not authorized to speak publicly about the deal, confirmed the sale on Saturday. Earlier, PSA Group, the parent company of Peugeot and Citroen, said that it would hold a joint news conference with G.M. on Monday morning in Paris. The two companies said last month that they were in talks for PSA to acquire Opel, G.M.s European unit. The deal would vault the combined company into second place in Europe behind Volkswagen, which makes the most cars in the region. And it would allow General Motors to shed a perennially money-losing division. Both PSA and Opel are focused heavily on Europe, where car sales peaked almost two decades ago and where populist movements are threatening to dismantle the single market .

Continue reading the main story         Advertisement   Continue reading the main story       For the deal to make any sense, Carlos Tavares, PSAs ambitious chief executive, will have to find a way to cut costs in countries where unions, political leaders and labor laws make layoffs and plant closures extremely difficult. Mr. Tavares has managed to haul PSA out of an existential crisis since taking charge three years ago, returning the company to profit in 2015 after closing a factory in France and cutting the automotive work force by more than a quarter. But the companys car sales have shrunk, and an effort to establish a foothold in China has stalled. Opel has also struggled to cut costs and has closed a factory in Bochum, Germany. Labor representatives, having already made major concessions, will most likely put up bitter resistance to further cuts. The biggest beneficiary of the deal may be G.M. Opel has not made a profit since the 1990s and has been a chronic headache for its parent, which has owned the carmaker based in Germany since 1929. Selling off Opel is a watershed event in G.M.s steady comeback from the last recession. The company tried to sell Opel in 2009, when G.M. filed for bankruptcy and needed a $49.5 billion government bailout to survive. But the deal collapsed, and since then, G.M. has repeatedly restructured Opel in an effort to reverse years of losses. Despite a succession of new senior executives, the business has failed to break even  at the same time G.M. has flourished in North America and China and begun to devote more resources to its self-driving vehicle program.

Selling Opel is another sign of G.M.s interest in healthy financials over volume or market reach, said Karl Brauer, an analyst with the auto-research firm Kelley Blue Book.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   Combined, PSA and Opel depend on Europe for 70 percent of their sales, according to calculations by Ferdinand Dudenhoffer, a professor at the University of Duisburg-Essen in Germany. The takeover of Opel increases the already very high dependence on Europe, Professor Dudenhoffer said in a written analysis of the deal Friday. It was precisely this dependence that led PSA into crisis. The European market has been in long-term decline. Car sales have been rebounding from a severe crisis in 2013, but total passenger car sales of 14 million last year were still well below the peak of 15 million in 1999. Opel and PSA have been losing ground in the market, in part because high-end carmakers like BMW and Daimlers Mercedes unit have been encroaching on their turf by selling more affordable cars. At the same time, the free trade that has prevailed in Europe since World War II is under attack. Britain, where Opels are sold under the Vauxhall brand, is one of the few markets where Opel is a leader. But Britain has voted to leave the European Union. Marine Le Pen is campaigning to be president of France on an anti-European Union platform and is given an outside chance of success. Opel and PSA would be able to operate more efficiently by combining operations like purchasing and design, and by sharing components like engines. They already cooperate and were expected to show a jointly designed sport-utility vehicle at the Geneva International Motor Show next week. But ultimately, the combined company will need to produce vehicles that are more attractive than those made by its competitors, something the companies have struggled to do separately.
