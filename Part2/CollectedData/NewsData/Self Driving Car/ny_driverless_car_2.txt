Ford sees mobility services as potentially more profitable than its traditional business of making and selling cars.   Credit Luke Sharrett/Bloomberg     SAN FRANCISCO  One of the oldest automakers in the United States is making a billion-dollar bet that one day, owning a car may not be a necessity of American life. Ford Motor announced on Friday its plans to invest $1 billion over the next five years in Argo AI, an artificial intelligence start-up formed in December that is focused on developing autonomous vehicle technology. The move is Fords biggest effort to move into self-driving car research. Argo AI will develop the technology exclusively for Ford at first, and then plans to license its technology to others. The investment is also a way for Ford, which is more than century old, to tap into Silicon Valley talent and make headway in a competitive space. Former Google and Uber self-driving technologists will lead the effort out of Pittsburgh, a hub for robotics and autonomous vehicle research, and satellite offices will be in place in the San Francisco Bay Area and southeastern Michigan.

But Argo AI will also use shares of its stock to lure robotics and engineering professionals from other companies, a challenge in a field where companies like General Motors, Chrysler, Uber and Google are all racing to bring autonomous vehicles to the mainstream.  Continue reading the main story         Advertisement   Continue reading the main story       If we can combine the best of a start-up and marry that with proper equity compensation, then thats the best of both worlds, Mark Fields, president and chief executive of Ford, said at an event with reporters in San Francisco on Friday. The move comes as Ford positions itself as not just a manufacturer of cars, but as a provider of mobility services, enabling people to get around without owning cars. That is especially important as companies like Uber and Lyft, ride-hailing services popular in urban areas, have reduced the need for people to have their own vehicles. Ford sees mobility services as potentially more profitable than its traditional business of making and selling cars. Manufacturing vehicles requires billions of dollars in investments in plants and engineering  costs that are often difficult to recoup. Company executives have said mobility services could generate returns of around 20 percent, compared with the 8 percent it earns on making vehicles today.

There is not a strong enough pipeline of talent coming out of the universities today, Bryan Salesky, chief executive and co-founder of Argo AI, said on Friday. Mr. Salesky said Argo AI was looking to hire 200 employees across its three offices by the end of the year. In the last several months, Ford acquired Chariot, a start-up that ferries commuters around the San Francisco area, and invested in Civil Maps, which is developing 3-D mapping technology that can be used by self-driving cars. In August, Ford also acquired SAIPS, an Israeli company developing machine learning and computer-vision technology. A year ago, Ford opened a research center in Palo Alto, Calif., a move Mr. Fields acknowledged was aimed at making Ford part of the ecosystem of Silicon Valley. Ford is also remaking its headquarters and main development center in Dearborn, Mich., just outside Detroit, into two sprawling, high-tech campuses of energy-efficient buildings  similar to those that dot Silicon Valley. The automaker envisions the new campuses, which will take 10 years to complete, as places that will showcase autonomous shuttles as well as electric bikes and other green modes of transportation. Other automakers are moving in the same direction. General Motors has invested $500 million in Lyft, a ride-hailing service and main rival of Uber. G.M. also acquired Cruise Automation, a maker of sensors and other gear that can enable conventional automobiles to drive themselves on highways.

Mr. Harms, chief executive at MOIA, a Volkswagen-backed ride-hailing start-up, moved to Berlin, which has a growing tech scene.   Credit Gordon Welters for The New York Times     WOLFSBURG, Germany  One of the first things Ole Harms did after taking over Volkswagen s new ride-hailing start-up was leave town. Staid Wolfsburg, Volkswagens home, was not the best place for the automaker to mount a defense against Silicon Valley challengers keen to upend the car industry, and he needed to move. Nobody knows how the world is going to look in the coming years, said Mr. Harms, a bearded 41-year-old dressed in a gray cardigan over a crisply pressed white shirt. The biggest skill you have to have is the ability to change. So he packed up and took his team to new digs in Berlin, where increasingly urgent attempts to tap into a growing tech scene are part of German carmakers efforts to ride a digital wave sweeping the industry  before it rolls straight over them.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   Autonomous driving, electric cars and ride-hailing apps from Silicon Valley, like Uber, are reshaping transportation. Young people no longer feel as compelled as previous generations to own cars. And Wall Street shows scant respect for automakers and their global manufacturing prowess: The market value of Google, which is building a driverless car, is more than double that of BMW , Daimler and Volkswagen combined.  Continue reading the main story         Advertisement   Continue reading the main story       At stake is the fate of the German economy, Europes largest, at a time when the region is only beginning to emerge from a decade-long economic malaise. Germany , in particular, is as dependent on its carmakers as Michigan is on Chrysler, Ford and General Motors. Industry executives here often cite how Apples iPhone quickly erased Nokias once-dominant position in the mobile handset market, and they are determined not to let something similar happen to them. I am convinced that we are going to see more change in the next 10 or 15 years than we have seen in the last 100 years, Peter Schwarzenbauer, a member of the BMW management board, said in a telephone interview. The big question is always, Do we car manufacturers learn to become tech companies more quickly than a tech company learns to be an automotive player? Non-German carmakers have readily embraced Silicon Valley through partnerships and investment deals. Fiat Chrysler, for instance, is working with Google on self-driving cars. General Motors has poured $500 million into Lyft, the ride-booking service. And Volvo, the Swedish automaker owned by Geely of China, provided the chassis for Ubers recent driverless car tests . By contrast, Germanys automotive giants have favored a more confrontational approach. That has been backed by many locals, who have so far rebuffed Ubers aggressive local expansion plans that have often run roughshod over domestic regulation, and by German politicians eager to please some of the countrys biggest employers. BMW, for example, is working with the chip maker Intel and Mobileye , an Israeli tech company, to develop a self-driving car of its own by early in the next decade. It has also formed a partnership with IBM to use artificial intelligence to allow vehicles to automatically adapt to their owners preferences. To combat the likes of Tesla, the California electric automaker, BMW is planning to expand its i Series line of battery-powered and hybrid vehicles. Since 2014, it has sold 100,000 of the i3 model, which runs on batteries and has a lightweight carbon fiber body.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   Daimler, the maker of Mercedes-Benz cars and trucks, has similarly been investing in digital alternatives. Of the three automakers, it has also been the only one so far to become an active partner with Uber , albeit in a limited deal where it provides a set of its autonomous vehicles to the ride service. Daimler also owns Car2Go, a short-term car rental service; Blacklane, an upmarket ride-hailing app; and MyTaxi, Europes largest taxi-hailing service. Andrew Pinnington, chief executive of MyTaxi, said the automakers backing had allowed it to expand rapidly across Europe, where it has often teamed up with local taxi associations to combat the rise of Uber. This is a game that requires deep pockets, Mr. Pinnington said. The German carmakers digital plans have led to increased collaboration between what have long been staunch rivals.

While not a household name, the Berlin-based company provides about 80 percent of the built-in navigation systems for cars in North America and Europe, and is the only large-scale competitor to Google Maps. The future of Germany as an industrial nation depends on how companies succeed in bringing the manufacturing and digital worlds together, said Frank Ridder, research leader for Germany, Austria and Switzerland for Gartner, a technology research firm. Taken together, the carmakers digital reboot is aimed at rejuvenating Germanys vaunted industrial base. About one-fifth of jobs in Germany are in manufacturing, double the portion in the United States. But factory jobs as a percentage of total employment have been declining for years, prompting the government to dole out hundreds of millions of euros in research and development funds to meld traditional manufacturing with the latest technology. The initiative, called Industry 4.0, reflects a dawning realization that Germanys historic success may not necessarily help the country thrive in a smartphone-centric world.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   The experience of Volkswagen is a case in point. The company, which is still dealing with its emissions cheating scandal , is the worlds biggest automaker, but was the slowest of the three to embrace the digital age, and is now trying to catch up. That is where Mr. Harms comes in. A former consultant at Capgemini, he joined the carmaker in 2008 and is now chief executive of MOIA, a new Volkswagen service that sits somewhere between ride-hailing services and traditional city bus networks. Unlike Uber, which has often run into resistance from officials in Europe, MOIA plans to cooperate with local governments and act as an extension of existing public transportation networks. Instead of lumbering buses following fixed routes, Mr. Harms said, MOIA shuttles will adjust their destinations and schedules according to customer demand. The vehicles will be electric, and in the future, some may be self-driving. MOIA has yet to sign any deals, but it is negotiating with cities including Hamburg and Berlin. It hopes to expand quickly into the United States and China. In smaller cities, Mr. Harms said, MOIA could offer an inexpensive form of public transportation, even though rivals like Uber and Didi Chuxing, a Chinese ride-hailing service, are already well established in many of these locations. The whole mobility market  transportation as a service  is just at the beginning, Mr. Harms said. Volkswagens recent push into new digital frontiers has taken on added momentum since Matthias Muller took over as chief executive after the emissions scandal . Under Mr. Muller, Volkswagen has set a goal of selling at least two million electric cars a year by 2025 as it tries to rebuild its image and reduce its dependence on diesel cars. In June, Volkswagen bought a piece of the ride-hailing business by investing $300 million in Gett, a taxi-hailing service available in cities including New York and London. But for Mr. Harms, the carmakers best hope of survival is if they can prove the value of owning big factories, even though most previous efforts by the industry  and other traditional sectors  to compete with digital upstarts have proved unsuccessful. A vehicle is extremely sensitive. You cant put out a beta version and then two weeks later an update, he said. We are the ones who already know how to do it very well.

Credit Christof Stache/Agence France-Presse  Getty Images     Germany has long been a leading player in the old economy. Were this 1980, we would call it a titan of industry. And its biggest industry, by far, is cars. Germany makes some of the worlds most popular vehicles, not to mention some of the finest. (Lets forget Dieselgate ). But this is no longer 1980, and the car industry isnt what it used to be. Across the globe, automakers are preparing for rapid change. There will be new sources of fuel  electric cars are becoming more and more popular  as well as new ways to drive, including, of course, cars that drive themselves.  Photo        Then theres the question of ownership. Today, most cars spend most of their day parked. Car-sharing services like Uber argue that thanks to technology, each car can become more productive  and if that happens, wed probably need far fewer cars. These changes could upend the German economy. But the Germans arent sleepwalking into the future, write Jack Ewing and Mark Scott. Executives at some of the countrys leading car companies are pushing a slate of initiatives that could change how we think of the German automotive sector. They are building or investing in car-sharing companies of their own, and they are expanding their electric options. But perhaps most interestingly, German car companies are starting to think of themselves as more than just manufacturers, and instead as incubators of new ideas. Its a very Silicon Valley way of thinking. As one executive told Mr. Ewing and Mr. Scott: The biggest skill you have to have is the ability to change.

Credit Oliver Weiken/European Pressphoto Agency     The Russian runner Mariya Savinova was stripped of her 2012 Olympic gold medal on Friday for doping, putting Caster Semenya in line to become a two-time champion. Savinova, who won the 800-meter title at the London Games ahead of Semenya, was also barred for four years by the Court of Arbitration for Sport. The court said that Savinova, 31, had been found to have been engaged in using doping from July 2010 until August 2013. In 2014, Savinova appeared, in footage recorded by the Russian doping whistle-blower Yulia Stepanova, to admit to having injected testosterone and taken the banned steroid oxandrolone. The footage helped spark a World Anti-Doping Agency inquiry into Russia and led to a re-examination of Savinovas blood samples. If the International Olympic Committee reallocates the medals from the 2012 final, Semenya would add that gold medal to the one she won last year in Rio de Janeiro.

His love of American cars is unusual in Japan.   Credit Ko Sasaki for The New York Times     TOKYO  Yoshihiro Masuis growling Ford hot-rod, its sides adorned with the Stars and Stripes, attests to his love of American cars  an unusual passion in Japan, where Toyota, Honda and other domestic brands rule the roads. Japanese cars dont break down, but theyre boring, said Mr. Masui, 67, a semiretired music producer. Besides the hot-rod  a replica Model T with a racecars engine  he owns a gleaming white Ford Thunderbird , the latest of nearly 70 Detroit-made vehicles he figures he has bought and sold over the years. You definitely stand out, he said. Detroit pines for a day when the sight of an American car on a Japanese street is not so notable. Even as Japanese cars have taken a wide portion of the United States market, American brands are barely visible in Japan, a situation that has long frustrated American auto executives and trade negotiators and has become a renewed source of political friction under President Trump.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   Mr. Trump accuses Japan of shutting American producers out, by throwing up regulatory barriers and rigging the currency market in favor of Japanese brands. They do things to us that make it impossible to sell cars in Japan, he said in a meeting with American executives last month.  Continue reading the main story         Advertisement   Continue reading the main story       Such talk is alarming in Japan, where the auto industry is a pillar of the economy. When Prime Minister Shinzo Abe meets Mr. Trump starting on Friday, averting a trade war will be at the top of his agenda. Mr. Abes government has been floating proposals, like using Japanese pension money to fund Mr. Trumps infrastructure plans , that might mollify the president and help offset Japans large trade surplus. To the Japanese, Mr. Trumps accusations about trade barriers can seem bizarre. Of course American cars dont sell in Japan, said Mr. Masui, whose admiration for American vehicles does not extend to their manufacturers marketing strategies. American cars have a bad image  they arent fuel-efficient, they break down, he said. Thats not really true anymore, but dealers dont make an effort to convince people. Ive never seen a TV commercial. You go to a car show, theyre not there. The cars are certainly not on the streets. Of the nearly five million cars and light trucks sold in Japan last year, just 15,000 were American, or 0.3 percent. Toyota sells more vehicles at a single mega-dealership in California. Masato Suzuki manages a car dealership in Machida, a suburb west of Tokyo, that specializes in American imports. His lot is lined with hulking Lincoln Navigator S.U.V.s, full-size commercial vans and muscle cars like Dodge Chargers and Ford Mustangs. These are the sort of American vehicles that people buy in Japan, when they buy them at all. He says his customers are overwhelmingly men. I mean this affectionately, but theyre a bit unusual, he said. I suppose were a bit unusual to sell these cars, too. Mr. Suzukis dealership, Glide, opened 24 years ago, when Detroits reputation for quality was at a low. The cars broke down all the time. Customers were always angry at us, he said. Glide has since opened two branches, but they deal only in European cars, which are more popular in Japan.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   Mr. Suzuki said he would like to expand his offerings to smaller, more budget-friendly American vehicles  the kind that are the staple of Japans own auto industry, and which most Japanese drive. But he doesnt think they would sell. Ingrained skepticism about American cars reliability and fuel efficiency is one problem. Another is price. Mr. Suzuki said he did not know whether Japan was deliberately weakening the yen, as Mr. Trump claims, but he agrees with the American president that a stronger Japanese currency is better for American car sales.  Photo        Japanese cars dont break down, but theyre boring, Yoshihiro Masui said. He estimates that he has bought and sold nearly 70 American-made vehicles.   Credit Ko Sasaki for The New York Times    When the yen soared after the 2008 global financial crisis, making imports cheaper for Japanese buyers, Glide was importing about 100 vehicles a month. Now, with the yen weaker again, it brings in only one-tenth as many. Most of the time, for the same money, a Japanese car is a better deal, he said. Defenders of Japans trade practices note that Japan imposes no border taxes on cars, whereas the United States adds a 2.5 percent tariff to Japanese imports. And they point to the relative success of European brands. Mercedes-Benz, BMW and others have captured about 6 percent of the Japanese market, mostly at the luxury end.

Privacy Policy  Opt out or contact us anytime      German cars are popular in Japan, but American cars hardly sell at all, Akio Mimura, chairman of the Japan Chamber of Commerce and Industry, said at a news conference this month. If theyre going to sell cars in Japan, its obvious that they need to make an effort to appeal to Japanese customers. Yet, even European carmakers complain that the Japanese market can be tough going, with taxes, safety standards and other rules that they think favor domestic producers. Negotiators for the European Union are pressing Japan on such structural issues in talks over a proposed trade accord. An example is headlights. In many countries, it is standard practice for drivers to keep their headlights on during the day, for safety reasons. Many cars daytime running lights switch on automatically as soon as the engine is started. Japan, though, took the opposite approach for years: Keeping headlights on during the day was illegal. That meant foreign carmakers had to disable the automatic feature on cars they exported to Japan, an extra production stop that added to costs. Kenji Kobayashi, executive director of the Japan Automobile Importers Association, which represents foreign car companies in Japan, says structural barriers are lower than they used to be. Japan scrapped the prohibition on daytime running lights last year, after negotiations with the association.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   It is also reducing the tax advantages it gives to a category of microcars known as kei cars, which account for about a third of domestic sales and are made only by Japanese automakers. The change is making a difference: Kei sales dropped 9 percent last year. Mr. Trumps approach to trade is arguably slowing progress. During negotiations over the Trans-Pacific Partnership, the Pacific Rim trade deal Mr. Trump abandoned after taking office, Japan agreed to recognize more American auto safety standards and streamline certification procedures for imported vehicles. But now that the United States has pulled out, those concessions are at risk. Mr. Kobayashi sees a difference between European and American efforts to woo Japanese car buyers. European brands advertise aggressively and have done more to customize their products for Japan, for instance by producing right-hand-drive versions of their vehicles  a seemingly obvious selling point, in a country where the driving lane is on the left, that American producers have long been criticized for ignoring. The best-selling American brand in Japan is Jeep, which last year accounted for close to half of all American auto sales there. It offers right-hand-drive vehicles  a legacy of the customized delivery vehicles it once made for the United States Postal Service, which let drivers step out onto American curbs instead of the road. Catching up to the Europeans would require investments that American carmakers are increasingly reluctant to make, Mr. Kobayashi said. Ford scrapped its small dealer network last year, and is focusing in China. China is big and growing, and foreign brands are putting their efforts there, Mr. Kobayashi said. Mr. Masui, the car collector with the souped-up Model T, says he loves everything about America before the 1960s  cars, furniture, music, everything. He might well get along with President Trump. But he says American automakers should stop complaining about trade barriers and focus on more basic tasks: making attractive cars and persuading people to buy them. Mr. Trump is interesting, he said, but what he says about cars is just weird.   Correction: February 16, 2017   A picture caption with an article on Friday about the difficulties of selling American cars in Japan referred incorrectly to a quotation. As the article correctly noted, the source of the quotation was President Trump, not Yoshihiro Masui, a Japanese enthusiast of American cars, and Mr. Trump said that Japan, not Detroit, does things that make it impossible for United States automakers to sell cars in Japan.

But the Turbo is still a rocket.   Publish Date February 9, 2017.  Photo by Martin Campbell.  Watch in Times Video          embed            The second-generation Porsche Panamera had been in my possession for less than 24 hours when I noticed a trend. When enthusiasts locked eyes onto the car, they made a beeline to the back. Each said the same thing: It looks so much better! In my week with this Porsche I witnessed this unfold a dozen times. You see, while Porsche describes the Panamera as the sports car among luxury sedans, the first generations awkward roofline was considered by many to be the hunchback of luxury sedans. In Victor Hugos novel The Hunchback of Notre-Dame, Quasimodos disfigurement is a birth defect. With the original Panameras hump, it was a choice. The tall Wendelin Wiedeking, the former chief executive of Porsche, insisted that the back seat accommodate his frame. The all-new four-seat sequel is much sleeker, though, with a rear fly line cribbed from the 911 (an element I heard a Bugatti designer praise as a work of art). Over all, the aluminum body panels form classic organic Porsche design, without superfluous fins, gills and wings. The rear spoiler emerges when aerodynamics dictate purpose (around 56 miles an hour or when manually deployed). The Optimus Prime maneuver is a crowd pleaser.

All Panameras, even the E-Hybrid, are twin-turbocharged.  Continue reading the main story         Advertisement   Continue reading the main story       A new crisp 8-speed dual-clutch transmission snicks through cog changes like finger snaps. Its electronic controller requires deliberate action when selecting drive or reverse. There is the requisite manual mode with steering wheel paddles plus drive settings. Optional air suspension changes ride height. The available adjustable and active suspension changes ride quality. Panamera was never a lumbering church dweller. But the new Turbo with all-wheel drive is now sinfully quicker. Porsche claims the 0-60 m.p.h. sprint is a blistering 3.4 seconds on its way to a top speed of 190 m.p.h. Its very easy to drive very fast ... uh, so I hear. Although the car is dressed in luxury livery, even inexperienced drivers will sense the sports car in its bones. On Germanys famed Nurburgring, Frank Wiesmann of Porsche Cars North America says, Panamera Turbos lap time of 7:38 squeaks out a victory over the very capable Cayman GT4. The chance of motion sickness in the back seat is high. Still, the Panamera is docile during everyday tasks. Optional rear axle steering parallels the front wheels aim at high speed and does the opposite in parking lot maneuvers to provide a tidy turning radius. I drove 400 miles in a day and was refreshed at the end of it. It could have been from the optional massaging seats (I prefer the shiatsu setting) or the dont-miss Burmester audiophile sound system. Either way, its a great way to eat up miles. On start-up, Panamera defaults to a fuel-saving auto engine start/stop mode that can switch off the engine before the car comes to a complete stop. Those who find that disconcerting can disable it. The standard drive mode perceptively grabs the highest gear ratio possible, earnestly reaching for the E.P.A. rating of 18 city/25 highway. I saw 20 miles per gallon in aggressive driving. Panameras cabin has become a calm space that is no longer a recruiting tool for Air Force pilots. Replacing a blizzard of buttons on the center console is a haptic touch surface. The center air vent is adjusted on the 12.3-inch LCD screen. A clever show, but sometimes you just want to grab a knob. The snappy touch-screen interface is significantly improved over the outgoing system. Still, Ill give the edge to Volvos layout for now. Porsche provides redundant menu options below the display.

Two entertaining options are the G-force meter and night vision that graphically and audibly points out pedestrians and cyclists. The rear quarters are supremely comfortable for two. Optioned up with a climate zone and touch-screen interface of its own, passengers will be happy to ride in back. Well, maybe not on the Nurburgring. Im uncertain if Mr. Wiedeking has adequate headroom, but the Executive model with 5.9 inches of wheelbase stretch should cure any legroom issues. While Porsche calls the Panamera a sedan, it has a hatchback. Despite its trimmer silhouette, the cargo area has become more spacious. The seats split and fold, too. There is a strong argument for selling this as a practical purchase to your spouse. Frugal mates will put the kibosh on those plans. A base Panamera with rear-wheel drive begins at $86,050. The tested Turbo model starts at about $148,000 before winding up at $181,000. Look at it this way, that is less than a 911 Turbo S and it holds four comfortably. This second-generation Panamera offers a no-compromise attitude toward luxury. The sleeker design has Porsches back.

Credit Mark Zaleski/Associated Press..     A woman whose apparent suicide attempt led to the death of a Nashville police officer last week was arrested on Monday  the same day that a memorial service was held for the officer. The woman, Juli Glisson, 40, was released from a hospital and arrested and charged with aggravated vehicular homicide and probation violation, according to the Metropolitan Nashville Police Department. On Thursday, she was operating a car that dragged Officer Eric Mumaw to his death in a suburban Nashville river, according to an arrest warrant affidavit. Officer Mumaw gave it everything he had right up until that final moment when he did what he had always done: He served and protected us, Mayor Megan Barry of Nashville said at the memorial service. Officer Mumaw was posthumously awarded the Medal of Valor, the departments highest honor. He and two other officers had been called early Thursday morning to the Cumberland River, where they found an intoxicated Ms. Glisson in a vehicle on a boat ramp near the waters edge, according to the affidavit. They had been alerted to the situation by a family member who noted that Ms. Glisson had been suicidal in the past, according to the police.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   The car was running and in park when another officer, Trent Craig, began talking to Ms. Glisson. She asked him what would happen if she drove into the river, and he said that the responding officers would have to try to save her life, according to his account in the affidavit. At some point, Ms. Glisson shifted the cars gears. After failing to stop her, Officer Craig backed away. Officer Mumaw, however, had been trying to open the drivers door and was not able to move away in time. He slipped on the slick ramp, and the vehicle pulled him into the river, where he died, the police said.  Continue reading the main story         Advertisement   Continue reading the main story       Ms. Glisson admitted to having had seven or eight beers before speaking with the officers and had a blood alcohol level of 0.21 percent, according to the affidavit, more than two and a half times the legal limit. Bond was set at $150,000.  Continue reading the main story        Were interested in your feedback on this page. Tell us what you think.                   What's Next    Loading...

The police said a mentally disturbed man threw a gasoline bomb.  By MEGAN SPECIA on Publish Date February 10, 2017.  Photo by Apple Daily, via Reuters.  Watch in Times Video          embed            HONG KONG  A rush-hour commute in Hong Kong turned to panic Friday evening when a man ignited an incendiary device in a crowded subway train, filling the car with flames and smoke and injuring at least 17 people. Photographs taken soon after passengers fled the burning subway car show a man, believed to have started the fire, standing on a platform as flames jumped from the tatters of his burning clothes. Other images show injured commuters, their faces wrapped in gauze, being treated by emergency workers. The police said the man, whom they identified only as a 60-year-old with the surname Cheung, admitted starting the blaze and was charged with suspicion of arson. Violent crime is exceptionally rare in Hong Kong, home to one of the worlds largest subway systems. Annual ridership ranks just below that of New York, according to the Mass Transit Railway Corporation in Hong Kong.

Continue reading the main story         Advertisement   Continue reading the main story       The South China Morning Post reported that passengers heard the man say that he would burn you to death before lighting the device, and local television stations reported that he was carrying a document identifying him as a psychiatric patient. The police would not confirm those details, but fire officials said the blaze was caused by the ignition of a combustible material.

Employees and commuters helped put out the flames after the train, traveling on the Tsuen Wan line, arrived at Tsim Sha Tsui station, where it was evacuated. Of the 17 people hospitalized, two were in critical condition, five were in serious condition, nine were in stable condition and one was released, according to the Hospital Authority. Hong Kongs chief executive, Leung Chun-ying, expressed sympathy for the victims in a statement, and he asked the territorys food and health secretary, Ko Wing-man, to visit the hospitalized passengers. The last major arson attack on a subway train in Hong Kong occurred on Jan. 5, 2004 , when a fire broke out as a train was arriving at the Admiralty station. Fourteen people were injured. That fire was set by a man using newspapers, a lighter and a bottle believed to contain gasoline.   Follow Alan Wong on Twitter @alanwongw . Sewell Chan contributed reporting from London.
