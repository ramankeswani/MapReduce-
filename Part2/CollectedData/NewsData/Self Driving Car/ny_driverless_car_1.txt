Credit Jake Naughton for The New York Times        In the race to find someone  anyone  to lash out at over the immigration and travel restrictions ordered by President Trump last Friday, many consumers settled on an odd target: Uber. It had, supposedly, undercut prices for non-Uber taxis just as protesting taxi drivers went back to work. A boycott brigade formed almost immediately. On Sunday, in response to the same executive order on immigration, Starbucks announced plans to hire 10,000 refugees around the world. Then another boycott action began, started by people who couldnt understand why the company wasnt hiring 10,000 unemployed people in the United States. Both groups had the same goal, whether they were trying to stick it to the president or stick with him: to bring the fight to the companies that may (or may not) do the literal bidding of the new administration. And their weapon was their daily budget. Both actions, however, were not actual boycotts, at least if you ask a purist. They are calls for boycotts, said Monroe Friedman, the unofficial dean of American boycott studies and an emeritus professor of psychology at Eastern Michigan University. Sustaining a true boycott, he noted, requires more than a hashtag.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   So what makes a true boycott work? And was it the call for a boycott of Uber that prompted the companys founder, Travis Kalanick, to quit Mr. Trumps economic advisory council on Thursday?

Sometimes, in the desire to make big changes fast, activists take a fire-hose approach. Consider the efforts of the anti-Trump organizers at Grabyourwallet.org . They offer a helpful list of the top 10 companies to boycott. Then, the small-font spreadsheet lists several dozen more, from most boycott-able to least. Uber was midway down that list. As well intentioned as it may be, this makes for some exhausting reading. Its also exhaustive  so much so that the organizers felt duty-bound to include a list of entities not being boycotted at this time. It is O.K., for instance, to shop in a bookstore, even if that store sells a book by Mr. Trump. As of Thursday, however, the movement was claiming a scalp: Nordstrom, its top target, said it was not ordering anything from Ivanka Trump and her fashion line this season.

Outrage tends to fall into two general categories, according to Daniel Diermeier, who is the provost at the University of Chicago and wrote about the topic for Harvard Business Review back when he was a business school professor at the Kellogg School of Management at Northwestern University. First, there are the one-sided issues. No one, he said in an interview this week, is on the side of child labor, for instance. These kinds of boycotts tend to draw more supporters and have a greater chance of success. But if youre organizing a boycott around a more polarizing issue  say, who deserves to come to a country, for how long and for what reasons  you can expect that for any consumer action, there will be an equal and opposite reaction. The #DeleteUber campaign prompted #BoycottLyft after that company announced a $1 million donation to the American Civil Liberties Union. At the same time, Starbucks fans who support the companys outreach to refugees gleefully tweeted about supersizing their Frappuccinos to start this week.

Boycotts ensued  but good luck to you if your goal is to change the mind of a guy like that. And if youre going to try, dont send him letters telling him that youre not going to buy his tea anymore. (He doesnt sell it.) And dont give him a reason to disparage your intellect by misspelling chef as chief. Dan Savage, the columnist , podcaster and co-founder of  It Gets Better , a project that supports lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender youths, helped organize a boycott of Stolichnaya in 2013, to protest Russias treatment of gays and lesbians. He knew he could not change the companys identification with Russia. But by picking on a company strongly associated with a particular type of country, the boycotters could send a message to other nations that their prejudice would not go unnoticed. These are failing countries attempting to assume moral superiority over the West, Mr. Savage said. Whatever else is wrong there, at least theyre beating up queers and keeping them from getting married or speaking about themselves publicly. Separately, in the boycott world, the movement that led to the end of o rca breeding at SeaWorld in San Diego is one good example of a well-chosen goal. It was something the company could do that was within their control, without ceasing to be who they were, said Robert N. Mayer, a professor of family and consumer studies at the University of Utah. EASE Deleting the Uber app from a smartphone is easy enough, especially when Lyft and others offer reasonable substitutes. Caffeination is available everywhere and third-wave cafes offer better coffee than Starbucks anyhow.  Photo        Demonstrators at a California Coastal Commission meeting in Long Beach in 2015. The protest movement led to the end of orca breeding at SeaWorld in San Diego.   Credit Damian Dovarganes/Associated Press    Other boycotts may not be so simple, though. For instance, no one makes a chicken sandwich quite like Chick-fil-A, so people who crave one but dislike the companys historical support of organizations that oppose same-sex marriage are in a pickle. A friend of mine once suggested a solution: gay marriage offsets. Have a sandwich, then take the same amount of money and donate it to, say, the Human Rights Campaign . Mr. Diermeier invoked the Disney example: Good luck talking a child out of a promised trip to its theme parks. (Disney has, for whatever reason, stayed silent on the travel ban thus far, even though it has this built-in protection of the youth vote.)   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   SIMPLICITY For a boycott to take hold, the precipitating action must be easy to explain. In Ubers case, however, it wasnt. It had sent a tweet noting that the surge pricing it puts in place when demand is high had been lifted. That led to accusations that it was trying to undercut prices of taxi drivers who had just been involved in a work stoppage to protest the presidents travel ban. But if the company had left the surge on, the same protesters would have probably accused it of profiteering off the work stoppage. So there was no way for Uber to win, though if it had posted no Twitter message at all it might have escaped notice. Still, this alone is hardly the cause for a boycott. So whats really going on here? In some ways, Uber is getting exactly what it deserves. After all, it has run roughshod over various regulatory bodies for years, blithely waved away  insurance concerns and then left town  as it did in Austin , Tex.  when the authorities put reasonable rules in place. Even worse, these tactics worked brilliantly. The internet, apparently, means never having to follow the rules. As useful as Uber is, there are likely large numbers of consumers whose loyalty to it is begrudging. So, how many of them deleted the app, perhaps having long wanted to? More than 200,000 according to my colleague Mike Isaac  enough that Uber had to install a new mechanism to make it easier for people to delete their accounts. Well probably never know exactly how much the boycott affected Mr. Kalanicks choice to quit Mr. Trumps advisory board, or whether he did so because his employees urged him to. Its possible they could no longer stand the perception that their boss was helping a president whom many of them loathe. According to Mr. Friedman, the boycott dean, a true, successful boycott requires a sustained campaign and plenty of money or time. Consumers who dont have much of either, however, can take heart in one big change that the travel-ban controversy has revealed. For the last week, scores of companies have felt compelled to make statements about a new president and an important piece of policy. Few, if any, of any size offered full-throated support of the ban. It is now more clear than ever that the companies where we spend our billions answer to us. Pummel the ones that you disagree with for their views, or criticize the ones that are too cowardly to side with the man their country elected. But no matter what you feel about what is going on in Washington, isnt it rather nice to see large corporations back on their heels a bit?

Some Twitter uses interpreted a message from the company as trying to profit from President Trumps executive order on immigrants.   Credit Robert Galbraith/Reuters     If youve been paying attention to Twitter for the past few days, you may have noticed a trending hashtag: #DeleteUber. Thats because there has been a backlash against Uber in response to accusations that the ride-hailing service intended to profit from a protest on Saturday against President Trumps executive order banning refugees and immigrants from certain countries from entering United States. Uber maintains that its intentions were misunderstood. That hasnt stopped the online movement  spurred almost entirely through Twitter  of people deciding to delete their Uber accounts. On Tuesday, many users accused Uber of not actually deleting their accounts, despite having been asked to do so. Since much of the conversation has played out on Twitter and confusion about the matter continues, we thought we would lay out the issues here.

On Saturday, after the president issued his executive order , a union representing taxi drivers in New York City issued a statement refusing to pick up passengers at Kennedy Airport  the center of the protest  from 6 p.m. to 7 p.m.  Continue reading the main story         Advertisement   Continue reading the main story       At 7:30 p.m., Uber posted a message on Twitter saying it had turned off its surge pricing feature, a function that increases the cost of a ride during times of high demand. Some interpreted the alert as an opportunistic attempt to attract business, even though it was sent a half-hour after the protest. One Twitter user, @Bro_Pair, saw the message and called widespread attention to it, resulting in the hashtag #DeleteUber. The hashtag was trending on Twitter widely in the United States for much of Saturday night and Sunday. Uber said its message was not an attempt to capitalize on the taxi drivers strike, but a notification to users that the company would not be increasing prices at a time of high demand. So if I want to delete my account, can I? Yes, you can and have always been able to do so. Directions are on the user support page of the Uber site.

Essentially, the issue is that Uber has never had an automated process that allowed users to delete accounts. This was something that has been in Ubers plans for years, but was expedited over the weekend because of the high volume of requests, according to two people at the company. Before that, if users wanted to delete their accounts, someone at Uber had to do it manually. Thats clearly not a reasonable way to handle a large number of requests. With the volume of deletion requests particularly high, Uber had to create an automated process quickly, which it did and put in place late Sunday.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   Uber included a security check to the process: Anyone who asked to delete an account received an email with a unique link. The added step was meant to protect against the fraudulent deletion of accounts, for example. Now, users who want to delete their accounts must sign on using their passwords at the Uber site, then click on the unique link after receiving the email from Uber. Users trying to delete their accounts may encounter an error message, which can happen for two reasons. First, there may be remaining credits in an account, causing the system to become confused. Users with credits should receive a message asking if they want to forfeit those credits before going on to delete their accounts. The second potential problem involves users who also drive for Uber. Those users should be asked whether they want to delete their driver accounts, as well. Once all those steps have been completed, Uber says, your account should indeed be deleted. Wow! That sounds serious! Youre darn right it does. The greater point, in my eyes, is that Uber was forced to create an ad hoc, automated system for deleting accounts because of how many requests it was getting. Thats significant. Here is Ubers official statement on the issue, by the way, from a company spokesman: Anyone who requested that their account be deleted will have their account deleted, and reports to the contrary are false. Over the weekend we implemented a new automated process to handle an increased volume of requests and implemented a password check, a security best practice to avoid abuse and fraud. Crazy. So, should I delete my account? Im not here to tell you what to do. For what its worth, Uber says it has set aside a $3 million fund to help drivers affected by the immigration ban. A lot of people decided to delete Uber and start using Lyft, but if youre doing that to protest President Trumps actions, you should probably know that Peter Thiel and Carl Icahn  two of Mr. Trumps major supporters and advisers  also own substantial shares in Lyft. Take that how you will. Whatever the case, it seems as if Ubers long history of being aggressive and developing a reputation as a bully of the transportation industry has come back to bite it at the worst possible time. Perhaps that wont affect Uber in the long term, but it sure looks painful right now.  Continue reading the main story        Were interested in your feedback on this page.

Next week hes going to decapitate another car, probably a Cadillac ATS. At first glance it might seem a crazy idea, but to Mr. Moran its a growing business. His company, Drop Top Customs, in High Springs, Fla., specializes in extreme automotive makeovers  mainly of turning cars like the Challenger and the ATS into convertibles. We did 60, 65 cars last year, and well probably do twice that this year, Mr. Moran said by telephone while taking a break from vehicular surgery. I think were coming into a nice upswing again. The rising demand at Drop Top Customs is a stark contrast to the overall convertibles business. Car sales in general are slumping, as Americans flock to roomy models like sport utility vehicles that are more suited to family life and active living. And convertible sales are in a tailspin.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   Automakers sold just over 111,000 convertibles in the first 11 months of 2016, according to Edmunds.com, an auto-shopping website. A total for the full year has not yet been compiled. But considering that few convertibles are sold in cold-weather months, the industry is sure to register a steep decline from the 2015 total of almost 134,000.  Continue reading the main story         Advertisement   Continue reading the main story       Fewer than 1 percent of all the new vehicles sold in the American market are convertibles. Back in their heyday, in the 60s, they made up about 6 percent of the total. A lot of people like the idea of a convertible on a sunny day, but for a daily drive, it can be a grind, said Jessica Caldwell, a senior analyst at Edmunds.com . Theyre just not very practical unless it is your second or third car. As sales have declined, automakers have pulled many convertible models, like the Toyota Solara, Pontiac Solstice and Ford Thunderbird, as well as the drop-top versions of the Chrysler Sebring, PT Cruiser, Lexus SC and Mini Cooper. Among those still chugging along: the Ford Mustang, the Chevrolet Camaro and a variety of expensive models from European luxury brands.  Photo        Jeff Moran, the owner of Drop Top Customs in High Springs, Fla., said his company converted 60 to 65 cars to convertibles last year.   Credit Charlotte Kesl for The New York Times    Topless driving, with the sun shining in, retains its powerful allure for some people, though, even as convertibles lose their broader appeal. That is where businesses like Drop Top Customs have stepped in. After the factory-built roofs are buzzed off, Mr. Moran and his crew install convertible tops of his own design. He also welds additional steel supports to the underbody, to make up for the strength and stiffness that the rigid roof normally provides. Doors, windows, seatbelts and other parts are modified, too. He charges $18,000, and has a backlog of orders. Last year, Dale Laur, a nurse anesthetist from North Branch, Mich., ordered a 2016 Dodge Challenger with a Hemi V8 engine and a purple finish  Plum Crazy, its called. He had the car shipped directly from the factory to Drop Top Customs in High Springs, 75 miles southwest of Jacksonville. I just love how it feels in a convertible, Mr. Laur said. Its freedom, wind in your hair.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   After the transformation was complete, Mr. Laur flew down to Florida, picked up the car and headed north. On the road and at most every stop, he said, people stared and took pictures of the car. While still on the road, he learned one of the photos had already found its way onto a Detroit muscle car blog.

Wed be riding along the freeway and people were pulling up next to us, waving and taking pictures, thumbs up. Ken Kelly, a classic car dealer from Texas, had Drop Top Customs modify a 2013 Challenger SRT8, and people would come up and offer to buy the car. He sold it after about a year, making enough to cover all his costs and then some. He recently bought a Hellcat Challenger, which features a huge 707-horsepower Hemi engine, and has sent it off to Mr. Moran, too. Im pretty sure it will be the only Hellcat Challenger convertible in existence, Mr. Kelly said. He figures hell drive it for a bit and then sell it for a profit.  Photo        The work space of Drop Top Customs. It takes about two to three weeks to change a sedan into a convertible.   Credit Charlotte Kesl for The New York Times    It takes about two to three weeks to change a sedan into a convertible. Before any cutting begins, the car is stripped of its hood, body panels, seats and interior. Next, steel supports, mainly square tubing, are welded to the underbody and behind the wheels. All told, about 200 pounds of steel are added to the car. Mr. Moran is not an engineer, but he draws on a long previous career as a police officer specializing in accident reconstruction, work that gave him knowledge of how cars are built to withstand crashes. Once the steel is in place, the cutting begins and the roof is removed. New power windows replace the fixed windows in the rear seat. Small connectors or jigs that will secure the new folding roof are welded to the cars body, and then the roof itself is welded in place. Mr. Moran noted that all his components are American made. Glass windows come from Ohio, the tops from the Carolinas, hydraulic cylinders from Kentucky. Drop Top Customs isnt the only company filling the desires of people like Mr. Laur. Newport Convertible Engineering in Southern California also creates convertibles. Much of its work involves high-end luxury cars, like Ferraris and Lamborghinis. It has offices in Dubai and Barcelona, Spain, to serve customers in the Middle East and Europe.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   There are wealthy people around the world who have no issue with money, and they will spend whatever it takes to get something thats truly unique, said Al Zadeh, who founded Newport Convertible Engineering in 1983. The company is working on an order for 100 Tesla Model S convertibles from an investor who hopes to turn a profit selling them to rich car enthusiasts in China and elsewhere. This week it also announced a plan to create convertible versions of the Ford F-150 pickup truck. We think this is going to be a big hit, Mr. Zadeh said. It will sell like hot cakes. Ed Pobur, the general manager of a Cadillac dealership in Novi, Mich., thinks theres still potential for convertible sales. The ATS that Mr. Moran will cut into soon is one of two Mr. Pobur sent to Drop Top Customs to be transformed, and hes eager to have them in his showroom as spring arrives. Were going to display them on the corner in front of the dealership. Well put the top down to show it off, he said. And hopefully well be ordering a bunch more.

Credit Marie Turner/Associated Press     A grand jury indicted Ronald Gasser Jr. on Thursday in the fatal shooting of the former N.F.L. player Joe McKnight , handing down a second-degree murder charge. The charge is more severe than the one that Mr. Gasser had initially faced in December, when critics complained that racial bias may have affected the investigation. If convicted, Mr. Gasser, 54, would face life in prison with no parole. The death of Mr. McKnight, 28, a star running back at the University of Southern California who later played for the Jets and Kansas City Chiefs in the N.F.L., spurred several days of protests. Supporters and Mr. McKnights former teammates were outraged after the police initially freed Mr. Gasser . Though the authorities said Mr. Gasser had admitted to the shooting on Dec. 1, he was not arrested and charged until four days later.

Credit Jefferson Parish Sheriff's Office    Mr. Gasser was initially charged with manslaughter over what the authorities described as a road rage confrontation in Terrytown, La., about five miles southeast of New Orleans. Subsequent to that arrest, the Jefferson Parish Sheriffs Office and the Jefferson Parish District Attorneys Office continued working together in a collaborative effort to develop additional evidence regarding the case, the district attorneys office said in a statement Thursday. Todays indictment comes as a result of that joint effort.  Photo        Joe McKnight in 2013.   Credit NFLPV, via Associated Press    Mr. Gassers bond was also increased to $750,000. The delayed arrest and lesser initial charge had angered critics, who said that Mr. Gasser, the owner of a telecommunications firm and a real estate business, may have been afforded more leeway because he is white, or that the authorities were less invested in swift justice for a black mans death.

Investigators conducted more than 160 interviews and spoke to Mr. Gasser for more than 12 hours, Sheriff Normand said at a news conference in December.

When they stopped next to each other at a red light, Mr. McKnight got out of his car and approached the window of Mr. Gassers car, the sheriff said. Mr. Gasser then pulled out a handgun from between his seat and the console and shot Mr. McKnight three times, according to the sheriff.

By TOM VOELK on Publish Date February 2, 2017.  Photo by Martin Campbell.          You know what FOMO is, right? As defined by the Oxford English Dictionary  yes, it is in that dictionary  it is the Fear of Missing Out, angst that something exciting is happening and you are excluded. In other words, it is my social life. Nismo is something else altogether. It stands for Nissan Motorsports, Nissans in-house tuning and performance division. Nismo is sort of what AMG is to Mercedes or M to BMW. For decades, the engineering group at Nissan has done things like prep cars to win multiple titles at 24 Hours of Daytonas, among many other trophies. Put simply, it has cred. If a petite spoiler on your Altima causes you anguish (usually brought on by watching Fast and Furious movies), Nismo can set you straight with a giant wing. And now you can saunter down to a Nissan dealership and buy a Sentra Nismo. Yes, the whole car. In a nutshell, Sentra Nismo begins with the peppy Sentra SR Turbo sedan, then adds a functional aerodynamics package, suspension tuning and a stiffer structure courtesy of a reinforced floor and rear shelf. There is also some faux anodized aluminum and carbon fiber trim in the cockpit along with some deeply bolstered front chairs. Skinny pilots will love them. Larger drivers? Could be FOMO time.

Choose between a six-speed manual and the transmission I drove  a continuously variable unit with simulated manual shifting on the console. No paddle shifters? In a Nismo car?  Continue reading the main story         Advertisement   Continue reading the main story       Ill estimate the 0-60 sprint happens in 7 seconds. The closest competitors, the Ford Fiesta ST and Volkswagen GTI , will win that drag race by a tick or two. At 5,000 r.p.m. theres a distinct whistle from the turbo. When it comes to stopping, the decent brakes are also unchanged from the SR Turbo. That tuned suspension keeps body movements buttoned down while keeping the Nismo more comfortable than one might expect. Of course, low-profile tires on upgraded 18-inch wheels let sharp bumps right on through. Torque steer, a tugging of the steering wheel under hard acceleration that powerful front-drive cars exhibit, is well controlled. The right amount of road and engine noise is allowed into the cockpit, leaving it fine for daily driving. The motor note is on the tame side. The Nismos performance tires cling tenaciously during hard cornering, but the hot Sentra lacks the joy found in a Fiesta GT or GTI when carving curves. The Ford and VW (both with brake torque vectoring) practically beg drivers to charge aggressively into a bend. The Nissan (without it) facilitates the maneuver but doesnt actively encourage it. The continuously variable transmission is a no-cost option that Nissan thinks 60 percent of buyers will grab. Without driving the manual, I have to believe that rowing your own car is far more entertaining to the enthusiasts Nismo is geared toward. Comparing the Nismos variable transmission with the GTIs dual-clutch automatic is like bringing a butter knife to a chain-saw fight. VWs transmission has soul-satisfying rapid-fire action. The Nissans shift dynamic remains slightly rubbery, even though it is revised for Nismo. On specified premium gas, the E.P.A. rates fuel economy of both transmissions at an average of 27 miles per gallon. Thats about the same as GTI and thirstier than Fiesta ST, both of which run on standard fuel. The cabin is simple, with little to distract the driver. If it looks built to a price point, low cost is a prime mission for Sentra. Nismo owners will miss out on auto climate control and a sunroof. The only major option available is a $1,220 premium package that adds a serviceable Bose sound system and navigation to a larger 5.8-inch LCD screen. All Sentras have a fairly roomy back seat. Keep it to two average adults and complaints will be limited to the lack of a rear power port and motion sickness after a hard road romp. The trunk is enormous, holding more than some small crossovers. At $27,075 as tested, the Sentra Nismo is affordable. Comparably equipped, an extra two to three thousand dollars buys the legendary-for-a-reason GTI. For $3,000 less theres the smaller Fiesta ST or Nissans own Sentra SR Turbo with the same motor and brakes. And dont forget the Honda Civic Hatchback Sport, which delivers refinement and spunk for just $22,000.

The car received only an acceptable rating on a test intended to simulate a crash with another vehicle, a tree or a utility pole at 40 miles per hour.   Credit David Paul Morris/Bloomberg     Tesla has long promoted its cars as among the safest available. After its Model S electric sedan was reviewed by the federal governments National Highway Traffic Safety Administration in 2013, Tesla said it had received the best safety rating of any car ever tested. But a more rigorous safety review has reached a different conclusion: that the Tesla S is not on a par with several of its luxury rivals. On Wednesday, the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety , a group known for its strict testing, announced that the Tesla S did not receive either of its safety awards. That was, in part, because in one of five crash tests the dummys head hit the steering wheel. To be a 2017 Top Safety Pick, a vehicle must have good ratings in five crash tests and have an advanced or a superior rating for frontal crash prevention, which includes automatic emergency braking if a collision is imminent. To receive the higher 2017 Top Safety Pick+ designation, a vehicle must meet all those criteria and get an acceptable or good headlight rating, which was added for 2017.

Continue reading the main story         Advertisement   Continue reading the main story       The seatbelt was not tight enough, the institute found, allowing the crash test dummys torso to be thrown so far forward that its head hit the steering wheel through the airbag. The impact was hard enough that it could cause a concussion or facial fractures in a real crash, said David Zuby, the organizations executive vice president and chief research officer. But there was not a high risk of serious injury. The seatbelt force limiter and airbag did not work together quite the way we think is good for this type of crash, he said. The cars headlights were rated poor. The insurance institute did not test the Model Ss forward collision prevention and automatic braking system because it bought the car before Tesla added new hardware and software in October.

This month, federal regulators said they found no defects in the system that caused the crash and that the vehicle did not need to be recalled. On Jan. 23, Tesla made a change to address the head contact issue, Mr. Zuby said. The insurance institute will conduct a new small overlap test and will test the forward collision avoidance system when it receives a new vehicle with the changes. Tesla says its Model S still has the lowest probability of injury of any car ever tested by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. And when the insurance institute gets its new Model S with modifications, Tesla says it expects to receive the highest possible rating in every category, making Model S eligible for the I.I.H.S. Top Safety Pick award. The 2017 Model S was one of two all- electric vehicles the institute tested. The other, the BMW i3, narrowly missed one of the safety awards because its head restraints were rated acceptable, not good. Instead of the Top Safety Pick+ designation going to these two luxury cars, it went to two less-expensive plug-in hybrids, the 2017 Chevrolet Volt and Toyota Prius Prime. Consumers might expect that luxury brand vehicles are safer, and in many cases theyd be right, Mr. Zuby said. But thats not a hard and fast rule.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   The insurance institute recommended that people choose any of the seven other 2017 large luxury models that have fared better than the Model S. The Top Safety Pick+ rating went to the Genesis G90 and G80 models, made by Hyundai, and the Lexus RC. Four rated Top Safety Pick are the Acura RLX, Audi A6 , Infiniti Q70 and Volvo S90 .
