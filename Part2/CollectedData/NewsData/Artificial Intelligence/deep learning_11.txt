Credit Joy Jacobs for The New York Times     The Tony Award-winning actress Renee Elise Goldsberry , 46, is known for her Broadway performances  she played Angelica Schuyler Church in Hamilton and had leading roles in Rent and The Lion King  but she has also been making quite an impression on the small screen. She stars opposite Oprah Winfrey in  The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks  (it will have its premiere on HBO on April 22), and in Netflixs  Altered Carbon , as a rebel leader. Raised in Houston and Bloomfield Hills, Mich., Ms. Goldsberry now lives in New York. Her beauty know-how has been influenced both by her stage roles and by TV makeup artists. Skin Care I wash my face with Cetaphil . Then I moisturize. Im always looking for something that doesnt feel greasy but really works and lasts. Right now Im using the Cetaphil moisturizer for my face, and for my body I use Aveeno . I dont do lip balm. I believe hydration really comes from the inside out, so I try to drink a lot of water. I have children who are always asking for Vaseline on their lips, but Im saying we need to drink more water. Makeup When I was younger, I heard a woman say, I have to put my face on. That kind of disturbed me. I made a decision that I was wearing my face. I didnt want to create something that wasnt there. That sounds great when youre young, but as you get older, you just tend to do more because ... well, maybe you need it. Still, I try to err on the side of less.   Slide Show       Slide Show | 4 Photos  Renee Elise Goldsberrys Beauty Regimen      Renee Elise Goldsberrys Beauty Regimen   Credit Joy Jacobs for The New York Times       If Im meeting someone for breakfast or something, I put on Smashbox Camera-Ready BB cream, which has SPF 15 in it, and Nars blush in Torrid . Once when I was putting on my own makeup for a show at the Apollo, a makeup artist was nearby, and he said, Please, can I just do this? He had a Nars blush, and he totally hooked me up. Then he gave it to me as a gift, and Ive been using it ever since. Maybe Ill do lip gloss. I like nude colors like MAC Oh Baby.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   If I feel like I want to bump it up a little more, like for a work meeting, I add mascara. Typically I use a Revlon one. If Im upgrading from that, like if Im doing my own makeup for the evening, I use MAC Studio Fix Fluid Foundation . I like it because its sheer. I might use lighter colors to contour my lids: Im using a Clinique four-color palette right now. Im trying to look natural and not painted. Im typically fighting hair and makeup teams because Im always saying: Can I wear less? Can I look natural and fresh?  Continue reading the main story         Advertisement   Continue reading the main story       Fragrance I dont wear fragrance. The most fragrant I smell is probably from a St. Ives Body Wash . Its not that I dont like it. I just dont necessarily feel like I need to add a fragrance to myself. Hair I have several different hair products. Im always looking for ones that moisturize. I have things from Nexxus , and theres a shampoo and conditioner from La nza that I found at Rickys. My hair comes to the center of my back. It can get really light in the summer, but I like it to be a rich dark brown. I dont like it when it just blends into my skin. I go to Terence Mathis  I walked into his salon on 45th Street when I moved to New York for The Lion King  and he uses Bigen , which isnt a permanent color. He does all of my coloring and styling. If Im doing my own hair, I like a slicked-back ponytail. I use Giovanni L.A. Natural Styling Gel . It gives a firm hold, and it keeps my edges down. Also, because I wash my hair once a week, its important that its strong enough to work but isnt flaking off the next day.

I live in Harlem and frequent most of the salons here. Ive done acupuncture, and I believe in it. Thats the first place I go if Im having any particular pain anywhere. Diet and Fitness I absolutely pay attention to diet and fitness. When Im in a show or a musical, I think my fight-or-flight instinct kicks in and my metabolism shoots up. I actually have to eat to keep weight on. I personally think women look better with a little weight. The reverse is true when Im not in a show. The first couple of months Im happy because Im seeing a little more weight on; a couple more months later, Im wondering why my jeans arent fitting. The first thing I shot after Hamilton was Henrietta Lacks. I was looking really toned, but Henrietta is a bigger woman than me, so I tried to hide that. Now, in Altered Carbon, Im supposed to be extremely fit and train warriors to save the world. I have a lot of working out to do. My favorite is to run outside. I love the challenge of making it up a hill. But because I have a short amount of time to get ready, Im doing circuit training with a husband-wife team, Marianna Biribin and Josh Viel. They are amazing. But the clock is running down!

The original caption reads: A vendor sold candy floss in Kabul on Tuesday, during festivities celebrating the Afghan New Year. Shah Marai is the photographer. The New York Times published a special dispatch from Afghanistan in March:  Afghan Children, Deprived of School, Tell of Their Deepest Fears . Heres how it begins: When the first day of the new school year starts in Afghanistan on Thursday, 3.7 million boys and girls wont be in attendance, because of increased violence, displacement and poverty. The total number  roughly one in three school-age Afghan children  is expected to grow this year as violence between Afghan forces and the Taliban intensifies, and Pakistan forces Afghan refugees to return home, according to Save the Children, an advocacy group. Read the entire article to hear what five Afghan children had to say, in their own words.  Continue reading the main story        Were interested in your feedback on this page.

Though both groups have tried to leaven their parochialism by adding an international award, it hasnt really changed the overall import, which may be why neither Milan nor Paris has followed suit.  By expanding its purview to include all designers everywhere, the B.F.C. will not only solve this problem, but also expand its potential donor base and guest list, London not having the same tradition of private and corporate philanthropy as, say, the United States. _________   Think you know leaven?

Credit Patrick McHonett     To complement our eighth annual Found Poem Student Contest , we have a thoughtful and detailed Reader Idea from Andrea Avery and Lance Coon , whose students have a long history of submitting some of our favorite entries, including 11 poems last year alone. Do you teach, or learn, with The New York Times? Tell us about it here . ________ Idea: Using The Learning Networks annual Found Poetry Contest as a catalyst for learning about poetry  and the art of assembling this type of poem. Teacher: Ms. Avery, a teacher and the author of the coming Sonata: A Memoir of Pain and the Piano, writes, below, about their work after she and Mr. Coon, fellow English teachers at the Phoenix Country Day School in Arizona, compared notes on how they introduce the contest and what activities they each do around it. School: Phoenix Country Day School Grade Levels: 9-12 Why we chose it: We really cant put this any better than Ms. Avery did herself: I wanted to share with you how we use this great opportunity to reinforce close reading, experimentation, peer review, self-review, revision in our English classes  and writing it out was helpful for me. We will be entering the Found Poetry Contest again this year. Our student winners are thrilled and excited to have been recognized by you. Samantha said that this contest allowed her to feel what its like to have someone like and recognize my work beyond her own local, school, family communities. _________ What Ms. Avery did and why, in her own words   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   I think the first year our students submitted found poems for the contest was 2013, when we were delighted to have three winners and one honorable mention. At that point, I was using it only in my senior elective Art of Composition; now my colleague Lance Coon and I are both using the contest in our classes  he does it with the seniors and I do it with the sophomores.  Continue reading the main story         Advertisement   Continue reading the main story       First, a caveat: Neither Lance nor I is eager to take credit for our students successes. But in the interest of a collegial exchange of ideas with other teachers, we have identified the following items. I also interviewed some of our winning students and have included their input. _________ Class culture and ongoing preparation for found poetry:  Photo        Students Breanna Price and Lindsey Cherilla and teacher Andrea Avery talk about found poems.   Credit Patrick McHonett    Both Lance and I agree that some aspects of our English curriculum over all are quite conducive to the found poetry assignment. Lance points out that our students  especially under his guidance  are adept at close reading of texts and that, throughout the year, he encourages them to look for a juicy image in a text or extract a phrase or sentence and explore its figurative potential. I agree. One of the activities I do with sophomores to encourage close reading of prose is to have students choose a passage from the novel were reading and do a word inventory. I think this lends itself directly to found poetry  and, in fact, a winning student specifically cited this activity as a help. We divide a piece of paper into six sections we call drawers or cubbies: common nouns, proper nouns, verbs, adjectives, figurative language and literal language. Then students inventory literally every word from the passage that fits into the drawer or cubby. This allows them to move past reading the passage for what happens or what it describes to start to see the patterns that are laced into the passage. (For example, lots of color words; verbs that suggest struggle, etc.) This also prepares them to write about the effect of the passage and subtextual elements and helps them get a sense of how many choices writers make to convey not only story or information, but also connotation, mood and tone. Samantha Dady (a 2016 runner-up for Her Mirror) said she used this technique once she had located news articles she was interested in, so that she could find common themes or tensions between the articles. Here is her poem , which is based on this article and this one .   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   A second aspect of ongoing class culture that prepares students for found poetry is our use of in-class journals. My students write for the first eight minutes of every class, often on a prompt, though they are always free to write whatever they want. Prompts are often stolen pieces of dialogue, or lines from poetry, or just funny words. This activity prepares students to play with language out of context and to imagine new scenarios for nuggets of words. _________ Introducing and preparing the lesson:  Photo        Sally Tepper works on a blackout version of a found poem.   Credit Patrick McHonett    After introducing the contest and its specifications, Lance and I both ask students to write found poems that dont follow the rules of the contest, as these early attempts wont be submitted. Lance encourages students to look anywhere, including using the classroom as a potential text. He points out that a student once used titles of files on his computer for a found poem! Ive had students use schoolwide email messages. During this play phase of the lesson, we encourage students to consider the idea of the twist or the tension between the found poem and its source (I find that sophomores love this idea). We talk about borrowing words from a text and creating something that disagrees with or contradicts the text. A student complaining about how boring his chemistry book was decided to steal words from it and create a product that was exciting, magical, thrilling. Several students chose words from political candidates websites to try to extract text that they could rearrange to express an opponents viewpoint. One used words from Microsofts website to write an ad for Apple. We also do, per the suggestion from the Learning Network site, blackout poems : One of our winners, Breanna Price (Black Magic), said that looking at other examples of found poetry in class and trying blackout poetry gave me a lot of inspiration for my own found poem. Here is Breannas poem , with links to the articles she used. _________ Three activity ideas for found poems: A. Skyes Stereoscope During a daily journal session in which I had handed every student a picture torn from a magazine to use as inspiration, one student had the brilliant idea to toggle back and forth between the images on each side of the magazine page, writing one sentence or phrase at a time for each picture and assembling them into a poem made up of lines drawn alternatingly from reverse images. This idea belongs to sophomore Skye Richmond, and I am totally going to try it with another group during the found poem unit, perhaps with some modification. I think of this as the Skyes Stereoscope exercise, because it reminds me of those old stereoscopes , or even View-Masters , in which multiple images merge to form a 3D image. B. BananaPoems I have a group of kids who come to my room at lunchtime on Fridays to play board games, and a favorite of ours is Bananagrams . It occurred to me that an activity I plan to do this month to introduce or practice found poems is as follows:  I will place on the work surface many snippets of language  words, phrases, etc., on small pieces of paper  including and, the, of, etc.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story    Students will be instructed to take a set number of snippets  say, 15  and begin making a poem.  From there, it follows the rules of Bananagrams (i.e., a person who gets it all to work says peel and everyone takes a new snippet to integrate; a player can dump a snippet in exchange for three more, etc.).  At the end, we will read and appreciate one anothers poems and/or offer suggestions to one another. C. Visible Listening This is an activity that I have done with students in our short story unit, but that I think prepares us well for poetry in general and found poems in particular. We listen to short stories read aloud. To encourage students to listen closely, I provide each with a piece of poster board and many markers. As we listen, students are asked to make their listening visible by pulling out words, images, etc., and/or by writing down their reactions. The result is a set of posters that, alone and in aggregate, depict what students were hearing  and allow us to trace patterns of imagery or to linger on and discuss phrases or words that students collected. Its sort of like a low-tech word cloud.  Photo        This is an example of Bellas (10th grade) Visible Listening products for the Raymond Carver story Cathedral.   Credit Patrick McHonett    _________ Composing our found poems: Lance and I both allow students to create their poems in class  and, crucially I think, we both make found poems right alongside our students. Lance takes this one brilliant step further. He uses his Smart Board to display his work on his poem. So hell paste chunks of text up there and then, as kids are working on their own, he moves his around  so students can look up from their process and watch another poets process in action, in real time. I am stealing this idea next year.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   One of the winners, Olivia Najafi ( Keep ) said that what really resonated with her was the advice to let the poem write itself, meaning dont force any type of theme or idea. We encourage our students to start with articles or topics theyre interested in, of course, and then (per Samanthas comment) start moving away from what the article is about to what good, borrowable, twistable language is in there. _________ Workshop, peer review, teacher feedback, revision:  Photo        Brennan Freret listens as Sally Tepper shares a found poem.   Credit Patrick McHonett    Lance uses his Smart Board to great effect here, too  though any regular classroom projector would do. He projects a students found poem draft on the screen and then guides the group through a peer review. One of the prompts he might use is Do the lines follow one another? He also emphasizes wringing out the poem: The group helps the poet cut anything that isnt earning its place on the page. Students point out words that could go, or lines that seem to retain too much prosiness. I use one-on-one consultations with students that follow what I call a recitation-observation-intention-revision format. When a student brings me her poem, I read it aloud to her, and then I ask, Anything you noticed as I read that? Then I continue the conversation by sharing an observation about the poem and asking the student about the intention behind it. With Samanthas poem, for example, I noticed something going on with the capitalizing of pronouns, but I didnt understand it. So I asked her to explain her intention, and then I pointed out my confusion, and then she came up with a solution. I might also make an observation like, I see many more words in Stanzas 1 and 2 and very few in Stanza 3  why did you make that choice? Some students seek out a friend to help them decide what lines can go (again, the emphasis is on help me trim things away from this, not what can I add?). I think Lance and I both tread pretty lightly on our students poems  we dont, for example, require them to turn in a draft for feedback before they submit to the contest. We dont, as a default, mark up our students poems. I think this might actually be something that is partly responsible for our high number of student winners: The work is truly theirs, and true to them. The poems arent too managed. We try to show them the habits and practices of self- and peer review and give them the space to do it. Or not.   I wanted to share with you how we use this great opportunity to reinforce close reading, experimentation, peer-review, self-review, revision in our English classes  and writing it out was helpful for me. We will be entering the Found Poetry Contest again this year. Our student winners are thrilled and excited to have been recognized by you. Samantha said that this contest allowed her to feel what its like to have someone like and recognize my work beyond her own local, school, family communities.

Participating is easy: Just find some poetry in a Times article  any Times article, published at any point in our 165-year history. To help, this year we also have a companion lesson plan by two teachers who use this contest to reinforce close reading, experimentation, peer-review, self-review and revision"  skills that are valuable across the curriclum. And, if that isnt enough, we also just published an additional 21 ways to teach poetry with The New York Times . Everything you need to know about the contest is below, with links and tips galore. But if you have any questions, please post them in the comments, and we will answer you there.

Credit European Space Agency/NASA    Q. Whats a found poem? A. A good nutshell description would be poems that are composed from words and phrases found in another text. A New York Times found poem, then, uses words and phrases taken from one or more Times articles, past or present  and since the paper has been publishing since 1851, choosing which Times article(s) to use is often the hardest part.  Continue reading the main story         Advertisement   Continue reading the main story       You can mix and combine these words and phrases into a new piece, or you might simply find some Times writing that you think is already poetic, as Alan Feuer has done with Craigslist and its Missed Connections posts . For more detail about found poetry and its history and classroom uses, we suggest an article from English Journal, Found Poems and Headline Poems. (PDF) Q.  What are the guidelines for this challenge? A.  Each poem must be 14 or fewer lines.  You may give it your own original title if you like. The title does not count as one of the lines.  Your sole source material must be Times pieces. You can use up to two articles.  The poem itself should use no more than two of your own words. The rest of the words and phrases can be mixed up any way you like, but should all come from The Times. (You may repeat words from the articles as many times as you like.)  You might choose to write in a traditional poetic form , or not.  Poems may be submitted by groups or by individuals. Only one poem per person is allowed, however.  You must be from 13 to 19 years old but can be from anywhere in the world.  You must post your poem as a comment on this page by 7 a.m. Eastern time on May 9.  At the bottom of your found-poem post, please provide us with the URL(s) of the article(s) you used.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story    Though The Learning Network often publishes excerpts from literary and historical works on our blog via our Text to Text and Poetry Pairing features, those are off limits for this contest. The Times articles they are paired with are, of course, fair game Note: Our commenting system doesnt recognize fancy spacing, so using words to create interesting shapes is, unfortunately, not an option. Q. What makes a great found poem? A. Scroll through the work of all the students who have won so far . As we note year after year , the poems that stand out always do two things well: They show a real love of, and care with, language, and they honor the Times source material in interesting and creative ways. Remember that in a poem, every word, line break and mark of punctuation carries meaning, so have fun experimenting with repetition of words, alliteration, assonance or anything else that enhances what you would like to say. This related lesson plan , written by two teachers whose students regularly submit to our contest and win, might also help. Finally, here is an interactive tool you might use to play with the words of your poem before you submit it: ReadWriteThinks Word Mover.  Photo        An image of The New York Times's obituary for famed poet Walt Whitman, which inspired this poem.    Q. How do I find a focus for my poem with the entire New York Times to choose from? A. Its true you can choose any Times piece ever published for this challenge, and one of our favorites the first year used an article from 1892. But the nine others we liked best that year chose much more recent work, and thats fine, too. Your poem can be on any topic or theme. It can be about something as broad as science in general or as specific as scientific observation of the relationship between a badger and a cow .   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   It can focus on something currently in the news , or you can use the Times archives or On This Day to write about the past. You can explore a trend youve read about in The Times, or you might simply collect words and phrases from different articles around a theme like identity, loss or joy. Q. How and when do I post my poem? A. Between today, April 5, and Tuesday, May 9 by 7 a.m. Eastern time , post your poem as a comment on this post. Q. How do I participate if I dont have a digital subscription to NYTimes.com? A. The Timess digital subscription system gives readers free access to 10 articles each month. If you exceed that limit, you will be asked to become a digital subscriber. One thing you should know, however, is that The Learning Network and all its posts for students, as well as all Times articles linked from them, are accessible without a digital subscription. That means that if you use any of the articles we have linked to here  with the exception of our lesson plans for teachers  they will not count as part of the 10-article limit. In addition, keep in mind that you need only one great Times article to create a great found poem.  Photo        Hana Abdullah left her home in Mabrouka, a small Syrian town, then lived with her extended family in a makeshift tent settlement in Lebanons Bekaa Valley. Related Article | Related Student Poem   Credit Lynsey Addario for The New York Times    Q. Im not an English teacher. Can this exercise help me address the standards in my subject area? A. Yes! The process of creating a found poem entails closely reading sophisticated nonfiction writing in order to first identify salient words and details, then recombine those words to create something that summarizes, reacts to or comments on the topic. So, if youre studying climate change in your science classroom, for example, having students work with one or more articles from the related Times Topics page can be a creative way of having them determine central ideas or themes of a text and analyze their development and summarize the key supporting details and ideas or analyze how two or more texts address similar themes or topics.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   Creating the poem itself, by deciding what to say and how to say it, might then satisfy, say, the Common Core standard that asks that students apply knowledge of language to understand how language functions in different contexts, to make effective choices for meaning or style. Every year we get many science-themed poems, on topics from the God particle to fruit flies, the human brain to the cosmos . And judging by the many history-themed poems we receive every year, social studies teachers need little convincing that the contest can be a useful way to spur close reading of primary sources. For instance, last year a winning poet used materials from 1941 and 1945 to write verse about World War II . 2012 was the 100th anniversary of the sinking of the Titanic, and that year we received many poems that used both historic and current Times reporting on the event . And, of course, every year a majority of the work we get is current-events-focused, on topics from the Syrian refugee crisis to the Boston Marathon bombing, so participating in the contest is a way of helping your students understand news that is important to them. Here are some past lesson plans in which weve suggested found-poem exercises: Words of War: Comparing Veterans Experiences With War Poetry Hes the Bomb: Learning About the Creation and Detonation of the Atom Bomb in 1945   The Dream Continued: Creating Found Poems From Martin Luther King Jr.s New York Times Obituary Campus Catastrophe: Writing Found Poetry to Respond to the Virginia Tech Tragedy Good luck, and please post your poems and any questions you might have in the comments.

Credit Benjamin Norman for The New York Times     Compare the painting pictured above, Open Casket by Dana Schutz, with the one below, The Times Thay Aint a Changing Fast Enough! by Henry Taylor. Describe what you see. How is the subject matter depicted  is it realistic, surreal, abstract? Which of these paintings do you find more graphic? Why? Can you think of any artwork that has been banned, including books, paintings, music, movies or television? What was banned, and why?  Photo        Henry Taylors The Times Thay Aint a Changing Fast Enough!, part of the Whitney Biennial.   Credit Philip Greenberg for The New York Times    In  Should Art That Infuriates Be Removed? , Roberta Smith writes: We all encounter art we dont like, that upsets and infuriates us. This doesnt deserve to be exhibited, our brains yell; it should not be allowed to exist. Still, does such aversion mean that an artwork must be removed from view  or, worse, destroyed?  This question has been at the heart of the controversy that has split the art world since the Whitney Biennial opened nearly two weeks ago. The turmoil, which has been excruciating for many people in different ways, centers on Open Casket, a painting in the exhibition by Dana Schutz. The work is based partly on photographs of the horrifically mutilated face of Emmett Till lying in his coffin in 1955, about 10 days after that African-American 14-year-old was brutally killed by two white men in Mississippi for supposedly flirting with a white store clerk. The artist, Ms. Schutz, is white, and her use of the images has struck many in the art world as an inappropriate appropriation that, they argue, should be removed.  The first protest was solo: The day the exhibition opened an African-American artist, Parker Bright, stood in front of it wearing a T-shirt with Black Death Spectacle handwritten on its back, sometimes partly blocking the view, sometimes engaging others in conversation. A photograph of Mr. Bright at the Whitney was posted on Twitter:  Objections to the painting went viral with an open letter from Hannah Black, a British-born writer and artist who lives in Berlin, co-signed by others, charging that the Till image was black subject matter, off limits to a white artist. Ms. Black belittled the Schutz painting as exploiting black suffering for profit and fun and demanded that it be not only removed from the exhibition but also destroyed. Students: Read the entire article, then tell us:  Are there any topics or subjects that should be out of bounds for an artist? Why or why not?  Does an artists race, ethnicity, religion or gender matter when she or he creates art about a subject about a different identity group? Consider examples from the article and others not mentioned.

Who owns that? What do you think?  Continue reading the main story         Advertisement   Continue reading the main story        In light of the quote above, consider the history of Jim Crow, segregation in northern cities, and the Civil Rights Movement and its successes, shortcomings and role in American history. How should Americans reckon with and understand this history? Does any group own this history? Which group, or neither, and why?   The warm-up activity and the questions above came from Brian Hussey, an AP U.S. history and American studies facilitator at New Tech High @ Coppell , in Coppell, Texas. Mr. Hussey wrote to us at The Learning Network to say he has used the site frequently, in both his current school and previously, at a charter school in North Philadelphia. His students recently used this New York Times article to discuss ownership of history in their six-week Civil Rights Movement unit. Students 13 and older are invited to comment.

How old were they when they remembered their earliest memory? And how old were they when the remembered event took place? In  Recalling Early Childhood Memories, or Not , C. Claiborne Ray writes: Q. When four of us shared memories of our very young lives, not one of us could recall events before the age of 4 or possibly 3. Is this common?  A. Yes. For adults, remembering events only after age 312 or 4 is typical, studies have found . The phenomenon was named childhood amnesia by Freud and identified late in the 19th century by the pioneering French researcher Victor Henri and his wife, Catherine.  The Henris published a questionnaire on early memories in 1895, and the results from 123 people were published in 1897. Most of the participants earliest memories came from when they were 2 to 4 years old; the average was age 3. Very few participants recalled events from the first year of life. Many subsequent studies found similar results. Students: Read the entire article, then tell us:  Do you agree with the research that suggests the formation of childrens earliest memories are linked to when they begin talking about past events with a parent? Why or why not?  Do you have any early memories? What are they? Did someone else confirm the memory, or do you have a photograph of it? How do you know it actually happened and wasnt just a dream?    How old were you when you remembered your earliest memory? And how old were you when the remembered event took place? What details do you recall? Students 13 and older are invited to comment.

Do you ever worry youll let people down? Have you ever felt pressured by them when it comes to making big decisions, such as where to go to college, what to study, what jobs you should pursue, and so on? In the On Campus column  Finding Growth at My Historically Black College , Skylar Mitchell, a sophomore at Spelman College, writes: I wasnt interested in Spelman when I first visited. I was in the eighth grade and my heart was set on the Northeast Ivies. I knew I wanted extensive study-abroad options, a core curriculum and at least a 10 percent black student population. That last item was nonnegotiable.  That year during spring break, my mom took my brother and me to Atlanta to sightsee. Your nana would want you to see this school, my mom said as we pulled up to Spelmans gate. You dont have to go, but you are going to see it.  My parents shared premium on education bonded them as graduate students at the University of Southern California in the 1990s. Two New Yorkers pursuing their masters and doctorates, they saw school as the surest way to attain security. It was never a question that I was going to college. Hard work, I was taught, would ensure as many choices as possible.  That level of pressure was the norm in Montgomery County, Md., just outside Washington, D.C., where I grew up. It is one of the wealthiest and best-educated counties in the country. It is also largely segregated and fiercely competitive. I grew up surrounded by so much privilege it was possible for many residents to ignore race and class inequality entirely. After all, the nations first black president lived 12 miles away. So, despite the racial violence that was making headlines, my friends seemed to believe Montgomery County was post-racial. Students: Read the entire column, then tell us:  To what degree, if at all, do you identify with Ms. Mitchells experience of her college search or the influence other people have had on important decisions she has made?  Do you feel pressure to achieve? If so, is it you trying to attain certain things? Or does it come from family, peers, teachers, your community or others? Explain.  Do you have expectations placed on you because of what your parents, siblings or extended family members have achieved in their own lives? If so, how have you responded to those expectations?    In her writing, Ms. Mitchell talks about how her peers reacted when she told them she would attend Spelman. What do you think about that? Have you ever been on the receiving end of judgment commentary about a decision you made? How did you deal with it? Students 13 and older are invited to comment.
