She was less than halfway through her allotted airtime. At 35, Ms. OBanion, a founder of Beauty Bioscience in Dallas, was clearly an effective advertisement for her product: the $199 GloPro, a hand-held device for at-home microneedling  that is, using teeny tiny surgical steel needles to prod the skin into increasing production of collagen and elastin, and as a result improving texture and tone and potentially reducing wrinkles and scars. In those 12 minutes, Ms. OBanion sold 22,000 units (some $4 million worth), according to company figures. In the roughly eight months of 2016 the device was available  at HSN, the shopping network, and also at Neiman Marcus and Bergdorf Goodman later on  about $30 million worth were sold. HSN does not release sales figures, but Alicia Valencia, the networks senior vice president for beauty, said that GloPro, which looks like a miniature needle-studded paint roller, was the top performing tool. It is also the top-selling beauty tool at Neiman Marcus. Beautys New Cult Device, Womens Wear Daily declared . (GloPro is not the only at-home microneedling device  there are several, and with varying needle lengths  but it is the one attracting the most attention.)

Almost immediate tightening of the pores, the lines around my eyes softened, and the lines around my mouth are almost gone.  Continue reading the main story         Advertisement   Continue reading the main story       Ms. Savich, who said her closets overflow with useless high-end beauty products, added, After about 45 years of looking, you know when youve found something good.   Microneedling: Good to Know           Tina Craig, a founder of the popular Bagsnob blog empire, reported that during New York Fashion Week people kept asking her what she was doing to her skin. It looked amazing and glowy, said Ms. Craig, who had just begun using the GloPro. (Asked to rank the device on a suffering-for-beauty scale, Ms. Craig, who says she is so sensitive that she has to comb out her own hair at the beauty salon, said the pain was less than waxing but more than threading.) Wounding the skin  by chemical peel, dermabrasion or laser, for example  has traditionally been the only way to jump-start collagen production and rejuvenation, and that sort of injury to the epidermis can be inflicted only very occasionally. But microneedling, sometimes called the poor mans laser, has fewer limitations, said Dr. Terry James, a dermatologist, founder of Beauty Bioscience and Ms. OBanions father. The process creates tiny microwounds that trigger the body to fill them with collagen, but leave the epidermis intact, said Dr. S. Tyler Hollmig, an assistant professor of dermatologic surgery at Stanford. That gives microneedling two advantages: One, it can be repeated often, without producing the red, irritated, unsightly skin of, say, a peel, Dr. James said. And two, it has a lower risk of causing hyperpigmentation as compared to many lasers, a real advantage for minority skin types, Dr. Hollmig said. A study funded by Beauty Bioscience and conducted by an independent company found almost-too-good-to-be-true results: a 30 percent reduction in wrinkles among women ages 41 to 64 with just a minute of use, three times a week, for 30 days. (The tool, which has 540 0.3-millimeter needles, is rolled vertically, horizontally and diagonally across the face, as though the user is aerating a lawn.) Microneedling done in a doctors office has shown some compelling evidence in smaller studies that it works, though there havent been a lot of large, randomized control trials, which is the gold standard, Dr. Hollmig said.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   But home microneedling devices have shorter needles than those used by doctors and spas, which might suggest that results will not be as good. Dr. Hollmig theorized that collagen production, for example, would be minimal with such a conservative treatment. Dr. James, however, pointed to a study published in the journal Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery showing that collagen formation isnt dependent on needle length and that best results occur with regular microneedling.

If you think about exercising, she said, is it better to go to the gym twice a year and lift a 20-pound weight for two hours, or is it better to be doing something smaller and going often? Dr. Mathew Avram, director of the Dermatology Laser and Cosmetic Center at Massachusetts General Hospital, suggested the results may be real but fleeting. When you roll something on your skin that creates little holes, you may get a little bit of swelling, which would give you a bit of plumping and make you think you look better temporarily, said Dr. Avram, who was skeptical about the tools long-term benefits. Theres a real need for data to justify the excitement. GloPro also promotes the fact that 100 percent of its users, when surveyed, thought the tool stimulated their natural collagen production, though collagen formation is visible only under a microscope. Beauty Bioscience says it took it four years to find the right number of needles, which were tested in 10-needle increments from 100 to 800, seeking the best effect with the leastpain. (Think of microneedling as a circus act where someone walks across a bed of nails without bleeding: Its all about the even distribution of weight.) A GloPro head designed for use on the body, with 1,680 needles, was introduced in December; it sold out immediately and was back-ordered until mid-January. There is a small risk of infection with the device, especially if you roll it through an infected hair follicle or what dermatologists call a scratched acne lesion. Alcohol, the suggested means of cleaning the tool, doesnt do the job for many surgical instruments, as certain bacteria (like those causing outbreaks now and again at nail salons) arent eliminated without really vigorous sterilization. (Short of buying a personal autoclave, there isnt much you can do.) Another potential problem: GloPro speaks of its ability to make your skin absorb more product, but your chances of having an allergic reaction to said product may be higher, though still relatively rare. In microneedling done in spas, for example, there have been reports of whats called delayed hypersensitivity reactions  that is, nasty skin rashes  caused by the creams applied afterward. Normally, the outer layer of skin would prevent the creams from sinking deeply enough to cause a problem, but microneedling enables them to reach deeper, and set off an immune response. The flip side is that microneedling may be able to assist a user in getting all sorts of potentially helpful stuff into the skin. This is pretty exciting, but is a little too close to the Wild West right now for this dermatologist to be feel completely comfortable, Dr. Hollmig said.   Correction: March 2, 2017   The Skin Deep column on Feb. 23, about an at-home device that minimizes wrinkles, misstated the value of 22,000 GloPro units. At $199 each, they are worth more than $4 million, not $400,000.

Hesitantly, he said, Maybe there are special places in the world that have universal human appeal. I felt a similar, uncanny rush when I noticed that, at some point while he talked, we had each instinctually taken a seat on the rock ledge, next to the hashtag, and were now sitting side by side, staring into space where the two ancient campfires once burned.  Its not an especially spiritual experience when one human being walks into another human beings kitchen for the first time and simply knows where the silverware drawer is. At the back of Gorhams, though, that intuition was spread across two distinct kinds of humans and tens of thousands of years. Ultimately, why we are here and the Neanderthals are not can no longer be explained in a way that implies that our existence is particularly meaningful or secure. But at least moments like this placed our existence inside some longer, less-conditional-seeming continuity. _________   Think you know uncanny?

Some basic tenets: Dont admit fault, dont admit that you got played, dont give any credence to the inner narrative that might complicate the outer one.  There are a few songs like that on SweetSexySavage, the first major label album from Kehlani, the Oakland, Calif., R&B singer who, over the course of two self-released albums, has emerged as an idiosyncratic lyricist with discernible swagger. But the most striking moments on this refreshingly warm LP are the others, the ones where she conveys weakness, vulnerability and self-awareness. _________   Think you know credence?

Chinese-built subway cars will soon appear in Chicago and Boston, Beijing is building a $5 billion high-speed rail line in Indonesia, and the Chinese government recently christened new rail freight service between London and Beijing. Another ambitious system in the works, the 2,400-mile Pan-Asia Railway Network, would link China to Laos, Thailand and Singapore.  But few places are being reshaped by Chinas overseas juggernaut like Africa, a continent that has seen relatively little new railroad construction in a century.  Despite years of steady economic growth, sub-Saharan Africa remains hobbled by an infrastructure deficit, according to the Africa Development Bank, with only half of its roads paved and nearly 600 million people lacking access to electricity.  Chinese companies, many of them state-owned and grappling with an economic slowdown at home, have stepped unto the breach, earning about $50 billion a year on new ports, highways and airports across the continent, according to the China Africa Research Initiative at Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies. _________   Think you know juggernaut?

Grade Level : Grades 9-12 _________  Photo         Credit Kobie Mathies    What Ms. Fogel-Shrive Did, and Why, in Her Own Words My teaching idea originally came from the October 2013 New York Times Sunday Review article,  My Selfie, Myself , and the Learning Network post,  Why Do We Take Selfies?  The focus on the selfie phenomenon, including todays Instagram and Snapchat applications, is a subject that can provide a bridge in the high school classroom, as students express themselves and share their chosen selfie persona with their fellow classmates and their classroom teacher.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   As a way to connect with my students at the beginning of the school year, and additionally to provide an engaging topic for a pretest writing assignment as a diagnostic tool for assessment, I found the selfie reading selection to be a perfect springboard for close reading of a complex text. Students, accustomed to school policy on keeping their phones in their backpacks, were certainly surprised and eager to be requested by me to take out your phones, take a selfie and send it to me!  Continue reading the main story         Advertisement   Continue reading the main story       While some students did not have access at the time (wireless and equipment challenges), and some wanted more time to prepare for their close-up, this prereading activity was captivating and enjoyable for students. Students background knowledge on the subject was acknowledged, and the article and questions posed provided the opportunity for rich discussion, entering the conversation, and connection to the writing task. Questions posed and then incorporated in a quickwrite were based on those in the Learning Network post, Why Do We Take Selfies? They included:  How often do you take selfies  pictures of yourself  with your cellphone camera and send them to someone, or post them on social media?  What kind do you take, and what reactions do you usually get?  Why do you think there has been such an increase in this kind of picture-taking in recent years? We then read the entire article over a period of a few days, while I printed and created a bulletin board of their selfies as they were sent to me. This display was maintained all year, and provided a forum of self-expression and classroom collaboration. Students discussed key concepts of the selfie phenomenon and responded to the following questions for their writing task:  Why do we take selfies? How does the selfie differ from a photograph taken by another, and what does this tell us about ourselves and our society?  Is taking selfies about vanity, about trying to understand how others see you, or about something else? Why do you think people take and share them?  Do you agree with the person quoted who says, The idea of the selfie is much more like your face is the caption and youre trying to explain a moment or tell a story? Why or why not?   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story    Do you agree or disagree with the closing statement that selfies can sometimes be a kind of visual diary?  Is the proliferation of selfies changing the way we have online conversations and interactions? How?  Photo         Credit Kayla Van Horn    Assessment The culminating assignment was a writing diagnostic utilized as a springboard for literacy and writing instruction across curriculums. A norming and scoring session was held after school with the teachers of core classes joining forces to analyze and determine student proficiency based on the California State University (CSU) English Placement Test (EPT) scoring guide. Teachers reviewed and discussed their observations, with an emphasis on content literacy, equity and Common Core State Standards. For my current ninth- and 11th-grade English classes, I plan to include the questioning strategy SOAPSTone (Subject, Occasion, Audience, Purpose, Speaker, Tone) into the above lessons after a first or second read of the article. Well pay particular attention to the O (Occasion), which can sometimes be a challenge, but here can be discerned in the authors introduction. SOAPSTone provides analysis of an expository text and supports the writing process. It can also be used as a formative assessment for the teacher, to determine whether students are understanding the text in its rhetorical context. The SOAPSTone strategy is an academic approach recommended by AP Central (The College Board), as well as the California State Universitys Expository Reading and Writing Curriculum (CSU ERWC), designed for postsecondary success. _________ Related Student Opinion | How Real Are You on Social Media?

The idea below explains how Paulette DeRito uses three different Times features to incorporate persuasive writing, science and math in the E.L.L. classroom. Do you teach, or learn, with The New York Times? Tell us about it here . _________ Idea: English language learners in an elementary school use Times restaurant reviews, ScienceTake videos and the Science Q. and A. feature to practice writing, learn science and solve math problems. Teacher: Paulette DeRito is an English Learner Specialist at the Barlow Mountain School , Ridgefield, Conn. Grade Level: 2, 3, 4, 5 (high-level English language learners) Why We Chose It: We appreciate Ms. DeRitos ability to home in on short Times videos, restaurant reviews and science articles to use with elementary students who are learning English and create a curriculum that inspires wonder, reminds students of their home country and culture and capitalizes on their curiosity about the world around them.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   _________  Photo         Credit Christopher Gregory for The New York Times    What Ms. DeRito Did and Why, in Her Words Persuasive Writing Idea: Use a New York Times restaurant review that relates to students (or their parents) countries of origin as the basis for a one-page persuasive argument about why the restaurant would be worth a visit.  Continue reading the main story         Advertisement   Continue reading the main story       The restaurant review we used was  Russian Dumplings, Like Grandmas, at Two Village Spots , which tells about a Russian food cart and a Ukrainian restaurant. These were of interest to my student from Belarus, as the owner of the food cart is also from Belarus. In this case, the students understanding of English made him able to understand the review as I read it aloud to him. The details of the food items were all familiar to him also. This is an excellent way to pay tribute to the country where a student is from. There are many restaurant reviews which can be searched by cuisine, thereby tailoring the activity to a students country of origin or food that is familiar. What We Did 1. We talked about local places to eat in our town, and which ones we like and why we like them. We discussed different ways a restaurant owner can get people to come to the restaurant and wrote them on sticky notes: Advertise in a newspaper; offer a coupon for a free meal; post specials or photographs of the food on social media; foster word of mouth (for my students, this concept needed to be explained); and, finally, try to get reviews of the restaurant in a newspaper, online, or on a site like Yelp . 2. We then discussed what a person could potentially learn from reading a review: the restaurants name and location, the type of food served, the reviews opinion about the quality of the food, a description of the dining room, how casual or formal it is. 3. Next, I read the review to my student, making note of difficult words, which he then used context clues to figure out the meanings. 4. We reread the review, this time focusing on the restaurant information at the conclusion of the article: the address, the restaurant website, the recommended dishes, the price symbols and what they stand for, when its open, whether the restaurant takes reservations or can accommodate a person with a wheelchair, and how easy it is to find a parking spot. Writing Activity Write a one-page persuasive essay telling your family why you should visit this restaurant or food cart. Remember to explain what type of food is offered, how long it might take to get there from home, and why you think they would like it. Write about the prices of the food, and the dishes you think would be good to try. Remember, you have to convince them that its worth the trip! _________  Video   ScienceTake | Building a Rescue Roach    Cockroaches move so well through small spaces that they make good models for robots to find survivors in collapsed buildings.  By DAVID FRANK and JAMES GORMAN on Publish Date February 8, 2016.  .  Watch in Times Video          embed            Science Idea: Use a New York Times Science video to learn about how the behavior of bugs can help scientists build a robot.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   James Gormans science videos and related articles inspire many activities, yielding new vocabulary words and thought-provoking discussions. Because of their short length, the videos work well with younger students. (Also note: There is always an advertisement first.) In about two minutes, students can learn something very interesting. In particular, the video  Building a Rescue Roach  helps students understand how science can help us. As they will learn, by studying how cockroaches can fit themselves into small spaces, scientists can build a rescue robot to help victims trapped in a collapsed building or to help gather information after a disaster. What We Did 1. Discussed what we already knew  or thought we knew  about cockroaches: They are dirty, they run away when you turn the lights on, they tend to live in crowded cities. 2. Listed describing words for cockroaches: slimy, ugly, dirty, creepy. 3. Looked at the photo of the rescue roach (shown above) and talked about what was going on in the image. 4. Watched the video about how cockroaches can be used to help scientists build a robot that can fit into small spaces. 5. Discussed whether it is right to use bugs to help us. Luckily, Mr. Gorman explained that the roaches were not harmed during the flattening. Questions for Students 1. What is the order of the steps the scientists took to test the roaches? 2. What were the results of the research? 3. Why do you think the scientists used roaches? Why didnt they use other bugs? 4. Do you think its right that the scientists tried to flatten the roaches? Is it fair to use insects to help us? (This can lead to a good discussion about animal testing and animal rights.)   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   _________  Photo         Credit Victoria Roberts    Math Idea: Use information in a Science Q. and A. article to make bar graphs. We used  How Many Eggs Does a Chicken Lay in Its Lifetime ? for this activity. What We Did: 1. We wrote down everything we know about hens, and then I asked these questions: Did you know there are different types of hens? Did you ever wonder how many eggs a chicken lays in its lifetime? Do you think chickens make good pets? Why or why not? Where can you find hens? 2. After we read the article , we discussed how important it is to wonder about things and how this can help you become a good researcher. 3. Students used the figure 276 eggs per year to create bar graphs that show weekly egg production for a month and monthly egg production for a year. _________ Related: Our full collection for English language learners .

The idea below explains how Cynthia McCallister and Kate Louis use Metropolitan Diary to inspire students to write stories about life in their communities. Do you teach, or learn, with The New York Times? Tell us about it here. ________ Idea : Using Metropolitan Diary to teach high school narrative writing, and to help students become more democratically oriented citizens. Teachers : Cynthia McCallister is an associate professor of literacy and English education at New York University and the creator of the Learning Cultures curriculum model. Kate Louis is an English teacher at Urban Assembly High School for Green Careers, on Manhattans Upper West Side. Grade Levels : 9-12 Why We Chose It : Because Metropolitan Diary is a beloved feature of The New York Times, and because it lends itself to inspiring personal writing across a wide span of grade levels, skills and interests.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   ________ What Ms. McCallister Did and Why, in Her Own Words Im a teacher educator and curriculum designer who works with teachers and children in New York City K-12 public schools to improve curriculum and instruction in ways that support engagement and achievement. In my role as a coach in schools, some of what I do is show teachers and students how to master written language as a system of tools that can be used to achieve their own intentions and purposes. I also show students and teachers how to open up the curriculum to let students practice being a citizen in a free democracy through opportunities to share with one another the creative products of their own intellects.  Continue reading the main story         Advertisement   Continue reading the main story       Some of the most interesting text forms that I have shared with students have been culled from our own local newspaper, The New York Times. In New York City and around the world, The Times greases the wheels of democratic discourse. Its chock-full of stories in an almost infinitely creative presentation of forms. And one that students always seem to love the best is The Timess Metropolitan Diary. For 40 years Metropolitan Diary has been entertaining New Yorkers by providing a space for them to tell stories about themselves to each other, holding up a mirror to see reflections of irony and beauty, and all sorts of flecks in the kaleidoscope of our cultural character. This is one of my all-time favorites, about Dunkin Donuts, from March 1, 2009 : DEAR DIARY:  (This is a true story; it took place in Sheepshead Bay this winter.)  In Dunkin Donuts this morning, an old lady wearing a tattered watch cap started speaking to no one in particular.  I cant sleep at night. I have pains in my chest all the time. My leg hurts and my children do not love me.  People waiting in line hid in their cellphones, looked away or stared straight ahead.  I dont know what to do. I dont know where to turn. My husband died two years ago on the 27th.  Everyone pretended she wasnt there. The girls behind the counter took the next customers. The line inched forward.  At a side table, a beautiful young lady with matching purple scarf and hat looked at the old woman and said, simply, Honey, please sit down with me, and tell me your story.  Its possible, you see, for one person to save the world.  Mel Glenn Metropolitan Diary can provide an inspirational vehicle for students to tell their own stories about life in their hometown. The philosopher John Dewey wrote that democracy is a form of associated living  living in connection with other people, and having those connections be the fabric of society. Students can use Metropolitan Diary and other text forms from The New York Times to inspire their personal writing and to help them become more self-possessed as writers and more democratically oriented as citizens of our world.

Related Metropolitan Diary   Credit Librado Romero/The New York Times    The Writing Process We Use In most writing classrooms, teachers normally have to follow curriculum programs that dictate units of study. They assign students spaces to sit, and restrict whom they talk to so theyll get their work done. Shared interests are restricted by the limitations of the curriculum, and the interplay of forms of association are anything but free. These kinds of practices teach an ethos of suppression rather than self-expression, and they are antithetical to democratic life. We let students have complete freedom to write on topics of their own choice in forms of their own choosing  so the classroom space promotes democratic processes that can foster selfhood. And because the conversations students have about experiences are, essentially, the first drafts of their writing, they are instructed how to be thoughtful about making good choices to sit with people who will inspire rich conversations about writing ideas, and to find spaces in the classroom conducive to talk. Genre Exposure To ensure that students interests develop in numerous and varied ways, teachers conduct 10-minute Genre Exposure lessons each day. In Genre Exposure lessons, teachers use a wide variety of texts to inspire students personal writing. We ask students to think of the following, in relation to a text: What is it? What is this form called? Where is it found or used? By whom? For what purpose? What is its author trying to do or achieve? What responsive understanding is she or he seeking in the reader? What literary devices or text conventions is she or he using to achieve the intended response? (What conventions or literary devices is the author using to achieve the purpose?) Take a look at students in Kate Louiss writing classroom at the Urban Assembly High School for Green Careers . They have the option to sit where they please and write what they want (so long as they submit assignments on time). Kate presented Metropolitan Diary in a Genre Exposure lesson. Heres how she did it, in her own words: I shared the wonderful Dunkin Donuts article and this one .  Before introducing the genre examples, I shared the About Metropolitan Diary piece . We talked about how this is an opportunity for anyone to submit writing to The New York Times and what a special opportunity that is.  We then read the two examples aloud together. I asked students to articulate the purpose of the genre and a ninth grader volunteered, to talk about everyday experiences in New York City. I challenged them to think about how a reader would react differently to the two different examples. They agreed that one is meant to make you laugh and one is meant to make you cry, but they both tell stories that reveal what is so special about New York.  We asked students to brainstorm places where they see special, interesting or crazy things every day in their travels around the city. They came up with the train, the bus, the park (Central Park and the parks in their neighborhoods), sports practice, the bodega and the streets around school.  Jeannie Zonneveld, my co-teacher, suggested that our school is a vibrant place full of stories, some hysterical and some heartbreaking. We are an unscreened public high school and therefore we are very much a part of the public realm. This was eye-opening for me and for the students. I think we were all recollecting our craziest subway stories until Jeannie pointed out that the stories that make New York live right where we sat. On this day, Kates discussion detailed the traits and features of the Metropolitan Diary form. Her use of the exposure lesson  which can be used with any other form from The Times or any other text  helped surface students insights about how texts function. This helped them gain a better understanding about how to use texts  both composing and decoding them  to better communicate with others. Note : Take a look at this handout of Genre Collection Probes to use with students to help them analyze texts and to guide your own Genre Exposure lessons.  Photo        Chiara Maldonado, Alysha Ramirez meet with Winni Zhu, who is sharing her writing in a Writing Share.   Credit Kate Louis    Writing Work Time After the lesson, students have 40 minutes to spend on their own writing agendas during Work Time . Staggered throughout the ranking period are due dates for projects that align with Common Core State Standards expectations for writing narratives, informative pieces and arguments. Students determine when they need to schedule deadlines for drafts and Table Share meetings with peers to get feedback. Teachers use a Writing Conference Record as a context to support self-regulation of the writing process and to provide feedback to each student on a monthly basis. The Record prompts students to consider how their writing aligns with expectations from the Common Core State Standards for writing . The Share At the conclusion of writing time is The Writing Share , in which two students take turns sitting at the front of the room, taking responsibility to gain attention and manage their audience. They project an image of their writing from the document camera, state the purpose of their piece, tell the audience what kind of feedback they want, and read it aloud.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   For example, if I were sharing a draft of a Dunkin Donuts story, I might say, This is a Metropolitan Diary, and my purpose is to move the reader. I want to know from you the ways that I can make the piece persuade readers that one persons act of compassion is enough to save the entire world through the eyes of a single person who is suffering.  Photo        A subway rider swiping a MetroCard at Times Square. Related Metropolitan Diary   Credit Michael Nagle for The New York Times    Student Writing Examples Students in Kates class werent told to write a Metropolitan Diary on the day of the lesson. In fact, most kids were in the midst of other projects of their own choosing and decided not to write a Metro Diary piece the day of the lesson. But if the texts selected for the exposure lesson are compelling, students will choose to write them. After Kates lesson, there were several takers , three of whose pieces are shared here. (Note: These pieces arent yet finalized.) Dear Diary,  To the guy I sat on the D train:  I was on my very enjoyable morning commute to school. So I got on the train like usual and I was holding the pole like a normal person trying not to die and minding my own business.  This was going well, until we got to the 9th Ave. stop in Brooklyn. Im standing there and one lady comes on the train, and in doing so, pushes me. And, like God Bless America, did she have strength. I mean it was like Sparta all over again, with her knocking me into some unforeseen doom. She pushed me so hard that my 53 bag of bones took off.  I failed to comprehend what was going on. Next thing I know, Im sitting on something soft. I was like, oh well, at least I didnt die. Then I started to register what I fell on  it wasnt some thing , it was some one .  Hey, are you O.K.? he asked, in the polite way you might ask someone who just fell onto your lap. Yeah, Im so sorry, mister, I said quickly, turning bright red. I got up, took a place by the door, and got off at the next stop.  Only, I had seven more stops to go. What a great start to the morning.   Chiara Maldonado  Dear Diary,  I am a part of what makes New York diverse. I came here from Mexico when I was two. I am an immigrant, but all I remember is New York.  My parents came here to look for a better future. They left Mexico with the mind-set of giving me and my older brother a better lifestyle. Just like my parents there are other people who have come to New York to try to achieve whatever dream they have. Ive come to realize that New York wouldnt be the city it is without immigrants.  In New York you get to experience the different places where people come from. Our childhood was mostly spent going to the bodegas that are owned by Latinos. Not only that but some of the best pizza shops in New York are owned by Italians or when youre craving rice over chicken you go to the Halal food truck. I mean, you name it, its like nothing is impossible. If you come to New York with a dream youll achieve it, trust me.   Leida Resendiz  Dear Diary:  I was already late for practice at 4:30. I was running into the train station when the speaker announced, The next uptown, local, Van Courtland-bound 1 train is approaching the station, please stand away from the platform edge.  Standing on the platform edge, people shoved in and out of the train cars with such sullen attitudes. All right miss, say excuse me, floundered across the entrances of the train with eye rolls.  Halfway through my trip, approaching 145th Street, a middle-aged lady entered the station with a tumor on her cheek. This had probably been the tenth time Ive seen her. Shes trying to raise money so that Mount Sinai can do her surgery.  She tells us her story and asked for spare change, ending with, Thank you and god bless you all.  No one on the train car spared any change.   Azra Muratovic Over the course of the year, each student develops an oeuvre of writing that reflects his or her individuality and sense of purpose as a student and a developing person, and that has been shaped through inspiration from a rich wellspring of varied and numerous text forms, such as the Metropolitan Diary, and through suggestions offered by peers about how to make the writing work as its supposed to. Conclusion If democracy and community life are one and the same, as John Dewey maintained they were, then Metropolitan Diary is democracys personal journal. Children in a democracy need opportunities to share personal stories for their own self development.

Student Opinion   By   CAROLINE CROSSON GILPIN    FEB. 23, 2017      Continue reading the main story  Share This Page   Continue reading the main story              Photo        Winston Churchill, a longtime science enthusiast, at his home in Kent, England, in October 1939. He sent an essay to his publisher that month, just weeks after Britain entered World War II, that pondered the existence of extraterrestrials.   Credit Topical Press Agency, via Getty Images     Do you like to write in a journal, or a blog? Do you have a play or a novel in the making tucked away in a drawer somewhere? Do you like to write poems, stories or songs  or to simply make lists? What do you like to write about, and why? In  Winston Churchill Wrote of Alien Life in a Lost Essay , Kimiko de Freytas-Tamura writes: Even as he was preparing for the biggest struggle of his life, leading Britain in its fight against Nazi Germany, Winston Churchill had something else on his mind: extraterrestrials.  In a newly unearthed essay sent to his publisher on Oct. 16, 1939  just weeks after Britain entered World War II and Churchill became part of the wartime cabinet  and later revised, he was pondering the likelihood of life on other planets.  Churchill, who went on to become prime minister during much of World War II and again from 1951 to 1955, was so enthralled by the subject that he even ordered a suspected sighting of an unidentified flying object by the Royal Air Force to be kept a secret for 50 years to avoid mass panic.  In an 11-page essay titled Are We Alone in the Universe? the statesman showed powers of reason like a scientist, said Mario Livio, an astrophysicist who read the rarely seen draft and wrote about it in an article published on Wednesday in Nature magazine. Students: Read the entire article, then tell us:  What purpose did writing serve for Winston Churchill, and how did it help him?    How does writing distract, calm, energize, entertain, educate or even heal us, as human beings? What do you think it is about writing that makes it so?  What purpose does writing serve in your life, and why? Students 13 and older are invited to comment.

Student Opinion   By   CAROLINE CROSSON GILPIN    FEB. 22, 2017      Continue reading the main story  Share This Page   Continue reading the main story              Photo        Logan Everett, the first boy doll from American Girl.   Credit Mattel     Did you play with dolls when you were a child? Describe your experience with dolls when you were younger. Do you find that dolls seem to be made primarily for girls, and that boys are typically missing from doll lineups? Should there be more boy dolls? In  American Girl's New Doll: It's a Boy! , Julie Creswell writes: American Girls newest doll is ... a boy?  For the first time in its 31-year history, American Girl, a maker of pricey 18-inch dolls, is introducing a boy. His name: Logan Everett.  With his perfect boy-band brown hair, hipster T-shirt and dark-wash jeans, its perhaps no surprise that in the American Girl world, Logan plays the drums in his friend Tenney Grants band.  But Logans appearance is certainly a change for the brand. The unveiling of Logan on Tuesday comes after nearly a year of rumors that the American Girl franchise was working on a boy doll.  He is the latest push by Mattel, which acquired the Wisconsin-based doll maker for $700 million in 1998, to create more contemporary figures and stories for American Girl, and to further diversify the line of the dolls in hopes of improving sales. Revenue was flat last year, at $570 million, after a long period of growth. Late last year, American Girl named its first limited-edition African American Girl of the Year, Gabriela McBride. Like most American Girl dolls, Gabriela costs $115. Students: Read the entire article, then tell us:  Would you have wanted to play with Logan when you were a child? Why or why not?  Should Mattel offer a complete line of boy dolls in the American Girl collection, each with a backstory tied to a historical period or place, similar to the historical American Girl dolls? Why or why not?    Does American Girls new boy doll fill a need for young children? If so, how? If not, why not? See this related Times opinion column from the mother of a son who wanted boy dolls, and this Times O pinion piece, from a writer who doesnt see a need for the new American Boy doll.

Image The Klimat Lounge, where unknown comedians regularly wander in to try out their material. Credit Christian Hansen for The New York Times By  Shannon Doyne Feb. 21, 2017 Have you ever shared an artistic talent with the world? For example, do you have experience with performing at an open mike night, auditioning for a play, submitting creative writing to a literary magazine or entering visual art for consideration for an art show or fair? What was this experience like? In  Inside the Brutal World of Comedy Open Mikes , Sopan Deb writes: On any given night, there are dozens of open mikes in the five boroughs. They are often in basements and back rooms, tucked out of sight, and there is no compensation. Many times, the comics  most of them male  must pay a small price to get a few minutes  a tight five. These sets serve as the birthplace of jokes that will someday make paying crowds guffaw and as the graveyard of those that dont. The open mikes draw comedians of all experience levels, and many do more than one per night, testing whether a joke should be nurtured or laid to rest. The material features a wide collection of topics: heartbreak, the mundane, race, gender, heartbreak, religion, more heartbreak. At a time when most late-night comedy shows and stand-up professionals are focusing on President Trump, these open mikes can be a refuge from politics  a reminder that modern American humorists have not been entirely consumed by the 24/7 news cycle. The crowds are brutal, making it tougher for comedians to test their material. The audiences are made up almost entirely of fellow comedians. They are often scribbling their own jokes and running through their own sets mentally rather than paying attention to the stage. Sometimes, theyre just not interested in laughing. They want to be the funniest guy in the room. A crowd of comedians is tough just because were kind of jaded, said John Donovan, 26, who attends up to 15 shows a week. I see comedy two or three times a day already. Most of it is at an open-mike level. So youre not expecting it to be that good. Students: Read the entire article, then tell us:  What do you think about the tough crowds that make up the audience at open mike comedy shows, as described in the audience?  What do you think draws people to perform  and attend  open mike nights of any variety?  Do you relate to any of the ideas or experiences described in the article, even if you havent tried stand-up comedy? Explain.  What advice do you have for anyone who wants to share an artistic talent with others but has some apprehension about doing so?  What traits do you think are common among people like singers, actors, dancers, musicians, writers and other artists when it comes to putting their creative work in front of other people? Why?
