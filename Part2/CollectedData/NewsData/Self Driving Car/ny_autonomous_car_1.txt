Credit Christof Stache/Agence France-Presse  Getty Images     Germany has long been a leading player in the old economy. Were this 1980, we would call it a titan of industry. And its biggest industry, by far, is cars. Germany makes some of the worlds most popular vehicles, not to mention some of the finest. (Lets forget Dieselgate ). But this is no longer 1980, and the car industry isnt what it used to be. Across the globe, automakers are preparing for rapid change. There will be new sources of fuel  electric cars are becoming more and more popular  as well as new ways to drive, including, of course, cars that drive themselves.  Photo        Then theres the question of ownership. Today, most cars spend most of their day parked. Car-sharing services like Uber argue that thanks to technology, each car can become more productive  and if that happens, wed probably need far fewer cars. These changes could upend the German economy. But the Germans arent sleepwalking into the future, write Jack Ewing and Mark Scott. Executives at some of the countrys leading car companies are pushing a slate of initiatives that could change how we think of the German automotive sector. They are building or investing in car-sharing companies of their own, and they are expanding their electric options. But perhaps most interestingly, German car companies are starting to think of themselves as more than just manufacturers, and instead as incubators of new ideas. Its a very Silicon Valley way of thinking. As one executive told Mr. Ewing and Mr. Scott: The biggest skill you have to have is the ability to change.

Next week hes going to decapitate another car, probably a Cadillac ATS. At first glance it might seem a crazy idea, but to Mr. Moran its a growing business. His company, Drop Top Customs, in High Springs, Fla., specializes in extreme automotive makeovers  mainly of turning cars like the Challenger and the ATS into convertibles. We did 60, 65 cars last year, and well probably do twice that this year, Mr. Moran said by telephone while taking a break from vehicular surgery. I think were coming into a nice upswing again. The rising demand at Drop Top Customs is a stark contrast to the overall convertibles business. Car sales in general are slumping, as Americans flock to roomy models like sport utility vehicles that are more suited to family life and active living. And convertible sales are in a tailspin.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   Automakers sold just over 111,000 convertibles in the first 11 months of 2016, according to Edmunds.com, an auto-shopping website. A total for the full year has not yet been compiled. But considering that few convertibles are sold in cold-weather months, the industry is sure to register a steep decline from the 2015 total of almost 134,000.  Continue reading the main story         Advertisement   Continue reading the main story       Fewer than 1 percent of all the new vehicles sold in the American market are convertibles. Back in their heyday, in the 60s, they made up about 6 percent of the total. A lot of people like the idea of a convertible on a sunny day, but for a daily drive, it can be a grind, said Jessica Caldwell, a senior analyst at Edmunds.com . Theyre just not very practical unless it is your second or third car. As sales have declined, automakers have pulled many convertible models, like the Toyota Solara, Pontiac Solstice and Ford Thunderbird, as well as the drop-top versions of the Chrysler Sebring, PT Cruiser, Lexus SC and Mini Cooper. Among those still chugging along: the Ford Mustang, the Chevrolet Camaro and a variety of expensive models from European luxury brands.  Photo        Jeff Moran, the owner of Drop Top Customs in High Springs, Fla., said his company converted 60 to 65 cars to convertibles last year.   Credit Charlotte Kesl for The New York Times    Topless driving, with the sun shining in, retains its powerful allure for some people, though, even as convertibles lose their broader appeal. That is where businesses like Drop Top Customs have stepped in. After the factory-built roofs are buzzed off, Mr. Moran and his crew install convertible tops of his own design. He also welds additional steel supports to the underbody, to make up for the strength and stiffness that the rigid roof normally provides. Doors, windows, seatbelts and other parts are modified, too. He charges $18,000, and has a backlog of orders. Last year, Dale Laur, a nurse anesthetist from North Branch, Mich., ordered a 2016 Dodge Challenger with a Hemi V8 engine and a purple finish  Plum Crazy, its called. He had the car shipped directly from the factory to Drop Top Customs in High Springs, 75 miles southwest of Jacksonville. I just love how it feels in a convertible, Mr. Laur said. Its freedom, wind in your hair.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   After the transformation was complete, Mr. Laur flew down to Florida, picked up the car and headed north. On the road and at most every stop, he said, people stared and took pictures of the car. While still on the road, he learned one of the photos had already found its way onto a Detroit muscle car blog.

Wed be riding along the freeway and people were pulling up next to us, waving and taking pictures, thumbs up. Ken Kelly, a classic car dealer from Texas, had Drop Top Customs modify a 2013 Challenger SRT8, and people would come up and offer to buy the car. He sold it after about a year, making enough to cover all his costs and then some. He recently bought a Hellcat Challenger, which features a huge 707-horsepower Hemi engine, and has sent it off to Mr. Moran, too. Im pretty sure it will be the only Hellcat Challenger convertible in existence, Mr. Kelly said. He figures hell drive it for a bit and then sell it for a profit.  Photo        The work space of Drop Top Customs. It takes about two to three weeks to change a sedan into a convertible.   Credit Charlotte Kesl for The New York Times    It takes about two to three weeks to change a sedan into a convertible. Before any cutting begins, the car is stripped of its hood, body panels, seats and interior. Next, steel supports, mainly square tubing, are welded to the underbody and behind the wheels. All told, about 200 pounds of steel are added to the car. Mr. Moran is not an engineer, but he draws on a long previous career as a police officer specializing in accident reconstruction, work that gave him knowledge of how cars are built to withstand crashes. Once the steel is in place, the cutting begins and the roof is removed. New power windows replace the fixed windows in the rear seat. Small connectors or jigs that will secure the new folding roof are welded to the cars body, and then the roof itself is welded in place. Mr. Moran noted that all his components are American made. Glass windows come from Ohio, the tops from the Carolinas, hydraulic cylinders from Kentucky. Drop Top Customs isnt the only company filling the desires of people like Mr. Laur. Newport Convertible Engineering in Southern California also creates convertibles. Much of its work involves high-end luxury cars, like Ferraris and Lamborghinis. It has offices in Dubai and Barcelona, Spain, to serve customers in the Middle East and Europe.

The company is working on an order for 100 Tesla Model S convertibles from an investor who hopes to turn a profit selling them to rich car enthusiasts in China and elsewhere. This week it also announced a plan to create convertible versions of the Ford F-150 pickup truck. We think this is going to be a big hit, Mr. Zadeh said. It will sell like hot cakes. Ed Pobur, the general manager of a Cadillac dealership in Novi, Mich., thinks theres still potential for convertible sales. The ATS that Mr. Moran will cut into soon is one of two Mr. Pobur sent to Drop Top Customs to be transformed, and hes eager to have them in his showroom as spring arrives. Were going to display them on the corner in front of the dealership. Well put the top down to show it off, he said. And hopefully well be ordering a bunch more.

His love of American cars is unusual in Japan.   Credit Ko Sasaki for The New York Times     TOKYO  Yoshihiro Masuis growling Ford hot-rod, its sides adorned with the Stars and Stripes, attests to his love of American cars  an unusual passion in Japan, where Toyota, Honda and other domestic brands rule the roads. Japanese cars dont break down, but theyre boring, said Mr. Masui, 67, a semiretired music producer. Besides the hot-rod  a replica Model T with a racecars engine  he owns a gleaming white Ford Thunderbird , the latest of nearly 70 Detroit-made vehicles he figures he has bought and sold over the years. You definitely stand out, he said. Detroit pines for a day when the sight of an American car on a Japanese street is not so notable. Even as Japanese cars have taken a wide portion of the United States market, American brands are barely visible in Japan, a situation that has long frustrated American auto executives and trade negotiators and has become a renewed source of political friction under President Trump.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   Mr. Trump accuses Japan of shutting American producers out, by throwing up regulatory barriers and rigging the currency market in favor of Japanese brands. They do things to us that make it impossible to sell cars in Japan, he said in a meeting with American executives last month.  Continue reading the main story         Advertisement   Continue reading the main story       Such talk is alarming in Japan, where the auto industry is a pillar of the economy. When Prime Minister Shinzo Abe meets Mr. Trump starting on Friday, averting a trade war will be at the top of his agenda. Mr. Abes government has been floating proposals, like using Japanese pension money to fund Mr. Trumps infrastructure plans , that might mollify the president and help offset Japans large trade surplus. To the Japanese, Mr. Trumps accusations about trade barriers can seem bizarre. Of course American cars dont sell in Japan, said Mr. Masui, whose admiration for American vehicles does not extend to their manufacturers marketing strategies. American cars have a bad image  they arent fuel-efficient, they break down, he said. Thats not really true anymore, but dealers dont make an effort to convince people. Ive never seen a TV commercial. You go to a car show, theyre not there. The cars are certainly not on the streets. Of the nearly five million cars and light trucks sold in Japan last year, just 15,000 were American, or 0.3 percent. Toyota sells more vehicles at a single mega-dealership in California. Masato Suzuki manages a car dealership in Machida, a suburb west of Tokyo, that specializes in American imports. His lot is lined with hulking Lincoln Navigator S.U.V.s, full-size commercial vans and muscle cars like Dodge Chargers and Ford Mustangs. These are the sort of American vehicles that people buy in Japan, when they buy them at all. He says his customers are overwhelmingly men. I mean this affectionately, but theyre a bit unusual, he said. I suppose were a bit unusual to sell these cars, too. Mr. Suzukis dealership, Glide, opened 24 years ago, when Detroits reputation for quality was at a low. The cars broke down all the time. Customers were always angry at us, he said. Glide has since opened two branches, but they deal only in European cars, which are more popular in Japan.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   Mr. Suzuki said he would like to expand his offerings to smaller, more budget-friendly American vehicles  the kind that are the staple of Japans own auto industry, and which most Japanese drive. But he doesnt think they would sell. Ingrained skepticism about American cars reliability and fuel efficiency is one problem. Another is price. Mr. Suzuki said he did not know whether Japan was deliberately weakening the yen, as Mr. Trump claims, but he agrees with the American president that a stronger Japanese currency is better for American car sales.  Photo        Japanese cars dont break down, but theyre boring, Yoshihiro Masui said. He estimates that he has bought and sold nearly 70 American-made vehicles.   Credit Ko Sasaki for The New York Times    When the yen soared after the 2008 global financial crisis, making imports cheaper for Japanese buyers, Glide was importing about 100 vehicles a month. Now, with the yen weaker again, it brings in only one-tenth as many. Most of the time, for the same money, a Japanese car is a better deal, he said. Defenders of Japans trade practices note that Japan imposes no border taxes on cars, whereas the United States adds a 2.5 percent tariff to Japanese imports. And they point to the relative success of European brands. Mercedes-Benz, BMW and others have captured about 6 percent of the Japanese market, mostly at the luxury end.

Privacy Policy  Opt out or contact us anytime      German cars are popular in Japan, but American cars hardly sell at all, Akio Mimura, chairman of the Japan Chamber of Commerce and Industry, said at a news conference this month. If theyre going to sell cars in Japan, its obvious that they need to make an effort to appeal to Japanese customers. Yet, even European carmakers complain that the Japanese market can be tough going, with taxes, safety standards and other rules that they think favor domestic producers. Negotiators for the European Union are pressing Japan on such structural issues in talks over a proposed trade accord. An example is headlights. In many countries, it is standard practice for drivers to keep their headlights on during the day, for safety reasons. Many cars daytime running lights switch on automatically as soon as the engine is started. Japan, though, took the opposite approach for years: Keeping headlights on during the day was illegal. That meant foreign carmakers had to disable the automatic feature on cars they exported to Japan, an extra production stop that added to costs. Kenji Kobayashi, executive director of the Japan Automobile Importers Association, which represents foreign car companies in Japan, says structural barriers are lower than they used to be. Japan scrapped the prohibition on daytime running lights last year, after negotiations with the association.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   It is also reducing the tax advantages it gives to a category of microcars known as kei cars, which account for about a third of domestic sales and are made only by Japanese automakers. The change is making a difference: Kei sales dropped 9 percent last year. Mr. Trumps approach to trade is arguably slowing progress. During negotiations over the Trans-Pacific Partnership, the Pacific Rim trade deal Mr. Trump abandoned after taking office, Japan agreed to recognize more American auto safety standards and streamline certification procedures for imported vehicles. But now that the United States has pulled out, those concessions are at risk. Mr. Kobayashi sees a difference between European and American efforts to woo Japanese car buyers. European brands advertise aggressively and have done more to customize their products for Japan, for instance by producing right-hand-drive versions of their vehicles  a seemingly obvious selling point, in a country where the driving lane is on the left, that American producers have long been criticized for ignoring. The best-selling American brand in Japan is Jeep, which last year accounted for close to half of all American auto sales there. It offers right-hand-drive vehicles  a legacy of the customized delivery vehicles it once made for the United States Postal Service, which let drivers step out onto American curbs instead of the road. Catching up to the Europeans would require investments that American carmakers are increasingly reluctant to make, Mr. Kobayashi said. Ford scrapped its small dealer network last year, and is focusing in China. China is big and growing, and foreign brands are putting their efforts there, Mr. Kobayashi said. Mr. Masui, the car collector with the souped-up Model T, says he loves everything about America before the 1960s  cars, furniture, music, everything. He might well get along with President Trump. But he says American automakers should stop complaining about trade barriers and focus on more basic tasks: making attractive cars and persuading people to buy them. Mr. Trump is interesting, he said, but what he says about cars is just weird.   Correction: February 16, 2017   A picture caption with an article on Friday about the difficulties of selling American cars in Japan referred incorrectly to a quotation. As the article correctly noted, the source of the quotation was President Trump, not Yoshihiro Masui, a Japanese enthusiast of American cars, and Mr. Trump said that Japan, not Detroit, does things that make it impossible for United States automakers to sell cars in Japan.

And yet, both have made a comeback. When the government put them into receivership, the idea was to run down Fannies and Freddies debt and develop a healthy and growing mortgage market free of the implicit government backing that they had enjoyed. Instead, almost nine years later, these so-called government-sponsored enterprises are still the largest suppliers of mortgages. Fannie is even guaranteeing $1 billion of debt backed by Invitation Homes, a single-family rental business owned by Blackstone, making the leap into the home rental market.

The American Bar Association, the law school accreditor, found that it did not satisfy its admissions and curriculum standards, which meant that students would not qualify for federal loans. It is now relying on the Education Department to change that.

Mr. Harms, chief executive at MOIA, a Volkswagen-backed ride-hailing start-up, moved to Berlin, which has a growing tech scene.   Credit Gordon Welters for The New York Times     WOLFSBURG, Germany  One of the first things Ole Harms did after taking over Volkswagen s new ride-hailing start-up was leave town. Staid Wolfsburg, Volkswagens home, was not the best place for the automaker to mount a defense against Silicon Valley challengers keen to upend the car industry, and he needed to move. Nobody knows how the world is going to look in the coming years, said Mr. Harms, a bearded 41-year-old dressed in a gray cardigan over a crisply pressed white shirt. The biggest skill you have to have is the ability to change. So he packed up and took his team to new digs in Berlin, where increasingly urgent attempts to tap into a growing tech scene are part of German carmakers efforts to ride a digital wave sweeping the industry  before it rolls straight over them.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   Autonomous driving, electric cars and ride-hailing apps from Silicon Valley, like Uber, are reshaping transportation. Young people no longer feel as compelled as previous generations to own cars. And Wall Street shows scant respect for automakers and their global manufacturing prowess: The market value of Google, which is building a driverless car, is more than double that of BMW , Daimler and Volkswagen combined.  Continue reading the main story         Advertisement   Continue reading the main story       At stake is the fate of the German economy, Europes largest, at a time when the region is only beginning to emerge from a decade-long economic malaise. Germany , in particular, is as dependent on its carmakers as Michigan is on Chrysler, Ford and General Motors. Industry executives here often cite how Apples iPhone quickly erased Nokias once-dominant position in the mobile handset market, and they are determined not to let something similar happen to them. I am convinced that we are going to see more change in the next 10 or 15 years than we have seen in the last 100 years, Peter Schwarzenbauer, a member of the BMW management board, said in a telephone interview. The big question is always, Do we car manufacturers learn to become tech companies more quickly than a tech company learns to be an automotive player? Non-German carmakers have readily embraced Silicon Valley through partnerships and investment deals. Fiat Chrysler, for instance, is working with Google on self-driving cars. General Motors has poured $500 million into Lyft, the ride-booking service. And Volvo, the Swedish automaker owned by Geely of China, provided the chassis for Ubers recent driverless car tests . By contrast, Germanys automotive giants have favored a more confrontational approach. That has been backed by many locals, who have so far rebuffed Ubers aggressive local expansion plans that have often run roughshod over domestic regulation, and by German politicians eager to please some of the countrys biggest employers. BMW, for example, is working with the chip maker Intel and Mobileye , an Israeli tech company, to develop a self-driving car of its own by early in the next decade. It has also formed a partnership with IBM to use artificial intelligence to allow vehicles to automatically adapt to their owners preferences. To combat the likes of Tesla, the California electric automaker, BMW is planning to expand its i Series line of battery-powered and hybrid vehicles. Since 2014, it has sold 100,000 of the i3 model, which runs on batteries and has a lightweight carbon fiber body.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   Daimler, the maker of Mercedes-Benz cars and trucks, has similarly been investing in digital alternatives. Of the three automakers, it has also been the only one so far to become an active partner with Uber , albeit in a limited deal where it provides a set of its autonomous vehicles to the ride service. Daimler also owns Car2Go, a short-term car rental service; Blacklane, an upmarket ride-hailing app; and MyTaxi, Europes largest taxi-hailing service. Andrew Pinnington, chief executive of MyTaxi, said the automakers backing had allowed it to expand rapidly across Europe, where it has often teamed up with local taxi associations to combat the rise of Uber. This is a game that requires deep pockets, Mr. Pinnington said. The German carmakers digital plans have led to increased collaboration between what have long been staunch rivals.

While not a household name, the Berlin-based company provides about 80 percent of the built-in navigation systems for cars in North America and Europe, and is the only large-scale competitor to Google Maps. The future of Germany as an industrial nation depends on how companies succeed in bringing the manufacturing and digital worlds together, said Frank Ridder, research leader for Germany, Austria and Switzerland for Gartner, a technology research firm. Taken together, the carmakers digital reboot is aimed at rejuvenating Germanys vaunted industrial base. About one-fifth of jobs in Germany are in manufacturing, double the portion in the United States. But factory jobs as a percentage of total employment have been declining for years, prompting the government to dole out hundreds of millions of euros in research and development funds to meld traditional manufacturing with the latest technology. The initiative, called Industry 4.0, reflects a dawning realization that Germanys historic success may not necessarily help the country thrive in a smartphone-centric world.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   The experience of Volkswagen is a case in point. The company, which is still dealing with its emissions cheating scandal , is the worlds biggest automaker, but was the slowest of the three to embrace the digital age, and is now trying to catch up. That is where Mr. Harms comes in. A former consultant at Capgemini, he joined the carmaker in 2008 and is now chief executive of MOIA, a new Volkswagen service that sits somewhere between ride-hailing services and traditional city bus networks. Unlike Uber, which has often run into resistance from officials in Europe, MOIA plans to cooperate with local governments and act as an extension of existing public transportation networks. Instead of lumbering buses following fixed routes, Mr. Harms said, MOIA shuttles will adjust their destinations and schedules according to customer demand. The vehicles will be electric, and in the future, some may be self-driving. MOIA has yet to sign any deals, but it is negotiating with cities including Hamburg and Berlin. It hopes to expand quickly into the United States and China. In smaller cities, Mr. Harms said, MOIA could offer an inexpensive form of public transportation, even though rivals like Uber and Didi Chuxing, a Chinese ride-hailing service, are already well established in many of these locations. The whole mobility market  transportation as a service  is just at the beginning, Mr. Harms said. Volkswagens recent push into new digital frontiers has taken on added momentum since Matthias Muller took over as chief executive after the emissions scandal . Under Mr. Muller, Volkswagen has set a goal of selling at least two million electric cars a year by 2025 as it tries to rebuild its image and reduce its dependence on diesel cars. In June, Volkswagen bought a piece of the ride-hailing business by investing $300 million in Gett, a taxi-hailing service available in cities including New York and London. But for Mr. Harms, the carmakers best hope of survival is if they can prove the value of owning big factories, even though most previous efforts by the industry  and other traditional sectors  to compete with digital upstarts have proved unsuccessful. A vehicle is extremely sensitive. You cant put out a beta version and then two weeks later an update, he said. We are the ones who already know how to do it very well.

For years, his government sold residence permits  sometimes costing up to $15,000 apiece  to thousands of Chinese millionaires. Why? A special program meant to encourage investment in Hong Kong allowed wealthy Chinese citizens to gain the right to live there if they had permanent residence in another country. As of 2013, about 9,000 Chinese obtained residence permits for Gambia. The maneuvering went on until 2015, when Hong Kong suspended the program. A review found that many of those who enrolled didnt settle in Hong Kong. Instead, they used their Hong Kong passports for easier travel to other countries (but probably not to Gambia).

Credit Benjamin Norman for The New York Times     Volkswagen has agreed to pay more than $20 billion to settle civil and criminal suits in the United States over its diesel emissions scandal, affecting almost 600,000 cars. This is what that could mean for vehicle owners: Who can take part? Owners of more than 580,000 Volkswagen, Audi and Porsche diesel cars from the 2009-16 model years.

Owners of two-liter vehicles and 2009-12 three-liter models can either sell them back to Volkswagen for a price reflecting their value before September 2015, when the diesel cheating became known, or have their cars repaired free. Customers can search for their vehicle identification numbers here . Volkswagen is still trying to fix newer three-liter vehicles to avoid having to buy them back.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   The fix, though, may reduce the engines performance and gas mileage. What about additional compensation? Volkswagen will separately offer affected owners of two-liter cars cash compensation of $5,100 to $10,000, depending on the model and year of the vehicle. They will also receive an additional $350 from Bosch, which supplied the engine software . Owners of three-liter cars will be entitled to compensation of $7,000 to $16,000, and $1,500 from Bosch.

You can cancel your lease without penalty and receive half the compensation that an owner would. Is participation in the settlement mandatory? No, car owners may choose not to participate and instead sue Volkswagen for better terms. Those owners, however, would also risk getting a lesser settlement, or none at all, if their lawsuits are unsuccessful. When will all this happen? Volkswagen is recalling or buying back the two-liter cars. All repairs and payments are to be made no later than December 2018. The settlement for three-liter cars, and Boschs share of the compensation, still is subject to review by a federal judge and a public comment period, which will take at least until May.

He helped found Grupo Bimbo.   Credit Archivo Agencia El Universal     People who eat white bread, the fashionista Diana Vreeland once said, have no dreams. Selling it is something else entirely. By introducing his sliced white bread to Mexican consumers in 1945, Lorenzo Servitje fulfilled a vision that transformed the company he helped found into the biggest bakery in the world. Mr. Servitje, who established Grupo Bimbo with four fellow dreamers, died on Friday at his home in Mexico City. He was 98. His death was announced by the company, a Mexican conglomerate whose trademarks now include Wonder Bread, Sara Lee, Entenmanns, Thomas English muffins, Brownberry, Boboli and, in Britain, New York-brand bagels. Today, if you buy Arnold bread in the East or Oroweat in the West, Freihofer in Pennsylvania or Mrs. Baird in Texas, Stroehmanns in the mid-Atlantic or Old Country in Arizona, not to mention Roman-Meal, Sun-Made and Francisco sourdough, its Bimbo, Aaron Bobrow-Strain wrote in White Bread: A Social History of the Store-Bought Loaf (2012).  Continue reading the main story         Advertisement   Continue reading the main story       White bread imperialism has come home to roost, he added. By the mid-1990s, imperialism might have been trumped by globalization. Grupo Bimbo was selling more tortillas in the United States than in Mexico. The company began as a small bakery and retail store opened by Mr. Servitjes father, a Spanish immigrant from Catalonia, in 1928. It was called El Molino  the Mill  evoking another dreamer, Don Quixote, and the plains of La Mancha. When his father died suddenly in 1936, Mr. Servitje (roughly pronounced sair-BEET-hey) inherited the business, gave up his work as an accountant and immediately began figuring out how to import modern American industrial baking technology. After being delayed by World War II , Mr. Servitje and several partners, including his brother-in-law, started Bakery Bimbo at the end of 1945. They were soon joined by his younger brother Roberto Servitje Sendra. Unaware of the pejorative connotations of the word bimbo in the United States (and Italy), the partners had innocently conjured up the name by combining the word bingo, the American version of a popular Mexican game called loteria, and the name Bambi, the wholesome white-tailed fawn featured in the 1942 Disney film  although the companys logo is a white, fluffy bear.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   The Bimbo Bear, more than a mere agent of Americanization, also reflected a shift away from the cultural ethos of the Mexican Revolution and toward the embrace of modernity a la Americana, Robert Weis of the University of Northern Colorado wrote in the encyclopedic Iconic Mexico (2015). The company began with 34 employees and 10 trucks that delivered four products: loaves of white bread in two sizes, rye bread and toasted bread.

The company reported more than $14 billion in sales in 2014. Mr. Servitje succeeded with a multipronged strategy. He marketed his cellophane-wrapped, mass-produced bread as healthful and dependable, in contrast to the traditional French rolls, or bolillos  common at Mexican breakfasts  that were unavailable intermittently during frequent labor disputes and that sometimes originated in unhygienic bakeries. In the early 1950s, sales of his white bread still lagged behind those of tortillas and bolillos, so he introduced Mexican consumers to other American-style products, like hot dog and hamburger rolls and doughnuts. (Grupo Bimbo became the countrys sole supplier of buns to McDonalds.) And after diversifying into candy and chocolate  controlling the entire process from production to delivery  Grupo Bimbo fended off potential competition by acquiring the Mexican rights to Wonder Bread. The company then broadened its distribution, expanding its market penetration in the United States beyond the South and buying companies abroad. It became the biggest baking company in the United States in 2009 after acquiring Weston Foods; two years later, it became the worlds biggest after scooping up competitors in Spain, Portugal and Argentina. Mr. Servitje was president of Grupo Bimbo until 1981 and board chairman until 1994. He also served with many civic groups and frequently wrote about business ethics. Drawing on his Catholic background on the one hand and a fear of socialism on the other, Professor Weis wrote, he urged businesses to foster a family mystique that would pre-empt class antagonism. Don Lorenzo Servitje Sendra (known as Don Lorenzo) was born on Nov. 20, 1918, in Mexico City. His parents, Juan Servitje Torrallardona and Josefina Sendra, were the children of Catalonian peasants. He studied accounting at the National Autonomous University of Mexico.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   His wife, Carmen Montull, died in 2002. He is survived by two sons, six daughters, 24 grandchildren and 50 great-grandchildren. His son Daniel Javier Servitje Montull is the chairman and chief executive of Grupo Bimbo.   Correction: February 9, 2017   An obituary on Tuesday about Lorenzo Servitje, a founder of the multinational baking company Grupo Bimbo, included a quotation from the book White Bread, by Aaron Bobrow-Strain, that misspelled the name of a brand Mr. Servitjes company owns. It is Oroweat, not Orowheat.    Correction: February 11, 2017   An obituary on Tuesday about Lorenzo Servitje, a founder of the multinational baking company Grupo Bimbo, misstated the name of the bakery and retail store opened by his father in 1928. It was El Molino, not El Molina.      A version of this article appears in print on February 7, 2017, on Page B12 of the New York edition with the headline: Lorenzo Servitje, 98, Who Built Empire by Bringing Bread Across Borders, Dies.
