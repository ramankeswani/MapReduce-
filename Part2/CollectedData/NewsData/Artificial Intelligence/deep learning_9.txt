Skin Deep   By   BEE SHAPIRO    MARCH 20, 2017      Continue reading the main story  Share This Page   Continue reading the main story            Photo        Huda Kattan, with 18 million Instagram followers and a namesake makeup line, is a dynamo in the beauty world.   Credit Duncan Chard for The New York Times     Every month there seems to be a newly minted beauty star  someone whose social media feed highlights trends, how-tos, product reviews and more to her plentiful followers. But in the world of influencers, not all fight in the same weight class. And one woman in particular has emerged as a force to be reckoned with, a Kim Kardashian West of the beauty influencer economy, if you will: Huda Kattan of @HudaBeauty , who has 18 million Instagram followers, heads a namesake makeup line and is introducing a Huda Beauty emoji collection called Hudamoji (not unlike Ms. Kardashian Wests Kimoji) this spring. That there is a resemblance to Ms. Kardashian West in looks (dark and curvaceous), style (glamorous and sexy) and family (Ms. Kattans business partner is her sister Mona Kattan; her sister Alya is her social media manager) only fuels the comparisons. Based in Dubai, Ms. Kattan was in New York recently for a Womens Wear Daily beauty event  last year the publication anointed her the Digital Innovator of the Year in the prestige beauty category. I can understand getting compared to the Kardashians, she said, reclining on a plush seat at the Park Hyatt in Midtown. Were 2017 women who are ultimately going out there, pursuing something out of passion and making a business out of it. I just cant wait for the comparisons to stop.  Continue reading the main story         Advertisement   Continue reading the main story       With what she has in store this year, Ms. Kattan, 33, may just step out from the Kardashian shadow. Her makeup line, Huda Beauty, which she introduced in 2013 with a false lashes collection, successfully expanded last year with the addition of hit lip liners, liquid matte lipsticks and an eye shadow palette.   Huda Kattans Instagram        How I like to use our #hudabeauty3dhighlight  A post shared by Huda Kattan (@hudabeauty) on Mar 19, 2017 at 6:19am PDT       Sephora, for one, was surprised at how well her lip liners (called Lip Contours because Ms. Kattan uses them to make her lips look bigger, she said) sold. As a category, lip liners are often an afterthought because they were created to support lipsticks. Yet Ms. Kattans Lip Contour release last May was one of the biggest launches in years, said Artemis Patrick, the senior vice president for merchandising at the retailer. Certainly Sephora is no stranger to makeup lines driven by social media. Anastasia Beverly Hills, Kat Von D and Natasha Denona all wield social media might. But Ms. Kattan is unique for a global reach that spans the United States, the Middle East and beyond.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   Its rare for one person to be relatable across so many countries and cultures, Ms. Patrick said. Obviously, its the power of the internet, but its a testament to her business acumen that she can translate and harness the power of her followers. Indeed, Huda Beauty continues to be a top makeup brand at Sephora Middle East. And at Harrods in London, there have been lines for Huda Beauty ever since the company set up a counter in August. Its one of our fastest growing color makeup brands, said Annalise Fard, the beauty and home director at the store. Relatable and sometimes giggly, Ms. Kattan is not in the makeup game to make a quick buck. Weve had really big brands approach us because theyre interested in investing, she said. But we own this, and Im building a brand.  Photo        Huda Beauty, introduced in 2013 with a false-lashes collection, successfully expanded last year.    Though social media fame can seem immediate, it didnt come overnight for Ms. Kattan. An Iraqi-American who was raised in Cookeville, Tenn., and Boston, she was, like many teenagers, obsessed with beauty products. We didnt grow up superwealthy, Ms. Kattan said, noting that her father was an engineering professor, while her mother stayed home to raise her and four siblings. D.I.Y. was supercool because it was affordable and you could do it really easily. (Ms. Kattan is known for some of her zanier D.I.Y. experiments on YouTube, including trying alternative makeup primers  in one video, she found Vagisil superior to KY Jelly and Milk of Magnesia. I honestly thought the lube was going to be the best primer, but it didnt work at all, she said, laughing. People in the Middle East did not necessarily like it. Ha! Sometimes I get a little chastised.) As for her renowned brow-defining skills, they were cultivated early. Im hairy, she said girlishly. If youre hairy, you have to figure out how to do them at a young age. Her lighthearted approach to beauty later translated to a WordPress blog she started in 2010 at her sister Monas urging. Ms. Kattan had taken a makeup course in California and was hoping to build a makeup clientele in Dubai, where she moved after her father took a job teaching at the American University of Sharjah. Ms. Kattan was particularly inspired by originals, like Michelle Phan, she said, adding, Her YouTube videos were like watching a movie. But her favorite was Kandee Johnson, because, she said, she did really good transformations. Eventually, Ms. Kattan would eclipse them all. Though she dabbled in YouTube, she never felt comfortable on the platform. I fell in love with Instagram, she said, even rattling off the exact month (October 2012) and phone model (iPhone 4) she had when she started her account. A couple of years later, she reached a million followers.

There is also the fact that she rarely accepts paid posts.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   Everyone is up in arms about paid posts, said the beauty publicist Alison Brod, who likens them to commercials or print ads. But by not taking money for her content, Ms. Brod said, Ms. Kattan appears more credible to her followers. That has translated to both social media currency and actual dollars. Ms. Brods client Alterna Haircare saw its Instagram following jump up by 5,000 after Ms. Kattan featured its products in a post. This year will test how well Ms. Kattan can truly capitalize on her following. She is releasing a 3D highlighter palette in April ($45 at shophudabeauty.com ), has a foundation collection in the works and, more ambitiously, is planning a rollout to 125 Sephora and Sephora inside J. C. Penney doors starting in July. For all that, Ms. Kattan will need to distinguish Huda Beauty from other social-media-driven brands that rely on a similar product assortment: liquid lipsticks, highlighters and eye shadow palettes. (See: Kylie Jenners lip kits, highlighters and, yes, eye shadow palettes.) Ms. Patrick, of Sephora, said it would come down to innovation and telling the product story well. Ms. Kattan said, I think my fun is work. Yet as her star rises, she has begun to draw a line between her work and personal life. She said she had not fully embraced Snapchat because it had no virality because you cant track, and because the platform was more personal than Instagram. My day is boring, she said. I dont know if people want to see me in meetings all the time. Even her favorite weekend activities include SWOT-ing  that is, assessing strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats  and practicing the kaizen productivity philosophy (a Japanese practice of continuous improvement). Self-confessed nerd she may be, but one with Pinky and the Brain ambitions. Her ultimate goal is global domination, she said unwaveringly. That probably sounds weird, but why not?

The original caption reads: March 1980: Please keep walking and react to the elephant, instructed the man with the megaphone who trailed the creature; apparently, it was for a film. But if this picture is any indication, it seems the window mannequins were more reactive than your average New Yorker, right, who just wanted to get where he was going. Bill Cunningham was the photographer. After working for nearly 40 years for The Times, he died in 2016. His obituary begins: Bill Cunningham, who turned fashion photography into his own branch of cultural anthropology on the streets of New York, chronicling an eras ever-changing social scene for The New York Times by training his busily observant lens on what people wore  stylishly, flamboyantly or just plain sensibly  died on Saturday in Manhattan. He was 87.  His death was confirmed by The Times. He had been hospitalized recently after having a stroke.  Mr. Cunningham was such a singular presence in the city that, in 2009, he was designated a living landmark. And he was an easy one to spot, riding his bicycle through Midtown, where he did most of his field work: his bony-thin frame draped in his utilitarian blue French workers jacket, khaki pants and black sneakers (he himself was no ones idea of a fashion plate), with his 35-millimeter camera slung around his neck, ever at the ready for the next fashion statement to come around the corner.  Nothing escaped his notice: not the fanny packs, not the Birkin bags, not the gingham shirts, not the fluorescent biker shorts.  In his nearly 40 years working for The Times, Mr. Cunningham snapped away at changing dress habits to chart the broader shift away from formality and toward something more diffuse and individualistic.

Nostalgia is a cheap crutch and a lame weapon. When the whole world is changing, though, disappearing and then re-emerging in different circumstances can be more deeply destabilizing. The things you held dear might be missing, or under attack. Adjusting is a full-time job.  Last week, the members of A Tribe Called Quest, one of the essential groups of the 1990s, came back after nearly two decades into a hip-hop world that had iterated a dozen or more times; they didnt flinch. And they returned in a moment when Americas racial tensions were at an outrageous level; they stepped into action. _________   Think you know grouse?

On March 21, the Township Committee will vote on an ordinance to prohibit commercial use of blowers from May 15 through Sept. 30. The rule would expand a pilot program enacted last spring, increasing the fine for violations to $500 for a first offense and $1,000 for the second offense. Stricter limits would be set on the days and hours that professionals could use blowers the rest of the year. If it passes, Maplewood would join a growing number of communities that have curbed the use of leaf blowers. _________   Think you know ordinance?

Researchers recently analyzed the costs and benefits of re-establishing and maintaining 16 species in Australia and New Zealand that went extinct in the last millennium.   Credit Florilegius, via Getty Images     Watch the short video below about Martha, the last Passenger Pigeon, who died in 1914.   Last Surviving Passenger Pigeon on Display  Video by Associated Press   How do you feel about the passenger pigeons demise? Would you like to see flocks of them flying overhead, hear their song, or even sample one for dinner? What are your thoughts about the extinction of this one particular bird? In  We Might Soon Resurrect Extinct Species. Is It Worth the Cost? , Steph Yin writes: With enough determination, money and smarts, scientists just might revive the woolly mammoth, or some version of it, by splicing genes from ancient mammoths into Asian elephant DNA. The ultimate dream is to generate a sustainable population of mammoths that can once again roam the tundra.  But heres a sad irony to ponder: What if that dream came at the expense of todays Asian and African elephants, whose numbers are quickly dwindling because of habitat loss and poaching?  In 50 years, we might not have those elephants, said Joseph Bennett , an assistant professor and conservation researcher at Carleton University in Ontario. Dr. Bennett has spent his career asking hard questions about conservation priorities. With only so much funding to go around, deciding which species to save can be a game of triage.  Recently, he and a team of colleagues confronted a new question: If molecular biologists can potentially reconstruct extinct species , such as the woolly mammoth, should society devote its limited resources to reversing past wrongs, or on preventing future extinctions? Students: Read the entire article, then tell us:  Is there a species you would like to see brought back from extinction? Which species, and why?  Is de-extinction wasteful, even for a case like the passenger pigeon? Why or why not? What circumstances would justify resurrecting a species?   Should society devote its limited resources to resurrecting extinct species, or try to prevent future extinctions? Why? Students 13 and older are invited to comment.

The orange circles mark the 393 registered satellite marches to be held April 22, the day the March for Science will be held in Washington, D.C.     Study the map above, or a larger version here. The orange circles indicate sites all over the world where satellite marches for the March for Science will be held on Earth Day, April 22. Look over the goals and mission of the march on the March for Science website. What are your impressions of the march as it is described by its organizers? In the Feb. 1 article  'Listen to Evidence': March for Science Plans Washington Rally on Earth Day , Nicholas St. Fleur writes: Within a week of its creation, the March for Science campaign had attracted more than 1.3 million supporters across Facebook and Twitter, cementing itself as a voice for people who are concerned about the future of science under President Trump.  Now, hoping to transform that viral success into something approaching the significance of the womens march last month, the campaign has scheduled its demonstration in Washington for Earth Day , April 22.  Yes, this is a protest, but its not a political protest, said Jonathan Berman, a postdoctoral fellow at the University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio and a lead organizer of the march. The people making decisions are in Washington, and they are the people we are trying to reach with the message: You should listen to evidence.  Last week, Dr. Berman found himself in the middle of a social media movement. While browsing a Reddit discussion about how the new administration was handling science, he came across a comment that he interpreted as a call to arms: There needs to be a Scientists March on Washington.  I thought someone should do that, Dr. Berman said, and I realized, Im someone.  He proceeded to buy a web domain, design a logo and create a Twitter account for what was then called The Scientists March on Washington. Within three days, the idea had more than 700,000 supporters across its social media platforms. Not everyone agrees that the March for Science is a good idea. In this Op-Ed Robert S. Young, a professor of coastal geology at Western Carolina University, argues that the march is a terrible idea. He writes: Talk is growing about a March for Science on Washington, similar to the Womens March the day after President Trumps inauguration. It is a terrible idea.  Among scientists, understandably, there is growing fear that fact-based decision making is losing its seat at the policy-making table. Theres also overwhelming frustration with the politicization of science by climate change skeptics and others who see it as threatening to their interests or beliefs.  But trying to recreate the pointedly political Womens March will serve only to reinforce the narrative from skeptical conservatives that scientists are an interest group and politicize their data, research and findings for their own ends. Students: Read both articles, then tell us:  Would you like to attend the March for Science in Washington D.C., or at any of the satellite sites?  What positive outcomes might arise from the March for Science? What negative outcomes? Explain.  Will the March for Science be a good thing for scientists, or ultimately politicize scientific research and trivialize it in some way? Explain your thinking.   The Times survey  Will You Attend the March for Science on Earth Day?"  asks scientists to give their opinions. Students 13 and older are invited to comment.

Credit Leslye Davis/The New York Times     Did you have any rules handed down to you when you were a small child? What were they, and how did you feel about them? Were you a rule-follower? A rule-breaker? Or did you fall somewhere in between? What was your experience with rules as a small child? In  No Nighttime, No Rules: Summertime Above the Arctic Circle , Bonnie Tsui writes about her family vacation: My husband, Matt, and I pressed our faces close to the glass, savoring the view. We had chosen this train for its proximity to wildness  an enchanted landscape carved by glaciers and largely untouched by people. In this season of 24-hour daylight, darkness came only fleetingly, from the train tunnels inside a mountain, or from behind closed eyelids.  And yes, we had asked ourselves, more than once, what we were doing here, in the land of the midnight sun, with two young boys accustomed to lights out at 8 p.m.  Inside the adjacent childrens car, our 6- and 3-year-old sons, Felix and Teddy, had gone feral, bouncing like pinballs between climbing structures in the built-in play area. What with the never-ending day and the jet lag, wed had no idea how our children would cope. There were no normal signals for sleep. What ensued wasnt sleep deprivation, exactly. It was more a kind of mania, a transformation of our boys into a special breed of excitable baby werewolf shaped by continuous exposure to the sun. Tsui continues: What did we want to be the message of this enterprise? That sometimes its fine to throw out the rules. Go to sleep at 11 p.m.? No problem. Play with swords? Breakfast for dinner, because I had a heck of a time decoding the Norwegian names of everyday items at the store? Yes, and yes. It doesnt mean that its going to be easy. But remember how fun it was to break the rules? Students: Read the entire article, then tell us:  How did you feel when you read about the Tsui familys relaxed stance on rules during their vacation? Have you ever had a similar experience?  Were there times when your childhood rules were not in effect, or not enforced? If so, when, and why?    Do you remember breaking, or wanting to break, any childhood rules? What rules were they, and what is your rule-breaking story? Students 13 and older are invited to comment.

Can you be sure youll like what you end up doingif so, how? In the Opinion essay  Will Dropping the LSAT Requirement Create More Miserable Lawyers? , Akilah Green writes: Harvard Law School recently announced that it will no longer require Law School Admission Test scores from applicants, joining the University of Arizona James E. Rogers College of Law in this new policy. Students can now submit scores on the Graduate Record Examination, known as the G.R.E., instead.  The move might succeed in expanding the pool of applicants. But heres what it wont do: increase the number of people in law school who actually want to be lawyers.  See, the LSAT is a speed bump with potential to separate those who truly want to be lawyers  the ones who thrive doing logic games in the same way theyll relish adding Bluebook-style footnotes to briefs and motions in years to come  from those who just arent sure what else to do with their lives.  I practiced at a firm for seven years. Lawyers are notoriously dissatisfied and depressed, but I had an unusually positive experience. Even so, I eventually quit, to pursue the TV writing career Id always wanted.  But not after spending  some would say wasting  10 years and six figures to get there.  The LSAT was rough. The logic games that make up its most infamous section are real killers, and my name, which means logical in Arabic, failed to give me any sort of edge. Studying was grueling, repetitive and at times mind-numbingly boring, adjectives that happen to have quite a bit of overlap with the way some lawyers would describe their jobs.  ... The test is to the desire to become a lawyer as a dating service with 2,000 personal questions and a registration fee is to the desire for a relationship. Its easier to swipe aimlessly on your phone while binging on Netflix at 2 a.m., but if swiping is all youre willing to do, that might tell you something about what you actually want.  And remember, studying for the LSAT creates a lot of angst  but so will being a lawyer, if being a lawyer isnt for you. Students: Read the entire essay, then tell us:  Do you agree that entrance exams like the LSAT can separate the people who really want to pursue a course of study from those who just arent sure what else to do with their lives? Explain.  What are other examples of requirements that can help people understand if a certain career is or is not right for them?  Have you ever experienced a similar situation, perhaps not with an academic path, but any pursuit in which the less serious are weeded out through a process?    If you have, how does your experience compare to the writers description of practicing law for seven years before moving on to a different career? Students 13 and older are invited to comment.
