By FACEBOOK/IRAQ FIRST on Publish Date February 16, 2017.  .          ERBIL, Iraq  A car bomb exploded in a crowded Shiite Muslim neighborhood in Baghdad late Thursday afternoon, the latest terror attack in the capital claimed by the Islamic State, security officials reported. At least 54 people were killed and at least 63 more wounded in the bombing, making it the deadliest in Baghdad in at least a month. The attack came as Iraqi security forces, backed by American military advisers and Special Operations forces, prepared to assault an Islamic State stronghold in Mosul, Iraqs second-largest city, about 225 miles north of Baghdad. The country has been consumed by news from Mosul, where Iraqi forces have been mounting the countrys largest military operation since the United States invasion in 2003, driving Islamic State fighters from eastern Mosul over the last month Security officials said the bomb in Baghdad went off in a parked pickup truck. Ambulances responding to the scene quickly filled to capacity, so the police and civilians helped transport other victims to hospitals, according to Abu Jafar, a police commissioner.

Continue reading the main story         Advertisement   Continue reading the main story       The Islamic State militant group, also known as ISIS or ISIL, posted a statement online claiming responsibility for the attack, and said that it was aimed at Shiite Muslims, whom many fundamentalist Sunnis consider to be nonbelievers. Shiites are a majority in Iraq and dominate the national government. Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi convened an emergency meeting with top military and security officials Thursday night to discuss efforts to combat terrorist attacks. A witness to the bombing, Amir Abas, 35, said he was standing about 150 yards from the pickup truck when it exploded. I saw a lot of burned bodies, and injured people and burned cars everywhere, he said.

Civilians in Shiite neighborhoods have often been the targets of attacks claimed by the Islamic State. Shiite militias, known as popular mobilization forces, are expected to take part in the military assault in western Mosul and particularly in the neighboring city of Tal Afar to the west. On state-run television channels in Iraq, news reports from Mosul are shown with a standing logo that says in Arabic and English, Nineveh, We Are Coming. Mosul, the last major city in Iraq where the Islamic State still maintains significant control, is the capital of Nineveh Province. Baghdad has been hit by a series of terrorist attacks recently. At least 11 people were killed Wednesday by a bombing in another used-car lot at the edge of Sadr City, a large Shiite neighborhood. A suicide bombing in January in Sadr City killed more than 30 people. Hakim al-Zamili, a legislator who heads the security and defense committee in Parliament, criticized intelligence and security officials for failing to anticipate the attack on Thursday. Mr. Zamili has been a frequent critic of the security establishment. This explosion indicates the weakness of the intelligence network in Baghdad, he said in a telephone interview on Thursday night. Islamic State terrorists are able to carry out attacks at any time and anywhere in the capital, he said.   Falih Hassan contributed reporting from Baghdad.

TAUB   FEB. 16, 2017      Continue reading the main story  Share This Page   Continue reading the main story            Photo        A deer, literally in the headlights in downtown Eastport, Me., last October.   Credit Gabe Souza/Getty Images     Over the last 30 years, as automotive lighting has graduated from incandescent bulbs to halogen, xenon and now LED, headlamps have definitely gotten brighter. But they havent necessarily gotten better. In a study last year by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety , the headlights for only one of 31 vehicles tested  a Toyota Prius v  earned a good rating. Ten models had poor headlamps. The worst performer of the lot: one version of BMWs luxury 3 Series sedan. Making good headlamps is not a mystery or even a technical challenge. Often, though, as much focus is put on how they look as part of the car design as on how well and where they throw light. Aesthetic design, not road performance, has been controlling headlamps, said Adrian Lund, the president of the insurance institute.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   But that could be changing. This year, for the first time, the institute will give its coveted highest safety rating, known as Top Safety Pick Plus, only to vehicles whose headlights receive a minimum adequate score.  Continue reading the main story         Advertisement   Continue reading the main story       The new focus on lights will most likely push automakers to ensure that their lamps not only shine brightly, but also do so far enough down the road. Already, BMW stopped offering the poorly rated halogen lamps on its 3 Series sedans; as a result, the car was designated a Top Safety Pick Plus. Headlamps have not been viewed as the safety component that they should be, said Jennifer Stockburger, the director of operations for the auto test center for Consumer Reports, which also examines headlight quality. The insurance institute first started testing headlights in 2016 to see how well lamps that swiveled around bends, known as curve-adaptive headlamps, would perform. It found that property damage liability claim rates fell 9 percent for those cars that had curve-adaptive headlamps. Working with the University of Michigan Transportation Research Institute and the Consumers Union, the institute then developed headlamp performance standards. It designated how far both low and high beams should reach around curves and in a straightaway without providing glare. To be rated acceptable, the second-highest rating, high-beam headlights have to shine at least 492 feet down the road, and 328 feet down the right side of the road on low settings. By law, headlamps today can be of any shape, as long as the light output meets specifications set by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration . Headlamps must also adequately avoid glare, or dazzle as it is known in Europe, for oncoming vehicles and pedestrians. As a result, vehicle manufacturers generally put a lot of effort into making their headlights stand out as part of a vehicles design statement, creating lights that swoop, are flush to the body, or are angled in a way that reflects the vehicles sheet metal.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   But minimum illumination distance is not mandated, and manufacturers self-certify that their lamps meet the light output criteria.  Photo        BMW and its selective-beam headlight system.   Credit BMW    And once on the road, a variety of factors  including lamps that werent aimed properly at the factory or even springs that havent settled into place yet  can sharply reduce the ability of a headlamp to shine down the road or light up the important places. Newer technologies, such as xenon and LED lamps, project light that is brighter and whiter than what traditional incandescent bulbs cast, giving the illusion that they are better. But if theyre incorrectly aimed, they can actually perform worse than older halogen systems, Mr. Lund of the insurance institute said. When testing headlights, Consumer Reports aims the headlamp according to government specifications. The insurance institute tests lamps as they arrive on the vehicle from the manufacturer. The group says that method gives the consumer a better sense of real-world performance. Regardless of approach, both groups have found vehicle makers to be responsive to their criticisms. The manufacturers are absolutely interested in our results, said Ms. Stockburger of Consumer Reports. Theyve changed the performance of their headlamps and improved them over the years that weve been testing. The insurance institute found a similar reaction. The headlamp performance of BMWs 2 Series xenon lamps went from marginal to good, simply by re-aiming the lamps. Fiat Chrysler moved to LED lamps for all but the base model of the Jeep Wrangler , and now offers xenon lamps as an option on the Jeep Renegade. And even better lighting systems could be coming soon. One new system, generically known as adaptive driving beams, illuminates the road using around 50 to 100 distinct LEDs or, as in the case of BMW, a lamp that changes angles. The goal is to get the reach of high beams without throwing glare.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   When onboard cameras sense oncoming vehicles or pedestrians, the lights can adjust automatically, either by dimming individual LEDs in the lamp or moving the light down and to the side, in essence providing always-on high beams without shining the beam into the eyes of other drivers. Adaptive driving beam headlamps are available from several manufacturers, like Audi, the Opel division of General Motors and Mercedes-Benz in Europe, but theyre not yet legal in the United States. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, the agency that can change the rules, is now weighing recommendations to make those lights legal. Were very excited about adaptive driving beams, said David Hines, director of the agencys office of crash avoidance standards. He would not predict when the standard would be approved, however. Further into the future are pixel beam headlamps, essentially matrix beam headlamps on steroids. They will use more than a thousand individually controlled LEDs that turn on and off to light or mask small oncoming objects. Developed by Osram and other lighting manufacturers, pixel beams will be able to shut light off to objects as small as a drivers face, or a rearview mirror, said Bart Terburg, Osrams automotive regulations manager. These new systems will start appearing on cars in about four years, he said. The federal government will also soon join the insurance institute and Consumer Reports in providing headlamp ratings for prospective buyers, much as it now reports on crash-worthiness and fuel economy. It hopes that such data will appear beginning with model-year 2019 vehicles. Such ratings could also increase pressure on automakers to do a better job with lighting. We want to help illuminate the road, Mr. Lund of the insurance institute said, not just make cars prettier.

Passenger drones, capable of carrying a single rider and a small suitcase, will begin buzzing above the emirate as early as July, according to the director of the citys transportation authority, part of an ambitious plan to increase driverless technology. Already, the eight-rotor drone, made by the Chinese firm Ehang , has flown test runs past the Burj Al Arab, Dubais iconic, sail-shaped skyscraper. The drone is not just a model but it has really flown in Dubai skies, Mattar Al Tayer , the director general of Dubais Roads and Transport Authority, said on Monday, adding that the emirate would spare no effort to launch autonomous aerial vehicles by July.

The drone is the latest in a series of measures to impose cutting-edge technology to help with the citys congested roadways. The ruler of Dubai, Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, announced last year that 25 percent of all journeys in the city would be conducted by driverless vehicles by 2030. The city operates the worlds longest driverless subway system and began a trial program last year using automated cars produced by Frances Easymile. In October, the city signed a deal with the Los Angeles-based Hyperloop One to study the potential for a hyperloop  a vacuum-like tube through which vehicle pods hurtle at speeds faster than airliners  between Dubai and Abu Dhabi, the United Arab Emirates capital.

TurboTax pressed me to buy its MAX benefits, promising total peace of mind. H&R Block urged an upgrade to Best of Both, so one of its tax professionals could review my return. And TaxAct coaxed me with its Protection Plus audit assistance. These add-ons, of course, cost extra. Maybe the tax software companies are trying to distinguish themselves with something besides their return-preparation programs  because, though the three offerings arent interchangeable, theyre not different enough to recommend one over the others for a straightforward return. All three will carry you through a return that includes wages, mortgage interest and real estate taxes, a few investment accounts, charitable gifts and even the occasional oddity like the purchase of an electric car or solar panels. In a world of personal drones and driverless cars, it has been a long time since tax software has seemed revolutionary, though it does still ease a tedious task.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   My tryouts suggested that the differences between TurboTax and Block were smaller than in the past. TurboTax used to stand out with its ease of use and technological polish, while Block provided better help. This year, Block sharpened its technology  it even beat TurboTax on a critical task, uploading a prior years return  while TurboTax improved its telephone helpline. TaxAct kept doing things its own quirky way, as it long has, but it capably handled the basics.  Continue reading the main story         Advertisement   Continue reading the main story       One thing that hasnt much changed this year is pricing. TurboTax still charges a premium. Block aims at the middle of the market. And TaxAct offers a comparative bargain. I tried out each providers top-level online option. (They also sell downloadable software.) In early February, TurboTax was charging $89.99 for its Self-Employed edition; Block, $54.99 for its Premium; and TaxAct, $37 for its Premium. All three charged about $35 for each state return. Prices can change during tax season. The add-ons ratchet up the fees. TurboTaxs MAX benefits, for example, cost an additional $59.99 in early February. That charge entitles users to help if theyre audited or if someone else files for a tax refund in their name. They also receive priority care when they call, as well as identity-theft monitoring. TurboTax says the services have a value of $117  a hard-to-verify claim since it doesnt sell them separately. The real enticement here, of course, is the audit help. Few things in life are as dreaded as the prospect of arm-wrestling with the I.R.S. Jennifer L. Blouin, an accounting professor at the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania, cautioned that many do-it-yourself filers may not need the protection. Audits are rare, and the I.R.S. focuses its efforts on complicated returns, like those filed by businesses or people with lots of self-employment income, who file I.R.S. Schedule C, she said. I suspect that many of the issues for a Schedule C filer pertain to adequate record keeping, something audit assistance is unlikely to help with, she said. Professor Blouin added that the frightening word audit can cover everything from in-person interrogations to a simple exchange of letters. She said she once forgot to include one of her husbands I.R.S. 1099 forms on their return. The I.R.S. sent a letter, noting the omission and asking for the missing tax and interest. She agreed and sent a check  for $37. Still, a worrier might want to pony up for audit assistance, she said: Maybe the $50 is cheaper than a prescription to Ambien, the sleep aid.

It was trying  and failing  to transfer information from my wifes and my prior-year TurboTax return to this years program. When I tried, I got a message saying that the file wasnt a tax file  it was  or that it had been corrupted. I wondered whether my browser, Chrome, was interfering, so I switched to Safari. Same result. I couldnt upload the PDF copy of our return because TurboTaxs online software doesnt allow that. Later, I tried uploading the return to the downloadable desktop version of TurboTaxs software. That worked, but dont ask why  Im the sort of person who regards technical smarts as being able to change the settings on my phone.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   Successful data transfers can spare you hours of toil and eyestrain. When they work, they fill your return with much of the prior years information that might repeat, such as personal details, varieties of income reported and charities contributed to. TurboTax also imports wage data from larger employers and financial information from bigger banks and investment companies. While I couldnt pull information from my own prior return into this years TurboTax online program, the imports from those outside sources worked as smoothly as ever  details from our employers and from Vanguard and T. Rowe Price zipped right in. Technology has long been TurboTaxs forte. Each year, it offers some new feature competitors dont quite match. This year, it was an Apple Watch app. My reaction was this: Will Siri do my return if I mumble to my wrist? Will people on the subway think Ive lost my mind? I tried out the app, and it underwhelmed  it just tells you the status of your federal and state returns, the amount of your tax liability or refund and the number of days until returns are due.

I had a question this year about logging in a contribution to an individual retirement account for a self-employed person. I was working online on my tablet and chose the option of receiving a telephone call from an expert. I got a message saying Id hear back within five minutes. A gentleman from TurboTax called within two. He suggested that I return to my desktop computer and search SEP Accounts to find the jump link, which would take me to the place where I should enter the information. That solved my problem. H&R Block If TurboTax closed the help gap this year, Block reciprocated by beating TurboTax on the transfer of last years return. As with TurboTax, I couldnt upload the prior years tax file. But Block gave me the option of uploading a PDF, and that worked. The program also vacuumed up our wage and investment information. As in the past, I found Blocks explanations the clearest; thats where Blocks long history in the tax-return preparation business  it also runs a chain of about 12,000 retail outlets  shines through. The guidance prompted me to include legal expenses Id incurred to incorporate in 2016. Id neglected to log those into TurboTax. Once, it even managed to amuse me, warning against trying to deduct expenses for a facility, like a yacht or hunting lodge, thats mainly recreational. Do people with yachts do their own taxes? But Blocks tax sophistication can sometimes stupefy. The program gave me four options for a depreciation method for my new desktop Mac. I went with the default, having no idea what the terms GDS vs. ADS or regular vs. straight-line meant. The software suggested that I take the GDS (General Depreciation System) regular method, which gives the quickest write-off. (Note to the I.R.S.: It wasnt me!) Later, the program also asked, How are you feeling about your taxes? I assumed that the possible answers would be (a) anxious, (b) annoyed or (c) on the verge of casting my laptop into Boston Harbor (yes, I live nearby). Instead, it offered anodyne choices, including I need help. I opted for that, and the program then offered Best of Both for $79.99.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   With this service, a Block tax professional will review your completed returns. You can select the person, even seeing a picture. I picked Amy Brown, in nearby Acton, Mass., and learned that her hobbies included knitting and beekeeping. It felt like Block had merged with Match.com . Maybe thatll be next years new service: have your taxes reviewed over cocktails or coffee. One thing Ms. Brown, or any Best of Both professional, wouldnt be obliged to do was represent me in person at the I.R.S. if I were audited. Block used to promise to provide audit representation for anyone who used its software. But this year, it began selling that service separately, for an additional $19.99. TaxAct  Photo         Credit TaxAct    If TurboTax is the tech-savvy sophisticate and Block the wholesome suburbanite, then TaxAct is the rowdy outsider. Its website promises to give users an unfair advantage and help them with opportunistic navigation of the United States tax code. Theyre even encouraged to tweet out their desire to #BeatTheSystem. With that rallying cry, I expected TaxAct to show me tax shelters or help me set up offshore accounts. Instead, it offered up the usual questions about income, expenses and lifes changing circumstances. Once again, the online transfer of our old return faltered. The program said it could upload a PDF, but I tried three times, over two days, and failed. I kept getting a message saying the importing capability was down for maintenance. TaxAct did upload our W-2s but didnt pull in our interest and investment income. (Shaunna Morgan, a TaxAct spokeswoman, said the latter capability would be available later in February.) TaxAct structures its questionnaire differently than TurboTax and Block do  it asks, for example, about estimated tax payments near the beginning  but the major categories covered are necessarily the same. Besides sources of income, the questions address such matters as dependents, mortgage interest and charitable contributions. At the end of TaxActs federal section, theres a fascinating feature: TaxWatch. It breaks down the federal government into categories, such as national defense and Social Security and Medicare , and gives the percentage of federal spending each accounts for. It then takes those percentages and applies them to your tax liability to tell you that you paid, say, $5,000 worth of interest on the national debt in 2016. When I see this, I want to know more. Is it really possible that, together, defense and retiree programs account for 60 percent of federal spending? How much, I wonder, are my wife and I personally paying for the Smithsonian and the National Zoo? What about the national parks? And might next years software have a feature in which I can direct my taxes toward my favorite government departments? That could be an add-on worth paying for.

Apparently, it comes with midlife. Luis, who had dedicated himself for years to saving a destitute relationship, acting like an emotional pack animal by taking on more and more weight of his partners pathologies, learned that the person sleeping next to him every night was texting in the darkness to someone else. His sudden awakening shattered his sense of reality. Carrying his partners burdens, far from simply being a sign of his kindheartedness, had actually facilitated the years of unhappiness on both ends, and the turning of backs in bed. He is not the only one I know subjected to  or the subject of  a double or even triple life. Ariadne, for instance, survives the monotony of marriage by having anonymous sex with virtual strangers. Since she lives in a small town, she relies on her minivan, inconspicuously parked in the lot of her local grade school, to hook up with other parents who drive there for pick up. Harleys approach is perhaps more innocuous, but it has just as many contorted twists. Turning a blind eye to his partners infidelities and alternative sexual preferences, he souped up a muscular old motorcycle to mechanically parade his mutilated masculinity around on dark but congested streets. At some point, it seems, life cracks. It breaks up. Half of it, or more, goes underground, if it wasnt there before. People  or, at least, some people  go through the motions of work, relationships and home life, but only part of them is present. The rest is in some parallel universe that only they, or a few close friends, actually know. They smile to the world; they blink and look back at you as if nothing else were happening. They have become so accustomed to playing their lives that it is perfectly normal. The lie is simply real. You blink and look back. Where did things go off track? Many of my closest friends seemed so together, but now their lives are coming apart at the seams or are barely stitched together. Why have I, for that matter, taken to submerging my own existence in fantasy by writing fiction, as if I could only observe the events of my life if externalized and contained, slowly circulating before me like fish in the digital aquarium of a computer screen? As my sister once explained to me in one of many desperate phone calls Ive made to her, aspirational tales dominate the first chapter of our lives. We are trained from an early age to constantly be looking up and on the ascent, working toward the next level. Our culture bombards us with legends of aspiration and ascension  in love, school, work, even play. Regardless of whether the narrative climax is one of success or failure, or some mix between the two, the implicit message is that the story ends there. Yet our actual lives go on, like insignificant characters left by the wayside as the author pursued a more engaging plot. Our lives are dominated by mundane affairs now  hectic schedules, family logistics, mindless tasks. All of the major events are behind us. The youthful dreams of a motorcycle trip through Latin America recede on the horizon of a desk filled with bills to pay. We wake up to realize that so much of life has simply happened to us, and that it is too late. We fell into lock step without even knowing it. And now there is no time for dreaming, as work and responsibilities saturate every second of the day. A crisis is a crack in the code. It can occur when everything laid out for you, and all of the things that you have half-wittingly accepted, meet a desire to be something more than the skeletal image of your own dead dreams. It can also come with the realization that life trickles away quickly, and theres no going back. A destructively liberating drive may arise, derailing you from the course of playing out your pre-established roles. When I was a child, my father would routinely wake us up on Sunday mornings by playing songs from his vinyl collection at house-shaking volume. His favorite track was  Once in a Lifetime , by the Talking Heads, and I was torn out of my dreams innumerable times by the shattering lyrics: This is not my beautiful house! This is not my beautiful wife! My God! What have I done? It is only now, that I am the same age as my father was at the time, that I understand the message he was shouting out in his silence through the voice of someone else. Cracks in the foundations of our life narratives can have the surprising effect of clearing space for unforeseeable developments. Like the seeds that sprout in toxic soil, or push up through slabs of oppressive concrete, re-emergence and reinvention become possible. Instead of playing out familiar plotlines, which would otherwise escort us all the way to the tomb, we can take over the screenplays of our lives, and we can begin to spin the most quixotic yarns, set in a wilderness untamed by moralism, careerism and the strictures of conformism. Although these types of crisis are typically affiliated with midlife, they can, and of course do, happen at any time. From childhood to old age, there is hardly a moment when one is not confronted by scripted life. When I was in the abyss of my own fishbowl-framed crisis, my brother reminded me of a time I had oddly forgotten when I, as an awkward teenager, was surprisingly given the lead role in our school play. An essential prop, which functioned as the linchpin for the entire plot and its climactic ascension, was supposed to be brought to me on stage in a basket. There was a long moment of silence, as the suspense was building, before I revealed the prop. However, on opening night, the basket was empty. As if I had been waiting for a crisis moment that would force me to squeeze out of the straitjacket of the script, I immediately began improvising my own story and the other actors followed suit. When the curtain fell, no one in the audience actually realized that, in weathering the crisis of the missing prop, we had all moved from being actors to playwrights. When I talk to Luis on the phone now, his entire life has been reshuffled. He jokes about the fact that he feels so liberated from his suffocating relationship that he would like to send a thank-you letter to his exs late-night lover. Describing a long series of intense polyqueer experiments and hilarious-only-in-retrospect Tinder escapades, his voice then quivers and hesitates as he invokes what he calls the extraterrestrial. I have never heard anyone successfully use this word as a term of endearment, but Luis slowly and carefully articulates what it is like to meet someone who completely transcends your world and all of the codes that have encased it. He refuses to call his extra-worldly encounter a love story because they are both inventing  rather than simply living out  its plot. Crisis is also about accepting the fact that life does not sew up its loose ends like a well-crafted narrative. It is messy and confused, recalcitrant to the simple moral judgments of the uninitiated. Ariadne continues to get her kicks in the parking lot, scripting her own impetuous adventure. I wonder if passers-by occasionally catch a glimpse of lifes conundrums as they marvel at the rocking of the driverless van.

Credit Kevin Hagen for The New York Times     New York City police officers fatally shot a man on Thursday after he pulled out a gun and fired at them, prompting a shootout and a chase that ended behind a Brooklyn home, the police said. Investigators recovered a silver .32-caliber revolver from the scene of the shooting, which occurred at about 4 p.m. on Belmont Avenue near Logan Street in the East New York section of Brooklyn, the police said. Neither the dead man nor the officers were immediately identified. No officers were struck in the shootout, though the police said one was taken to Jamaica Hospital Medical Center in Queens for observation. The events that led to the shooting began when the police received a tip about a potential retaliatory gang shooting around the Cypress Hills Houses, a nearby housing project in East New York, Terence A. Monahan, the Police Departments chief of patrol, said at a news conference.

After about two blocks, increasingly concerned about the man, the officers got out of the car, he said. When the sergeant and one officer exited the vehicle, the suspect drew a revolver and fired on the officers, the chief said. The officers returned fire and the subject fled on foot with the officers in pursuit. From his home down the block, Elijah, 26, said he heard a burst of six or seven gunshots, and then saw the man run off as officers followed in their car. Elijah asked to be identified only by his given name out of concern for his safety.  Newsletter Sign Up  Continue reading the main story        Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

The man was still armed, Chief Monahan said. The officer fired at the suspect again at this time, striking him, he said. The man was pronounced dead at the scene. Elijah said he had heard about 10 or 11 shots during the second burst of gunfire. During the gunfight, bystanders on the street took cover. A man and woman whose car had broken down got out of the vehicle and ran, according to Elijah, who ducked beneath his windows, he said. This happens a lot in this neighborhood, Elijah said of the gunfire. He said the violence seemed to have picked up in recent months, with several shootings in the area. At least 20 officers arrived and began canvassing the scene, he said, and then workers from the medical examiners office came to take away the mans body. Chief Monahan said investigators had not yet determined whether the man had any connection to a gang shooting in the neighborhood on Saturday night, which had prompted the concerns about retaliatory violence on Thursday.

After a 12-year hiatus, its back.  By TOM VOELK on Publish Date February 16, 2017.  Photo by Martin Campbell.  Watch in Times Video          embed            Most people who remember the original Civic that Honda brought to America in 1973 remember it as a hatchback. The less popular sedan looked exactly the same  it just had a tiny rear door instead of the liftgate. That runt of a car went on to do big things for Honda. The cars CVCC engine, which ran on both regular and unleaded gasoline (without a catalytic converter), showed Detroit and consumers that Honda had engineering chops to spare. Yes, there once were two kinds of gasoline. And I grew up with only four television stations. But thats a different story. The once stubby Civic grew into sleek coupes and sedans. By 2005, automotive trends had changed so much that the very body style that set up Honda for success vanished from its American lineup. But everything old is new again. The Civic hatch is back. With 4.4 inches taken off the rear overhang, the aggressive sheet metal creases dont play out as smoothly as on the sedans. But even with less length, the hatchback remains more useful than the sedan or coupe because its yawning opening swallows 10-speed bikes whole (another thing popular back in the 70s).   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   I drove the Sport model that retails for $22,175, plus those pesky taxes and such. The Sport, most easily spotted by its center-mounted exhaust, is a basic car. The only major option available is an $800 continuously variable automatic transmission. You want a better sound system? Thats what the aftermarket is for.  Continue reading the main story         Advertisement   Continue reading the main story       Or, move up to the Sport Touring, which throws in creature comforts plus Honda Sensing, a bundling of safety technology that includes automatic braking with pedestrian detection, adaptive cruise control and lane departure warning. Sadly, that means you give up the excellent 6-speed manual gearbox I drove and adds about $7,000 to the price (which would have bought three 1973 Civics). The Sport is not the sportiest Civic  Si and Type R models are on their way  but its tough to get more fun and practicality for your $22,000. Its the kind of car that, after a couple of miles, gets under your skin and pushes a smile onto your cheeks. Throw it into a corner and it happily obliges, then suggests you do it again. It is also a refined runner, displaying the kind of polished dynamics found on small luxury offerings a decade ago. There are baby bottoms less smooth than the 1.5-liter turbocharged four-cylinder. It puts out 180 horsepower and 162 pound-feet of torque when fed premium fuel. Thats six more ponies than the standard Civic hatch models (which lack the Sports more sophisticated knock sensor). And in another blast from the past, the engine is started with a key. The kind you insert and turn. Fuel economy will not disappoint. Uncle Sam rates the Sport with a manual gearbox at 30 miles per gallon in the city, 39 on the highway. I saw high 20s in mostly urban (and spirited) driving. Going with the automatic drops the highway figure down to 36. Youll commute comfortably until Sports low-profile tires hit a sharp bump. Those go right on through the chassis to your backside with little filtering. Moderately bolstered seats can hold a wide range of drivers in place during spirited maneuvers. Without the Tourings sunroof, the cabin is dark and monochromatic. At least its made with good-quality plastics. The leather-wrapped steering wheel feels as if it was destined for a car a full segment higher. Many cars these days have some sort of touch-screen interface. The base Sport goes the nostalgia route with a rudimentary monochromatic LCD screen reminiscent of an 80s Texas Instruments calculator. But it is supersimple to operate with an honest-to-goodness volume knob and radio station buttons. Hondas old slogan,  We Make it Simple , applies here. Dont worry, theres Bluetooth for pairing phones.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   With belts for three, the back seat has generous room for two average adults. And thats about it. There are no power ports, seat pockets or folding armrest in the back. Putting a cup of hot coffee in the door pocket is awkward and could result in spills or burned fingers. Ask me how I know. Again, its a $22,000 car. Remind friends they didnt pay for an Uber. Unless the dual spoilers and faux front and rear venting are too severe for your retinas, the Civic Hatchback should be on the test drive list. That list includes the Chevy Cruze Hatchback, Ford Focus , Mazda 3, Toyota Corolla iM and Volkswagen Golf . Practical, affordable and offering a decent romp on a curvy road, the Civic has returned to its roots. Now, if only Led Zeppelin could reunite.

But you laugh at your peril at the Ugly Brits vacationing in America in RUSH OF BLOOD (Atlantic Monthly, $25), Mark Billinghams savage satire about good friends whose special bond originated in murder. Three couples who are all from London find themselves staying at the same cheesy beach resort on Siesta Key in Sarasota. Thats as good a reason as any for Angie and Barry, Dave and Marina, and Ed and Sue to strike up a friendship when they meet at the Pelican Palms. The wives are jealous, competitive and catty, but still easier to take than their husbands. Ed is a vulgarian and a bully. Barry is a pathetic worm. Dave is a genial jackass. The thing is, one of these terrible tourists used precious vacation time to murder another guest at the resort, 14-year-old Amber-Marie Wilson, a friendly child with mental difficulties, as her mother puts it. From the killers interior monologues we learn that this wont be the last murder. Back home, where the couples have been hosting dinner parties to keep in touch, this perv is already haunting special-ed schools trolling for another victim. Billingham, who also writes the Tom Thorne mystery series, brings in investigators on both sides of the Atlantic to broaden the cast of characters and introduce some procedural details. Jeffrey Gardner, the American detective in charge, is the soul of compassion; but hed be more inclined to give up on the file if it werent for Jenny Quinlan, a trainee constable who prods him into letting her work his case along with a similar killing outside London. Even these good guys are flawed, which makes them attractively human, if not as monstrously fascinating as the Sarasota Six, as they call themselves. Nobody knows anyone really, do they? Angie muses during one of the drunken dinner parties at which the hideous husbands and their enabler wives draw on their best social skills to conceal their kinky pleasures and secret sorrows. Its maddening, the way Billingham keeps us in suspense, cringing from each character while keeping watch as if our own lives depended on it  but we wouldnt want it any other way.  The Great War is never over in the mournful tales of the mother-and-son authors who write as Charles Todd. Inspector Ian Rutledge, the Scotland Yard detective in this elegant historical series, was shellshocked in battle and is still haunted by the dead. But those personal nightmares make him profoundly responsive to the suffering of others, like the wounded souls he encounters in RACING THE DEVIL (Morrow/HarperCollins, $26.99) . In 1916, on the eve of the Battle of the Somme, a group of English officers make a bet with the Devil. Those who survive will meet in Paris and race their motorcars to Nice. At the end of the war, the race is on, but one car is forced into a ravine and the driver barely survives. A year later, in East Sussex, another racing car is rammed off the road, and this time the driver  not the captain who owns the car, but the local rector  is killed. Evidence of foul play brings Rutledge down from London to a village that, like all the rural places he has visited in this series, is still mourning its war dead. Todd writes a rich mystery, but in investigating the murder Rutledge also probes the psychic wounds of the village and tries to minister to the collective survivor guilt of the living. The dead, as the voice in his head tells him, still believe it was worth dying for.  Anyone toying with the idea of emigrating might consider Siglufjordur, the outermost village in the north of Iceland and the setting of SNOWBLIND (Thomas Dunne/Minotaur, $25.99), a first novel by Ragnar Jonasson in a chilly translation by Quentin Bates. The story is set during the 2008 fiscal collapse; but since the boom never made it this far north, the crash doesnt make an impact either. Remote as it is, Siglufjordur proves the ideal job posting for Ari Thor Arason, a former theology student who recently graduated from the police academy. Ari Thor may be naive when it comes to affairs of the heart, but he shows intelligence and persistence in investigating the apparently accidental death of a local author. This classically crafted whodunit holds up nicely, but Jonassons true gift is for describing the daunting beauty of the fierce setting, lashed by blinding snowstorms that smother the village in a thick, white darkness that is strangely comforting.  Its New Years Eve in Sam Hawkens hard-boiled action novel WALK AWAY (Mulholland/Little, Brown, $26). His protagonist puts in sweat time at the gym punching the heavy bag, rides home on a Harley, chows down on a pound-and-a-half steak, with a bottle of Jack Daniels . . . and then she falls into bed. Camaro Espinoza, who did tours in the Middle East, is tougher than an army boot. But shes got a soft spot for her sister, Annabel, who periodically calls for help with the brutal men she keeps hooking up with. Annabel sends out another distress call from Carmel begging her sister to rescue her one more time. But in dishing out punishment to Jake Collier, Camaro earns the hatred of his brother, Lukas, a stone killer whose homicidal exploits account for much of the action. Camaro isnt entirely believable as a fighting machine, but its deeply satisfying to watch her take out an animal like Lukas.

On HBO, Girls returns for its final season, and Last Week Tonight With John Oliver is back for the first time since the week after the election. Whats on TV THE 59TH ANNUAL GRAMMY AWARDS  8 p.m. on CBS . James Corden, the late-night talk-show host and car-pool karaoke impresario, will host the Grammys for the first time after a warmhearted debut as the host of the Tony Awards last June. Of course, Beyonce is nominated, as are other pop titans like Adele and Justin Bieber. The program will also include tributes to George Michael and Prince. Tune in at 7:30 for the red carpet coverage on CBS, or at 6 p.m. for E!s red carpet broadcast. Earlier, at 7, 60 Minutes presents a Grammy-themed program that features moments from Steve Krofts 2010 interview with Beyonce; Anderson Cooper in conversation with Adele in 2012; and Lara Logan speaking in November with Bruno Mars, who takes her back to his Hawaiian roots and talks about how he writes catchy hits like Uptown Funk. THE MISSING  8 p.m. on Starz . This mysterious drama , about a woman who disappears from her hometown and reappears 11 years later, is back for Season 2 . But dont expect more of the same plot  or characters. Now the detective Julien Baptiste is hard at work on the case of another missing girl. If you want to play catch-up with Season 1, check it out on Amazon or Vudu.  Photo        Norman Reedus and Danai Gurira in The Walking Dead.

Stick around for The Talking Dead at 10:13. THE HUNCHBACK OF NOTRE DAME (1939) 9:45 p.m. on TCM . Forget Disney, and forget charm. This is Victor Hugos novel, pushed to its terrifying extremes. The film is almost unrelievedly brutal and without the saving grace of unreality, which makes Frankensteins horrors a little comic, Frank S. Nugent wrote in The New York Times. The only joyously fantastic note in the whole proceedings is the scene where Quasimodo swings, like Tarzan, on a rope from the cathedral tower to the scaffold, plucks the Gypsy Esmeralda from the hangmans grasp and  in haughty defiance of all the rules of pendulum  swings grandly back to the tower again, hoarsely bellowing Sanctuary! Sanctuary! instead of the ape-mans war cry.  Photo        Lena Dunham in Girls.   Credit Mark Schafer/HBO    GIRLS  10 p.m. on HBO . Hannah, Marnie, Jessa and Shoshanna are back for one last season , which begins with Hannah on assignment at a female surf camp in the Hamptons. Meanwhile, Marnie tells Ray he needs to spend more time at his own apartment, but he cant stand to be there when Adam and Jessa are as well. Also back for a new season is the satirical news program Last Week Tonight With John Oliver , at 11. This show hasnt been on the air since Nov. 13. It has a lot of catching up to do.
