Credit Stephen Crowley/The New York Times     SAN FRANCISCO  From self-driving cars to multi-language translation, machine learning is underpinning many of the technology industrys biggest advances with its form of artificial intelligence. Now, Googles parent company, Alphabet , says it plans to apply machine learning technology to promote more civil discourse on the internet and make comment sections on sites a little less awful. Jigsaw, a technology incubator within Alphabet, says it has developed a new tool for web publishers to identify toxic comments that can undermine a civil exchange of ideas. Starting Thursday, publishers can start applying for access to use Jigsaws software, called Perspective, without charge. We have more information and more articles than any other time in history, and yet the toxicity of the conversations that follow those articles are driving people away from the conversation, said Jared Cohen, president of Jigsaw, formerly known as Google Ideas.

This has prompted some publishers to turn off the comments section because moderating them can be time-consuming.  Continue reading the main story         Advertisement   Continue reading the main story       With machine learning, a computer system is programmed to learn from repetition. It takes in training data  essentially, example after example  until it is familiar enough to anticipate with a high degree of confidence the proper response.  Photo        Googles offices in Mountain View, Calif.   Credit Michael Short/Bloomberg    In this instance, Jigsaw had a team review hundreds of thousands of comments to identify the types of comments that might deter people from a conversation. Based on that data, Perspective provided a score from zero to 100 on how similar the new comments are to the ones identified as toxic. Jigsaw said it settled on the word toxic after finding that most reviewers shared views about what types of comments drive people away from a conversation. Opinions about what comments constituted, for example, a personal attack ranged widely. The same methodology is being provided to publishers, who could use the scores to have human moderators review comments only for responses that registered above a certain number, or allow a reader to filter out comments above a certain level of toxicity.

The Timess comments section is managed by 14 moderators, who manually review nearly every comment. Because this requires considerable labor and time, The Times allows commenting on only about 10 percent of its articles. The Times said in a statement last year that it made its comments archive available to Jigsaw to help develop the machine-learning algorithm running Perspective. Linda Zebian, a spokeswoman for the Times, declined to comment on Wednesday. Mr. Cohen said the technology was in its early stages and might flag some false positives, but he expected that it would become more accurate over time with access to a greater set of comments. Jigsaw, whose stated mission is to use technology to tackle geopolitical challenges such as cybersecurity attacks and online censorship, said it also saw opportunities for its machine-learning software to identify comments that are off-topic or unsubstantial.

Salisbury/McClatchy Company and Tribune Company, via Getty Images     The Portuguese authorities have detained a former undercover C.I.A. officer whose extradition has been sought by Italy , where she faces a prison sentence over her role in the 2003 kidnapping of an Egyptian cleric as part of a secret United States rendition program. The former officer, Sabrina De Sousa, 60, was detained Monday night and is awaiting imminent extradition to Italy, one of her lawyers, Dario Bolognesi, said. Ms. De Sousa was among 26 Americans convicted of grabbing the cleric , Osama Moustafa Hassan Nasr, also known as Abu Omar, in Milan in February 2003. The operation was one of the so-called renditions ordered by the George W. Bushs administration after the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001. Suspects were captured and taken to other countries for interrogation. The program was ended by the Barack Obama administration. Mr. Nasr was taken to a military base before being moved to Egypt, where he said he was tortured. In 2013, an Italian court sentenced him in absentia to six years in prison for terrorism-related activities.

He has also requested that she serve her time doing public service, rather than be jailed. Ms. De Sousa is likely to serve her prison sentence in Milan, Mr. Bolognesi said, because the European arrest warrant had been issued by prosecutors there. Her lawyer in Portugal, Manuel de Magalhaes e Silva , could not be reached for comment. Ms. De Sousas case is among several related to rendition operations that have been brought to trial. In January, Britains Supreme Court ruled that Abdel Hakim Belhaj, a Libyan dissident who said he was abducted and tortured by American and British intelligence agents, could sue the British government and a former foreign secretary over his rendition.

But as jobs go away, what of presidential promises to bring them back?   By CLIFFORD KRAUSS FEB. 19, 2017          MIDLAND, Tex.  In the land where oil jobs were once a guaranteed road to security for blue-collar workers, Eustasio Velazquezs career has been upended by technology. For 10 years, he laid cables for service companies doing seismic testing in the search for the next big gusher. Then, powerful computer hardware and software replaced cables with wireless data collection, and he lost his job. He found new work connecting pipes on rigs, but lost that job, too, when plunging oil prices in 2015 forced the driller he worked for to replace rig hands with cheaper, more reliable automated tools. I dont see a future, Mr. Velazquez, 44, said on a recent afternoon as he stooped over his shopping cart at a local grocery store. Pretty soon every rig will have one worker and a robot. Oil and gas workers have traditionally had some of the highest-paying blue-collar jobs  just the type that President Trump has vowed to preserve and bring back. But the West Texas oil fields, where activity is gearing back up as prices rebound, illustrate how difficult it will be to meet that goal. As in other industries, automation is creating a new demand for high-tech workers  sometimes hundreds of miles away in a control center  but their numbers dont offset the ranks of field hands no longer required to sling chains and lift iron.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   So while there is a general sense of relief in the oil patch that a recovery is gaining momentum, discussions at company meetings and family kitchen tables are rife with aching worries, especially among those who are middle-aged with no more than a high school education.

The job losses just in Texas, the most productive oil-producing state, totaled 98,000.  Continue reading the main story         Advertisement   Continue reading the main story        Several thousand workers have come back to work in recent months as the price of oil has begun to rise again, but energy experts say that between a third and a half of the workers who lost their jobs are not returning. Many have migrated to construction or even jobs in renewable energy, like wind power. People have left the industry, and they are not coming back, said Michael Dynan, vice president for portfolio and strategic development at Schramm, a Pennsylvania manufacturer of drilling rigs. If its a repetitive task, it can be automated, and I dont need someone to do that. I can get a computer to do that. Indeed, computers now direct drill bits that were once directed manually. The wireless technology taking hold across the oil patch allows a handful of geoscientists and engineers to monitor the drilling and completion of multiple wells at a time  onshore or miles out to sea  and supervise immediate fixes when something goes wrong, all without leaving their desks. It is a world where rigs walk on their own legs and sensors on wells alert headquarters to a leak or loss of pressure, reducing the need for a technician to check. And despite all the lost workers, United States oil production is galloping upward, to nine million barrels a day from 8.6 million in September. Nationwide, with a bit more than one-third as many rigs operating as in 2014, production is not even down 10 percent from record levels.  Photo        Eustasio Velazquez at his home in Andrews, Tex. He has lost oil jobs as the technology in the industry advances.   Credit Ilana Panich-Linsman for The New York Times    Some of the best wells here in the Permian Basin that three years ago required an oil price of over $60 a barrel for an operator to break even now need about $35, well below the current price of about $53. Much of the technology has been developed by the aviation and automotive industries, along with deepwater oil exploration, over more than a decade. But companies drilling on land were slow to adapt until oil prices crashed and companies needed to get efficient quickly or go out of business.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   All the big companies, and many smaller ones, have organized teams of technicians that collect well and tank data to develop complex algorithms enabling them to duplicate the design for the most productive wells over and over, and to repair valves and other parts before they break down. The result is improved production and safety, but also a far smaller work force, and one that is increasingly morphing from muscle to brain power. Pioneer Natural Resources, one of the most productive West Texas producers, has slashed the number of days to drill and complete wells so drastically that it has been able to cut costs by 25 percent in wells completed since early 2015. The typical rig that drilled eight to 12 wells a year just a few years ago now drills up to 16. Last year, the company added nearly 240 wells to its Permian Basin inventory without adding new employees.  Photo        Ryan Grant is a control room operator for Pioneer Natural Resources in Midland, helping manage all of the companys drilling sites in 21st-century style.   Credit Ilana Panich-Linsman for The New York Times    The faster operations, Pioneer executives say, are due in large part to more effective well planning and drill steering. Both have been made possible by the real-time computer connections between the rig and top geoscientists back at corporate headquarters and intense analysis of the data gathered at every well. The laborious task of checking tank levels by climbing a flight of steps and popping open a series of latches, for instance, has been replaced by pressing a few icons on a computer touch screen. A fully automated water pump station installed last summer is intended to save hundreds of truck trips every day hauling water for hydraulically fracturing wells, yielding diesel and labor cost savings. We want to transform our work force to the point where we need to hire fewer people, said Joey Hall, Pioneers executive vice president for Permian operations. Improved computing streamlines operations, he noted, and lets technicians optimally space their wells and more accurately perforate the sweet spots of shale veins to squeeze every drop of oil out of the ground. Were heading toward artificial intelligence and machine learning, analyzing thousands of algorithms, Mr. Hall added, sounding more like a Silicon Valley futurologist than a wildcatter. Through repetitive operations, you learn the patterns, and through patterns you learn to make automated decisions. With the loss of manual jobs has come a transformation in the job force, with demand growing for more data analysts, math scientists, communications specialists and robotic design engineers. In the last two years, ABB, the Swiss technology company, has opened two plants in Houston for assembling and packaging robotics and integrating advanced instrumentation into oil field operations.

Among its many projects is an experiment to use drones to inspect equipment and identify methane leaks on oil sites. Nabors, the oil services giant, has 100 employees developing software, 10 times the number it had only a few years ago.

Smith, a Nabors vice president. A typical new oil company employee is Andre Nel, a 25-year-old mechanical engineer who is a rising star at Pioneer Natural Resources. In less than two years, he has helped rewrite computer software to instruct workers on the best designs for hydraulic fracturing, optimizing the amounts of fluids, sand and chemicals pumped into the wells. Now, connected by computers to technicians in the field, he is monitoring the production of 950 wells, instantly checking the maintenance history and production trends of every well with the click of a mouse. Im lucky and happy that the tech revolution in the oil field has created the need for engineers like me with backgrounds in computer science, he said.

Their rig, two years old, requires a smaller crew than in the past.   Credit Ilana Panich-Linsman for The New York Times    But smaller companies and their workers are struggling to keep up. S.O.C. Industries, a small local pump truck operator and chemical services provider, is forced to invest $100,000 a year to keep up with the computer programs and monitoring equipment its clients request. The added expenses are one reason the company has let go 15 of the 60 field workers employed three years ago. Another is that well operators that once hired five or six people on a drill site to mix chemicals and drilling fluids as well as clean up spills are now hiring only three as mechanization has sliced their drilling time in half. Some of the remaining S.O.C. employees are straining to keep up with new computerized pump truck monitors and GPS systems. Its a struggle, said Rodrigo Urias, 59, an S.O.C. truck driver, who for many years only had to look at a needle on a gauge to monitor flow pressures. Now he needs to reset computer screens, take work orders on a computer tablet and sometimes do algebraic calculations.

A college dropout, he knocked around from job to job before finding his way to the oil patch. Now, playing video games like Call of Duty and Mario Kart with his friends over the years has paid off, giving him the eye-hand coordination to monitor and operate the control panels and joy sticks that control the drilling rig. We do such a good job now, he said, were drilling ourselves out of a job.

Gen. H. R. McMaster is likely to change an organization chart that caused concern when it was released last month.   Credit Al Drago/The New York Times     WASHINGTON  Lt. Gen. H. R. McMaster, President Trumps new national security adviser, is considering a reorganization of the White House foreign policy team that would give him control of Homeland Security and guarantee full access to the military and intelligence agencies. Just days after arriving at the White House, Mr. McMaster is weighing changes to an organization chart that generated consternation when it was issued last month . One proposal under discussion would restore the director of national intelligence and the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff to full membership in a cabinet-level committee, according to two officials who discussed internal deliberations on the condition of anonymity. Another likely change would reincorporate the Homeland Security Council under the National Security Council , the way it was during the administration of President Barack Obama, the officials said. The decision to separate the Homeland Security staff, they said, was primarily a way to diminish the power of Mr. McMasters predecessor, Michael T. Flynn, who resigned last week . Now that Mr. Flynn is out and Mr. McMaster is in, both councils may report to him.

Bannon, the presidents chief strategist, who has played a major role in shaping foreign policy. Under the original organization plan last month, Mr. Bannon was invited to attend any National Security Council meeting led by the president and was made a regular member of the so-called principals committee of cabinet secretaries.  Continue reading the main story         Advertisement   Continue reading the main story       One senior official supportive of Mr. Bannons position said it would not change under any reorganization. Sean Spicer, the White House press secretary, said this week that Mr. McMaster would have full authority to organize his staff, but that any change in Mr. Bannons status would have to be approved by the president. Veterans of past administrations and members of Congress from both parties criticized the decision to put Mr. Bannon on the principals committee, saying that it risked injecting politics into national security. President George W. Bushs senior adviser, Karl Rove, was generally kept out of sensitive national security meetings. Mr. Obamas senior adviser, David Axelrod, attended some national security meetings but was not given formal status.     Graphic  Donald Trumps Cabinet Is Complete. Heres the Full List.  A list of appointees and nominees for top posts in the new administration.         OPEN Graphic      The White House said the concern about Mr. Bannons role was overblown. But Mr. Trump was surprised by the intensity of the blowback to the initial order, and complained that Mr. Flynn had not made him understand the significance of the changes or how they would be perceived, according to senior officials. The principals committee, led by the national security adviser, is the central body that decides foreign policy issues that do not go to the president and frames the choices for those that do. The organization chart issued last month said that the director of national intelligence and the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff would attend the committees meetings only where issues pertaining to their responsibilities and expertise are to be discussed. While the decision to give Mr. Bannon a seat was a conscious one, Mr. Trumps team did not intend to reduce the role of the intelligence director or Joint Chiefs chairman, officials said. In crafting their organization order, the officials said, Mr. Trumps aides essentially cut and pasted language from Mr. Bushs organization chart, substituting the national intelligence director for the C.I.A. director, who back then was the head of the nations spy agencies.

As a practical matter, Mr. Trumps aides may not have intended a substantive change, but the political symbolism of elevating Mr. Bannon while seemingly demoting military and intelligence leaders was an immediate distraction. Even before Mr. McMasters appointment, White House officials were talking about revising the organization chart. The issue came to a head after Mr. Trump asked for Mr. Flynns resignation last week because Mr. Flynn had misled Vice President Mike Pence and other White House officials about what he discussed with Russias ambassador in a December phone call.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   Under Mr. Flynn, the National Security Council staff, composed largely of career professionals, was unsettled by the new administration. Staff members privately complained that they were shut out of meetings on their areas of responsibility and were not fully informed about the presidents policies or communications with foreign leaders. Some said they feared that their telephone calls or emails were being monitored. For its part, Mr. Trumps team suspected the staff members of leaking information to sabotage the new presidents plans. While Mr. McMaster has little experience in Washington, his appointment has been welcomed on both sides of the political aisle as a sign of a more pragmatic and less ideological national security team. Since arriving this week, Mr. McMaster has made a point of going door to door through the Eisenhower Executive Office Building, where most national security aides work, to introduce himself and build relations, current and former officials said. He is planning an all-hands staff meeting on Thursday.   Follow Peter Baker at @peterbakernyt. Maggie Haberman contributed reporting from New York, and Eric Schmitt and David E.

Credit Andrew Renneisen for The New York Times              The Future of Not Working  As automation reduces the need for human labor, some Silicon Valley executives think a universal income will be the answer  and the beta test is happening in Kenya.   By ANNIE LOWREY FEB. 23, 2017          The village is poor, even by the standards of rural Kenya. To get there, you follow a power line along a series of unmarked roads. Eventually, that power line connects to the school at the center of town, the sole building with electricity. Homesteads fan out into the hilly bramble, connected by rugged paths. There is just one working water tap, requiring many local women to gather water from a pit in jerrycans. There is no plumbing, and some families still practice open defecation, lacking the resources to dig a latrine. There arent even oxen strong enough to pull a plow, meaning that most farming is still done by hand. The village is poor enough that it is considered rude to eat in public, which is seen as boasting that you have food. In October, I visited Kennedy Aswan Abagi, the village chief, at his small red-earth home, decorated with posters celebrating the death of Osama bin Laden and the lives of African heroes, including JaKogelo, or the man from Kogelo, as locals refer to former President Barack Obama. Kogelo, where Obamas father was born, is just 20 miles from the village, which lies close to the banks of Lake Victoria. Abagi told me about the day his towns fate changed. It happened during the summer, when field officers from an American nonprofit called GiveDirectly paid a visit, making an unbelievable promise: They wanted to give everyone money, no strings attached. I asked, Why this village?  Abagi recalled, but he never got a clear answer, or one that made much sense to him. The villagers had seen Western aid groups come through before, sure, but nearly all of them brought stuff, not money. And because many of these organizations were religious, their gifts came with moral impositions; I was told that one declined to help a young mother whose child was born out of wedlock, for example. With little sense of who would get what and how and from whom and why, rumors blossomed. One villager heard that GiveDirectly would kidnap children. Some thought that the organization was aligned with the Illuminati, or that it would blight the village with giant snakes, or that it performed blood magic. Others heard that the money was coming from Obama himself. But the confusion faded that unseasonably cool morning in October, when a GiveDirectly team returned to explain themselves during a town meeting. Nearly all of the villages 220 people crowded into a blue-and-white tent placed near the school building, watching nervously as 13 strangers, a few of them white, sat on plastic chairs opposite them. Lydia Tala, a Kenyan GiveDirectly staff member, got up to address the group in Dholuo. She spoke at a deliberate pace, awaiting a hum and a nod from the crowd before she moved on: These visitors are from GiveDirectly. GiveDirectly is a nongovernmental organization that is not affiliated with any political party. GiveDirectly is based in the United States. GiveDirectly works with mobile phones. Each person must have his or her own mobile phone, and they must keep their PIN secret. Nobody must involve themselves in criminal activity or terrorism. This went on for nearly two hours. The children were growing restless.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   Finally, Tala passed the microphone to her colleague, Brian Ouma. People of the village, he said, are you happy?

Credit Andrew Renneisen for The New York Times        We are! they cried in unison. Then he laid out the particulars. Every registered person will receive 2,280 shillings  about $22  each and every month. You hear me? The audience gasped and burst into wild applause. Every person we register here will receive the money, I said  2,280 shillings! Every month. This money, you will get for the next 12 years. How many years?  Continue reading the main story         Advertisement   Continue reading the main story        Twelve years! Just like that, with peals of ululation and children breaking into dance in front of the strangers, the whole village was lifted out of extreme poverty. (I have agreed to withhold its name out of concern for the villagers safety.) The nonprofit is in the process of registering roughly 40 more villages with a total of 6,000 adult residents, giving those people a guaranteed, 12-year-long, poverty-ending income. An additional 80 villages, with 11,500 residents all together, will receive a two-year basic income. With this initiative, GiveDirectly  with an office in New York and funded in no small part by Silicon Valley  is starting the worlds first true test of a universal basic income. The idea is perhaps most in vogue in chilly, left-leaning places, among them Canada, Finland, the Netherlands and Scotland. But many economists think it might have the most promise in places with poorer populations, like India and sub-Saharan Africa. GiveDirectly wants to show the world that a basic income is a cheap, scalable way to aid the poorest people on the planet. We have the resources to eliminate extreme poverty this year, Michael Faye, a founder of GiveDirectly, told me. But these resources are often misallocated or wasted. His nonprofit wants to upend incumbent charities, offering major donors a platform to push money to the worlds neediest immediately and practically without cost. What happens in this village has the potential to transform foreign-aid institutions, but its effects might also be felt closer to home. A growing crowd, including many of GiveDirectlys backers in Silicon Valley, are looking at this pilot project not just as a means of charity but also as the groundwork for an argument that a universal basic income might be right for you, me and everyone else around the world too. The basic or guaranteed income is a curious piece of intellectual flotsam that has washed ashore several times in the past half-millennium, often during periods of great economic upheaval. In Utopia, published in 1516, Thomas More suggests it as a way to help feudal farmers hurt by the conversion of common land for public use into private land for commercial use. In Agrarian Justice, published in 1797, Thomas Paine supports it for similar reasons, as compensation for the loss of his or her natural inheritance, by the introduction of the system of landed property. It reappears in the writings of French radicals, of Bertrand Russell, of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.   The Future of Work        The Future of Work    01 The New Working Class  02 Automation Nation  03 Realizing a Universal Income  Meet the Workers  05 Does Retraining Work?            Silicon Valley has recently become obsessed with basic income for reasons simultaneously generous and self-interested, as a palliative for the societal turbulence its inventions might unleash. Many technologists believe we are living at the precipice of an artificial-intelligence revolution that could vault humanity into a postwork future. In the past few years, artificially intelligent systems have become proficient at a startling number of tasks, from reading cancer scans to piloting a car to summarizing a sports game to translating prose. Any job that can be broken down into discrete, repeatable tasks  financial analytics, marketing, legal work  could be automated out of existence. In this vision of the future, our economy could turn into a funhouse-mirror version of itself: extreme income and wealth inequality, rising poverty, mass unemployment, a shrinking prime-age labor force. It would be more George Saunders than George Jetson. But what does this all have to do with a small village in Kenya?   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   A universal basic income has thus far lacked what tech folks might call a proof of concept. There have been a handful of experiments, including ones in Canada, India and Namibia. Finland is sending money to unemployed people, and the Dutch city Utrecht is doing a trial run, too. But no experiment has been truly complete, studying what happens when you give a whole community money for an extended period of time  when nobody has to worry where his or her next meal is coming from or fear the loss of a job or the birth of a child. And so, the tech industry is getting behind GiveDirectly and other organizations testing the idea out. Chris Hughes, a Facebook founder and briefly the owner of The New Republic, has started a $10 million, two-year initiative to explore the viability of a basic income. (He has also been a major donor to GiveDirectly.) The research wing of Sam Altmans start-up incubator, Y Combinator, is planning to pass out money to 1,000 families in California and another yet-to-be-determined state. Then there is GiveDirectly itself, which has attracted $24 million in donations for its basic-income effort, including money from founders of Facebook, Instagram, eBay and a number of other Silicon Valley companies. Many donors I spoke with cited their interest in the project as purely philanthropic. But others saw it as a chance to learn more about a universal basic income, a way to prove that it could work and a chance to show people the human face of a hypothetical policy fix. In December, Altman, the 31-year-old president of Y Combinator, spoke at an anti-poverty event hosted by Stanford, the White House and the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative, the charitable institution the Facebook billionaire founded with his wife, Priscilla. Altman discussed the potential for basic income to alleviate poverty, but his speech veered back to the dark questions that hang over all this philanthropy: Is Silicon Valley about to put the world out of work? And if so, do technologists owe the world a solution?  Continue reading the main story        Photo        Caroline Akinyi Odhiambo wanted to buy iron sheets for her roof and then maybe pay her dowry.   Credit Andrew Renneisen for The New York Times        There have been these moments where we have had these major technology revolutions  the Agricultural Revolution, the Industrial Revolution, for example  that have really changed the world in a big way, Altman said. I think were in the middle or at least on the cusp of another one. GiveDirectly may be a charity, but it speaks in the argot of Silicon Valley. It is a platform, connecting donors and recipients, that prides itself on low overhead and superior analytics. It disdains what it sees as the bloated, expensive, stuck-in-their-ways incumbents that dominate the nonprofit space. And it even has a privileged bootstrapping creation story, beginning with its 20-something founders batting the idea around in Harvard Square academic buildings and scraping together money from friends. The idea for the nonprofit came to Michael Faye and Paul Niehaus, who is now a professor of economics at the University of California, San Diego, when they were graduate students at Harvard. Both were studying development and doing fieldwork overseas, an experience that underlined an Economics 101 lesson: Cash was more valuable to its recipients than the in-kind gifts commonly distributed by aid groups, like food or bed nets or sports equipment. If youre hungry, you cannot eat a bed net. If your village is suffering from endemic diarrhea, soccer balls wont be worth much to you. Once youve been there, its hard to imagine doing anything but cash, Faye told me. Its so deeply uncomfortable to ask someone if they want cash or something else. They look at you like its a trick question. But at the time, distributing cash aid in a country with little to no banking infrastructure outside major cities would have required an extraordinary amount of manpower, not to mention introducing the risk of robbery and graft. But dirt-cheap mobile phones with pay-as-you-go minutes began flooding into sub-Saharan African markets in the 2000s. Enterprising Ghanaians, Kenyans and Nigerians started to use their minutes as a kind of currency. In 2007, Vodafone and the British Department for International Development together built a system, called M-Pesa, for Kenyans to transfer actual shillings from cellphone to cellphone. An estimated 96 percent of Kenyan households use the system today. Faye and Niehaus  along with their friends Rohit Wanchoo and Jeremy Shapiro, also graduate students  thought about setting up a website to raise cash in the United States and send it directly to poor Kenyans. But they never found a nonprofit that would distribute that cash abroad. They decided to do it themselves in 2008. Because it was a start-up, and we started in grad school, Faye said, we were open to the idea of it being wrong or failing.           The following year, Faye traveled to small Kenyan villages during the summer break, offering cash to whoever seemed poor and would take it. (The money, about $5,000, came out of the foursomes own pockets.) That, surprisingly, worked well enough to give them the confidence to start a threadbare randomized control trial the year they graduated. It found that the recipients, who received an average of $500, saw excellent outcomes: Their children were 42 percent less likely to go a whole day without eating. Domestic-violence rates dropped, and mental health improved.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   In time, the nonprofit attracted the attention of Silicon Valley and its deep-pocketed young philanthropists. Two Facebook founders gave six-figure donations. Then, in the spring of 2012, Faye went to a friends brunch in Brooklyn and met someone working for Google.org, the tech giants giving arm. She liked the sound of GiveDirectly and arranged for Faye and Niehaus to give a presentation at Googles headquarters in Mountain View, Calif. The company ended up contributing $2.4 million. At first, GiveDirectly handed out large lump sums, generally $1,000 spread into three payments over the course of the year. The nonprofits field officers would locate low-income villages in Kenya, then find the poorest families in each individual village using a simple asset test (whether a family had a thatched roof or not). The field officers would introduce themselves to the town elders, explain their purpose and return to provide mobile phones and training to recipient families. Then GiveDirectly would push a button and send the money out. On a steaming October morning, I went with two GiveDirectly executives, Joanna Macrae and Ian Bassin, to visit one of the villages that had received GiveDirectlys lump-sum payments. We took off at dawn from Kisumu, a bustling industrial city on the banks of Lake Victoria, and followed a two-lane highway to Bondo, a small trading city filled with cattle, bicycles and roadside food stands. From there, we turned inland from the lake and drove into a lush agricultural region. The residents of this village had received money in 2013, and it was visibly better off than the basic-income pilot village. Its clearings were filled with mango plantings, its cows sturdy. A small lake on the outskirts had been lined with nets for catching fish. Could you imagine sitting in an office in London or New York trying to figure out what this village needs? Bassin said as he admired a well-fed cow tied up by the lakeside. It would just be impossible.  Continue reading the main story        Photo        Bethwel Onyando, a field officer for GiveDirectly, meeting with villagers.   Credit Andrew Renneisen for The New York Times        Perhaps, but delivering money by M-Pesa has some downsides, too. We visited an older woman named Anjelina Akoth Ngalo, her joints painful and swollen with advanced malaria. Sitting in her thatched-roof hut, she told us that she had received only one payment, not the three that she was promised. She had given her phone to a woman in a nearby village who transferred the money out of it. Ngalo visited the village elder to try to get her money back, but nothing had come of it. She was now destitute, living on about $5 a week. She had not eaten since the day before, and she had run out of malaria medication. (Bassin said that less than 1 percent of recipients experience theft, crime or conflict.) By giving money to some but not all, the organization had unwittingly strained the social fabric of some of these tight-knit tribal communities. One man we visited in a separate village nearby, Nicolus Owuor Otin, had acted as a liaison between the community and the GiveDirectly staff, showing them where different families houses were, for instance. For that reason, he said, the other villagers thought he was determining who would get what and threatened to burn his house down. Still, nearly all the recipients described the money as transformative. Fredrick Omondi Auma  a Burning Spear devotee wearing a Rasta-style hat and bell bottoms when we visited  had been impoverished, drinking too much, abandoned by his wife and living in a mud hut when GiveDirectly knocked on his door. He used his money to buy a motorbike to give taxi rides. He also started a small business, selling soap, salt and paraffin in a local town center; he bought two cows, one of which had given birth; and he opened a barbershop in the coastal city Mombasa. His income had gone from 600 shillings a week to 2,500 shillings  roughly $25, a princely sum for the area. His wife had returned. He had even stopped drinking as much. I used to go out drinking with 1,000 shillings, and Id wake up in the bar with 100 shillings, he said. Now I go out drinking with 1,000 shillings, and I wake up at home with 900.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   I didnt imagine I would be living in an iron-sheet house, he said, referring to his roof. I didnt imagine Id be wearing nice shoes. I didnt imagine I would have a business, and earnings from it. I didnt imagine I would be a man who owns cattle. Many popular forms of aid have been shown to work abysmally. PlayPumps  merry-go-round-type contraptions that let children pump water from underground wells as they play  did little to improve access to clean water. Buy-a-cow programs have saddled families with animals inappropriate to their environment. Skills training and microfinance, one 2015 World Bank study found, have shown little impact on poverty or stability, especially relative to program cost.           All across the villages of western Kenya, it was clear to me just how much aid money was wasted on unnecessary stuff. The villagers had too many jerrycans and water tanks, because a nongovernmental organization kept bringing them. There was a thriving trade in Toms canvas slip-ons: People received them free from NGO workers and then turned around and sold them in the market centers. And none of the aid groups that had visited the villages managed to help the very poorest families. In the pilot-project village, for example, Faye and I paid a visit to a woman named Caroline Akinyi Odhiambo, who lives in a mud hut on the edge of town with her husband, Jack, a laborer, and her two small children. The most expensive thing she ever bought, she told me, was a chicken for 500 shillings, or about $5. Her family was persistently hungry. She knew of three nonprofit groups that had helped the village before GiveDirectly. One aided families with school fees, but it chose not to help her children. I do not want to talk about it, she said. What is worse, Faye told me, walking away from Odhiambos hut, was that most nonprofit projects in the region were never subject to anything like an impact assessment, either. There is no way to know how well they are working, or whether that money would be better spent on something else. The question should always be: Would we be better off just giving this money away as cash? Faye said. There usually is not a way to answer that question. A vast majority of aid  94 percent  is noncash. Donor resistance is one reason for this; it is not easy to persuade American oligarchs, British inheritors and Japanese industrialists to fork over their money to the extremely poor to use as they see fit. Theres the usual worries about welfare dependency, the whole Give a man a fish thing, said Amanda Glassman, a public health and development expert at the Center for Global Development. Its so powerful. Its really a basic psychological feature of the landscape. Youll start drinking. Youll start lying around at home because youre getting paid. Cash also seems harder to market. American taxpayers might be perfectly happy to fund education for young women in poor countries or vaccinations for schoolchildren. But they might balk at the idea of showering money on poor, unstable countries. The visual of putting a pill in a kids mouth is so much more attractive to people, Glassman said.

Credit Andrew Renneisen for The New York Times        Institutional inertia is another factor. There are a lot of good people working in the system, Niehaus said. And there are a lot of organizations pushing to do cash transfers. But the way they are structured and incentivized from the top down  they arent structured to do it. They have a specific mandate, like health. Cash transfers give choice of what goal to pursue to the recipients.

Its easy to muster evidence that you should be giving cash instead of fertilizer, said Justin Sandefur of the Center for Global Development. The harder argument is: You should shut down your U.S.A.I.D. program, which is bigger than the education budget of Liberia, and give the money to Liberians. Thats the radical critique. Faye put it more bluntly, if half-jokingly: If cash transfers flourished, the whole aid industry would have to fire itself. There is something to that. One estimate, generated by Laurence Chandy and Brina Seidel of the Brookings Institution, recently calculated that the global poverty gap  meaning how much it would take to get everyone above the poverty line  was just $66 billion. That is roughly what Americans spend on lottery tickets every year, and it is about half of what the world spends on foreign aid. In the pilot-project village, the residents had just started to work through how transformative the program would be, what they could do with the money and how different their lives could feel in 12 years. Detractors often say that no one would work in a world with a basic income, that the safety net could grow a bit too comfortable. Ultimately, what a universal income would do to workers in the rich world will remain a mystery until someone tries it out. But here, many villagers were concerned primarily with procuring the sustenance and basic comforts that their penury had denied them. Odhiambo, the woman who had not been offered aid by the school group, planned to buy corrugated iron sheets for her roof; she considered possibly paying off her dowry. Another villager, Pamela Aooko Odero, ran a household that had been suffering from hunger, with all eight of them living on just 500 to 1,000 shillings a week. She took her money as soon as she got it and went to buy food. Many more made plans that were entrepreneurial. Two widowed sister-wives, Margaret Aloma Abagi and Mary Abonyo Abagi, told me they planned to pool their funds together to start a small bank with some friends. Charles Omari Ager, a houseboy for the sister-wives, had his phone turned off and wrapped in a plastic bag in his pocket when the first text came in. He was driving the widows goats and cattle from one dried-out, bramble-filled meadow to another when he happened upon an aid worker, who prompted him to pull out his phone, turn it on and wait. The text was there. The money was there. Im happy! Im happy! Im happy! he said. He bought himself a goat that day. When he got his money, Erick Odhiambo Madoho walked to the cow-dotted local highway nearest the village and took a matatu , a shared minibus, overloaded with 20 passengers, down to Lake Victoria. There he found an M-Pesa stand and converted his mobile money into shillings. He used the cash to buy the first of three rounds of filament-thin fishing line that he would need to hand-knot into nets to catch tilapia in the lake.   When the nets were done, he told me, he would rent a boat and hire a day laborer to work with him. He anticipated that his income, after costs, might reach as much as 2,000 shillings on a good day. I asked him why he hadnt saved money for nets beforehand. He shrugged, smiled and said, I could not.

Germans are fleeing their country, fearful of Muslim refugees. The Swedish government supports the Islamic State. The European Union has drafted rules to regulate the ethnicity of snowmen. In their open-plan office overlooking a major thoroughfare in Brussels, an 11-person team known as East Stratcom , serves as Europes front line against this onslaught of fake news. Created by the European Union to address Russias ongoing disinformation campaigns, the team  composed of diplomats, bureaucrats and former journalists  tracks down reports to determine whether they are fake. Then, it debunks the stories for hapless readers. In the 16 months since the team has been on the job, it has discredited 2,500 stories, many with links to Russia .   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   In a year when the French, Germans and Dutch will elect leaders, the European authorities are scrambling to counter a rising tide of fake news and anti-European Union propaganda aimed at destabilizing peoples trust in institutions.  Continue reading the main story         Advertisement   Continue reading the main story       As officials play catch-up in the fight against sophisticated hacking and fake news operations, they fear Europe and its elections remain vulnerable at a critical moment: The regions decades-old project of unity hangs in the balance, challenged by populist forces within the bloc and pressures from Russia and beyond. If you look at how European media, and even big American media, are covering the issue now, I would say that it is those few people on that team who have been able to raise awareness, said Jakub Janda, a deputy director with European Values, a think tank based in Prague, who has worked with East Stratcom. Many false claims target politicians who present the biggest obstacles to Moscows goal of undermining the European Union. Others seek to portray refugees from the Middle East as terrorists or rapists, fomenting populist anger. In France, the head of the En Marche! party said last week that Russian news channels had targeted the presidential candidate Emmanuel Macron, who belongs to the party and is running on a pro-European Union platform. Richard Ferrand, the partys secretary-general, said the campaigns databases and websites had been hit by hundreds, if not thousands, of attacks from inside Russia. The East Stratcom team is the first to admit that it is outgunned: The task is overwhelming, the volume of reports immense, the support to combat them scant. The team tries to debunk bogus items in real time on Facebook and Twitter and publishes daily reports and a weekly newsletter on fake stories to its more than 12,000 followers on social media. But its list of 2,500 fake reports is small compared with the daily churn across social media. Catching every fake news story would be nearly impossible, and the fake reports the team does combat routinely get a lot more viewers than its myth-busting efforts.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   East Stratcom is purely a communications exercise. Still, team members, most of whom speak Russian, have received death threats, and a Czech member of the team has twice been accused on Russian television of espionage. The team in Brussels is not the only force in Europe fighting the problem. Similar groups are being created from Finland to the Czech Republic to disprove online hoaxes, state agencies are improving online security to counter potential hacking attacks and European news media outlets are expanding fact-checking teams to counter false reports. One of the biggest problems policy makers across Europe say they face is a lack of tech specialists. Germany recently passed a cybersecurity law that called for a rapid response team to combat hacking attacks. Officials quietly acknowledged, though, that they would need three teams, if they could only find people to staff them. There are concerns shared by many governments that fake news could become weaponized, said Damian Collins, a British politician in charge of a new parliamentary investigation examining the phenomenon. The spread of this type of material could eventually undermine our democratic institutions.

Credit Dmitry Kostyukov for The New York Times    Despite the regionwide push to counter false reports, experts question whether such fact-checking efforts by governments and publishers will have a meaningful effect. Fake reports can easily be shared through social media with few, if any, checks for accuracy. Most people just dont care about where their news comes from, said Mark Deuze, a professor at the University of Amsterdam. He added that nep news, Dutch for fake news, has been growing ahead of the countrys national elections next month. People are exposed to a ridiculous amount of information online. Officials are also anxious about hackers attempts to infiltrate the email accounts of candidates and politicians to steal compromising information.

In Germany, where Chancellor Angela Merkel is facing tough competition ahead of elections in September, the countrys domestic intelligence service already has reported a sharp rise in so-called phishing attacks in recent months aimed at political parties and members of the countrys Parliament.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   They attribute these efforts to the hacking group known as Fancy Bear, or APT 28, which American intelligence agencies linked to the hacking of the Democratic National Committee before the presidential election. Both American and German intelligence officials believe the group is operated by the G.R.U., the Russian military intelligence service. The German government is weighing potential hefty fines for tech giants like Google and Facebook, whose platforms allow false stories to be quickly circulated. The companies insist that they cannot be held responsible because they do not generate the stories. Hans-Georg Maassen, the head of Germanys domestic intelligence service, said that although there was no smoking gun, Russia was likely to be involved in the increase in online misinformation aimed at destabilizing German politics. What makes cyberattacks so sexy for foreign powers is that it is nearly impossible to find a smoking gun, Mr. Maassen said in an interview with Phoenix TV Feb. 12. It is always possible to cover your tracks and operate undercover. American tech giants also have stepped in after they were accused of not doing enough to counter false reports on their platforms, accusations that Facebook, Google and other companies deny. They are now funding initiatives in the United States, France and elsewhere to flag fake news online and remove posts if they are found to violate companies terms of use or local laws. This isnt just about debunking falsehoods, said Jenni Sargent, the managing director of First Draft News , a nonprofit that is partly funded by Google and expanding rapidly in France ahead of the countrys elections, as well as across Europe and beyond. What were trying to do is to deal with the content as opposed to the source. Such efforts across Europe have gained momentum since the United States presidential election. Soon after Donald J. Trumps victory in November, David Alandete gathered his team in the El Pais newsroom in downtown Madrid with one goal in mind: to respond to fake news. Like many journalists, Mr. Alandete, the Spanish newspapers managing editor and a former United States correspondent, had seen waves of false reports during the presidential campaign, many directed at Mexico  a country that accounts for roughly half of El Pais online readership.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   Trump winning was a major turning point for us, Mr. Alandete said. Many of our readers were asking whether they could even travel to the States. Populist parties and distrust of traditional news media outlets have been growing in Spain, like other cash-strapped European countries. Such movements have spurred an explosion of fake or misleading news, aimed at either promoting certain political views or undermining others credibility. To counter such reports  and, in part, to cater to its Mexican readers  El Pais began expanding its fact-checking efforts late last year. That includes assigning five more reporters to debunk false reports online and starting a blog , called Hechos, or facts in Spanish, to dispel the worst offenders. Not all of El Paiss myth-busting targets, though, have been about politics. In its first blog post , published last month, the newspapers reporters reviewed false claims that the Portuguese soccer star Cristiano Ronaldo had abandoned his sports car after hurting one of his hands while driving. The post, according to Mr. Alandete, was viewed more than 200,000 times  making it one of El Paiss most-read online articles that week. Many people dont trust institutions anymore, Mr. Alandete said. We see fake news coming from everywhere.   Follow Mark Scott @markscott82 and Melissa Eddy @meddynyt on Twitter. Benoit Morenne contributed reporting from Paris.

Credit Film Desk     Few films elicit as many satisfyingly divergent responses as Les Hautes Solitudes. By turns alluring and alienating, and wholly silent, it was made in 1974 by the French director Philippe Garrel and is receiving its belated New York theatrical release at the Metrograph. Experimental by design, though perhaps a bit by accident, it mostly consists of images of the American actress Jean Seberg , who, after her debut as a celluloid saint in Saint Joan, went off to peddle papers and make love to Jean-Paul Belmondo in Jean-Luc Godards  Breathless . By the time Seberg made Les Hautes Solitudes, her most famous roles were behind her; five years later, she was dead from an apparent suicide. Here, Seberg makes love only to the camera, though she often seems averse to or exasperated by its attentions. Or is she despairing or depressed? Its impossible to know, and neither she nor the film says. Les Hautes Solitudes isnt only silent (no audible dialogue, no music), it also has no explanatory text of any kind (subtitles included) or opening and closing credits. Instead there are faces, most female, beautiful and on the young side. The first belongs to the German singer Nico, Mr. Garrels onetime companion, whos best known for chanteusing with the Velvet Underground. The title of one of their lovely dirges,  Ill Be Your Mirror , could serve as a tagline for Les Hautes Solitudes. Other beauties come and go in Les Hautes Solitudes, principally the American actress Tina Aumont , a feral stunner with slashing cheekbones, whose dark mane creates a sharply chromatic contrast with Sebergs blondness. Here and there are also shots of the French actor Laurent Terzieff, who appears, Narcissus-like, gazing at his reflection. Mostly the camera looks at Seberg, who looks right back at it, though sometimes away from it, too, glancing up or down or sideways. Occasionally, the close-ups are tight enough that her face looms; at other times, she is framed in a head-and-shoulders shot, much like a classical Greek bust. Every so often, she lies in bed or crouches in a corner. While these images seem to reveal all, they disclose nothing beneath the surface. All that we know is what we see onscreen and that Sebergs face is delicate and lightly creased. Shes rarely shown smiling, although there are instances when she laughs emphatically, moments that feel uncomfortable and artificial, as if she were trying out an emotion she had forgotten. We know the texture of her skin; the patterns on the walls; the depth of field; the quality of the light; the contrast of the black-and-white film; the level of grain; the dowdiness of her clothes. Shes partial to granny dresses, or maybe theyre nightgowns, and when she stands in front of a window, the sunlight glows softly, creating a kind of ravishing halo effect: Saint Jean. The films silence works as a kind of invitation, encouraging you to infer meaning and jump to conclusions as one image gives way to the next. You fill in the gaps between them, a process similar to how viewers create meaning through montage, shot by shot. The images in Les Hautes Solitudes, though, seem more casually strung together than assembled for specific meanings. That makes sense. In 2011 Mr. Garrel told the French magazine Les Inrocks that the idea was to make a film out of the outtakes of a film that never existed in the first place. One of the pleasures of Les Hautes Solitudes is that it encourages you to take up filmmaking, as you write that nonexistent movie in your head.

Denmark has been struggling to maintain Danish identity while integrating immigrants cultures.   Credit Ilvy Njiokiktjien for The New York Times     The Danish government has been inadvertently paying benefits to citizens fighting for the Islamic State in Syria, Danish officials said Tuesday, as outrage grows that militants are manipulating the countrys generous welfare system. About 145 Danes have traveled to Syria or Iraq to fight for militant groups since 2012, according to the Danish security and intelligence services. Officials said this week that they had identified a number of Danish citizens who, while receiving government disability pensions, had traveled to Syria to join the Islamic State, also known as ISIS . It is a huge scandal that we are paying out money from the welfare funds in Denmark to people who are going to Syria and elsewhere in the world to undermine democracy that we have been fighting for for hundreds of years, the countrys minister of labor, Troels Lund Poulsen , said.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   Last year, the news media reported that more than two dozen Danish citizens receiving unemployment benefits had traveled to Syria to fight for ISIS, even though the law requires recipients to live in Denmark.  Continue reading the main story         Advertisement   Continue reading the main story       Senior labor ministry officials said Tuesday that the center-right government of Prime Minister Lars Lokke Rasmussen was planning to pass legislation to plug loopholes and prevent what they called an egregious misuse of public funds. Officials said that since last year, municipal and state authorities had been trying to collect about $95,000 in welfare benefits that had been wrongly paid to 29 citizens who had gone to Syria to fight for ISIS. Until now, national regulations have made it difficult for the authorities to stop benefit payments to a suspected militant, even if the person had been identified by the intelligence services as an ISIS fighter. Officials said investigating the circumstances of individuals in Syria or Iraq was logistically challenging. Under the proposed legislation, any citizen deemed a national security risk after traveling abroad to join the Islamic State would have his or her benefits immediately halted, said Bent Nielsen, an official who oversees how welfare benefits are distributed. If someone is deemed to be a risk for state security by intelligence services while staying abroad, they wouldnt get a dime, Mr. Nielsen said. He added that, under the proposed legislation, once a Danish court determines that a citizen has violated the law and joined the Islamic State, then Danish authorities could also demand the reimbursement of benefits already paid.

More than a decade ago, Denmark became a flash point for Islamic extremism after a Danish newspaper published caricatures of the Prophet Muhammad, spurring outrage and protests across the Muslim world. In February 2015, Omar Abdel Hamid El-Hussein , a 22-year-old Danish-born gunman of Palestinian descent, killed two people while targeting a Copenhagen synagogue and an event promoting free speech. He was later shot dead by police. The efforts to tame Islamic radicalism in Denmark are occurring against the backdrop of a simmering culture war over Danish identity and the challenge of integrating immigrants, which has helped drive support for the far-right anti-immigrant Danish Peoples Party.

Parliament notes with concern that today there are areas in Denmark where the share of immigrants and descendants from non-Western countries surpasses 50 percent, the statement said. It is the opinion of the Parliament that Danes should not be a minority in neighborhoods in Denmark. The statement, which was largely symbolic but generated a loud debate, also called for the government to limit the granting of asylum. Opponents of the statement, which was supported by the government and its coalition partners and passed by a vote of 55-54, said it stigmatized Danish immigrants and citizens who were born of immigrant parents. The Danish Peoples Party also caused an outcry after its immigration spokesman, Martin Henriksen, suggested that Muslim refugees and immigrants should celebrate Christian festivals, including Christmas and Easter, if they wanted to be accepted as Danish . Also this month, another far-right, anti-immigrant group, the Party of the Danes, came under criticism after stuffing immigrants mailboxes in a suburb west of Copenhagen with fliers that looked like one-way airline tickets. The party is not in the Danish Parliament. The fake airline tickets showed a flight from Copenhagen to Langbortistan, which roughly translates to Faraway-istan. The tickets also included a message in Arabic: Have a good trip home.

Credit Al Drago/The New York Times     Much seemed familiar on Saturday as President Trump held his first campaign rally as president  the hats, the chants, and even some of the misstatements and exaggerations made by Mr. Trump. Mr. Trump compared himself to Thomas Jefferson and Abraham Lincoln, presidents who fought with the media and called them out. We are here today to speak the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, he said. But he then offered several misleading claims. Mr. Trump warned that refugees coming into the United States are not screened. Weve allowed thousands and thousands of people into our country. There was no way to vet those people. There was no documentation, there was no nothing. Refugees are vetted, and it takes two years. Mr. Trump repeatedly made this inaccurate claim during the 2016 campaign, and it is still inaccurate. The countrys vetting system for refugees , which begins at the United Nations, is extensive.

The system is not foolproof, and intelligence officials have raised concerns about gaps in data collection on people coming from conflict zones like Syria.  Continue reading the main story         Advertisement   Continue reading the main story       Mr. Trump claimed that Americans are optimistic about the future. Look at whats happening in every poll when it comes to optimism in our country. Some polls show optimism, others dont. In the immediate aftermath of Mr. Trumps election, the majority of voters expressed optimism about the next four years in several  respected  polls . But the results have varied in more recent months: 53 percent said they were optimistic in a Quinnipiac University poll , while 54 percent said they were pessimistic or uncertain in an NBC/Wall Street Journal poll . According to Gallups weekly economic optimism poll , Americans are slightly less confident in the economy in February than they were in January. In other Gallup polls, Mr. Trumps approval rating and Americans view of the countrys standing in the world are the lowest in decades. Mr. Trump extolled an increase in jobs. Jobs are already starting to pour back in. Theyre coming back in like you havent seen in a long time. Data shows modest gains so far. The economy added 227,000 jobs in January 2017, a healthy but less than record increase, more likely attributable to the ending days of the Obama administration than the incoming president. And the unemployment rate was little changed, remaining at 4.8 percent for January, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics . Thats 0.1 percent higher than it was the previous month. Mr. Trump alluded to high crime in Chicago and the country at large. Look at whats happening in Chicago  hundreds of shootings, hundreds of deaths. Ill tell you whats happening in Chicago, and many other places. Crime is high in Chicago, but it has generally declined. Mr. Trump warned of soaring levels of crime during the 2016 election, ignoring data. Chicago did experience a surge in homicides last year , with more than 750 people murdered. The countrys third-largest city, along with three other urban areas, contributed to a jump in the national murder rate in 2016. But over all, both violent crime and property crime have fallen since the early 1990s.

I have nothing to do with Russia, he told reporters. To the best of my knowledge, no person that I deal with does.   Credit Stephen Crowley/The New York Times     WASHINGTON  For months, President Trump and his aides have insisted that they had no contact with Russian officials during the presidential campaign, a denial Mr. Trump repeated last week. I have nothing to do with Russia, he told reporters on Thursday . To the best of my knowledge, no person that I deal with does. The denial stands at odds with statements by Russian officials, who have at least twice acknowledged contacts with aides to Mr. Trump before the election. It is not uncommon for a presidential campaign to speak to foreign officials, which makes the dispute particularly unusual. At the same time, any contacts would have taken place during a period when American intelligence agencies believe the Russian government was trying to disrupt the election with a campaign of computer hacking.

Ryabkov, the Russian deputy foreign minister, said his government had maintain ed contacts with members of Mr. Trumps immediate entourage during the campaign.

More recently, Russias ambassador to Washington, Sergey I. Kislyak, told The Washington Post that he had communicated frequently during the campaign with Michael T. Flynn, a close campaign adviser to Mr. Trump who became the presidents national security adviser before resigning from the position last week. Its something all diplomats do, The Post quoted Mr. Kislyak as saying, though he refused to say what subjects they discussed. Mr. Trump and his aides denied any contacts occurred during the campaign. This is a nonstory because to the best of our knowledge, no contacts took place, so its hard to make a comment on something that never happened, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, a White House spokeswoman, said on Monday. The Russian government did not respond to a message over the weekend seeking comment. Separately, The New York Times and other news outlets reported last week that Trump campaign advise rs and other associates of Mr. Trumps had repeated contacts last year with Russian intelligence officials. Those reports, citing anonymous current and former American government officials, were vigorously denied by the White House. On Thursday, Mr. Trump made clear his annoyance when questioned about contacts with Russia. How many times do I have to answer this question? Russia is a ruse. I have nothing to do with Russia, he said during a White House news conference.

Watch in Times Video          embed            Under ordinary circumstances, few in Washington would blink at the statements by Mr. Ryabkov or Mr. Kislyak. It is common for foreign governments to reach out to American presidential candidates, and many foreign diplomats believe it is part of their job to get to know people who may soon be crucial to maintaining alliances or repairing broken relationships. They want to better understand policy views of a particular candidate so they can perhaps make their case for certain policies, said Derek Chollet, who was part of the Obama transition in 2008 and then served in senior roles at the State Department, the White House and the Pentagon. Mostly, though, its about relationship building  they want to get to know the people who are possibly going to be in important jobs, he added. The closest contacts between campaigns and foreign officials tend to be with allies. The Australian Embassy said it was in contact with the Trump and Clinton campaigns, and British officials said they had extensive contacts with the presidents top aides in the months before the election. Contacts with potential adversaries, such as Russia, are also not unusual, but they are more complicated. Michael McFaul, who advised the Obama campaign in 2008 and later served as United States ambassador to Russia, said that he traveled to Moscow during the presidential race that year and that everyone in Moscow knew that I was advising the campaign. The American Embassy even hosted a lunch for him with Russian officials. But I was not there to discuss Obama policy but to better inform my views on Russian attitudes about U.S.-Russia relations, Mr. McFaul said. He said that during the transition, Russian officials wanted to talk about policy issues, but the Obama administration officials refused  in keeping with the tradition that there should be only one president at a time.   Correction: February 22, 2017   An article on Tuesday about statements from Russian officials regarding contacts with aides to President Trump before the election erroneously stated that Mr. Trump visited Israel during the campaign trip. While he did announce plans to visit, the trip was canceled.      Follow Matthew Rosenberg on Twitter @AllMattNYT .
