With multiple auctioneers frantically yelling out bids in multiple languages, Retromobile Week in Paris can sometimes sound like the broadcasters booth during a close finish at a Formula One Grand Prix. The Retromobile show, whose 42nd edition closed on Feb. 12, and its accompanying auctions are Frances premier events for anyone interested in buying, selling or simply admiring serious classic cars. Everybody comes, Jon A. Shirley , a collector of art and cars who is based in Seattle, said on the first of the four days of Retromobile. Its a chance to see all the great cars that are for sale in Europe and the U.K. in the one spot, added Mr. Shirley, a former president of Microsoft, whose collection of classic Ferraris includes a 1962 250 GTO , the worlds most valuable model of car, at up to $50 million. The presence of Mr. Shirley and other prominent American collectors such as Peter W. Mullin and S. Robson Walton showed that they had not been put off by the succession of recent terrorist attacks that deterred some long-haul fliers from visiting Continental Europe. Im not concerned, Mr. Shirley said.

The crowd was predominantly male and middle-aged, but this year, particularly at the accompanying auctions, younger buyers were increasingly influential players.

This year, it included an 1871 steam-driven motorcycle, a World War I French tank, vintage-style crash helmets and model 1960s Ferraris.

The Zurich dealer Lukas Huni pulled out all the stops with a cultural exhibition of 20 Bentley and Bugatti classics from collectors, including the Bentley Speed Six Old Number 2 that came second in the 24 Hours of Le Mans race in 1930 and one of just three 1936 Bugatti Type 57S Atlantic coupes. The Swiss dealership said that although none of the cars were officially for sale, owners might be open to discreet offers. The last Bugatti Atlantic to come on the market was bought in 2010 by Mr. Mullin for between $30 million and $40 million.  Photo        An Aston Martin display.

Credit Retromobile    Lower on the price scale, lAtelier des Coteaux , based in northeastern France, was representative of the dozens of smaller-scale dealerships plying their trade at Retromobile. This long-established French specialist said it sold eight cars at the show, the most expensive being a green 1971 Aston Martin DBS coupe priced at 325,000 euros, or $345,000. This was pretty standard, said Laurent Lefebvre, son of the dealerships founders, Marie-Christine and Oscar Lefebvre. But we were meeting new customers, people who have sold their businesses and who want to enjoy life and invest in classic cars. Their average age is not under 45. The aging demographic of the classic car world presents a challenge for a collecting field that in recent years has formed a reputation as a high-performing alternative investment. The Historic Auto Group International s index of the value of auction and dealer sales of the top 50 collectible cars increased 46.75 percent over 2013. Last month, this benchmark index was down 0.4 percent from December.

Theres less interest in prewar cars. People are more interested in modern Porsches. They appeal to a new generation of buyers. Yet select cars from the 1930s, if they have a distinguished history, still have their admirers. The top price at Bonhams was the 2 million with fees for an Aston Martin Ulster two-seater that participated in the 1935 Le Mans race. It had been estimated at 1.6 million to 1.8 million. More symptomatic of current trends was the sale for the same price (2 million) on Feb. 8 at RM Sothebys on the Place Vauban for a white 1988 Porsche 959 Sport, one of 29 built by the German marque. That coupe sold for its upper estimate, but an even rarer black 1994 Porsche 911 Turbo S  one of 17  climbed to 901,600 against a high pre-sale estimate of 750,000.  Photo        A Porsche. Modern Porsches hold appeal for many younger car collectors.   Credit RM Sotheby's    People are making money at a younger age than they ever have, said Oliver Camelin, a specialist in modern Porsches for RM Sothebys . We have clients aged 30 to 40, or even 20 to 30, he said, and they want to own the cars they had in posters on their teenage bedroom walls. (Of course, modern Porsches can also be a far more straightforward investment than are lovingly restored older cars, and therefore more appealing to younger collectors.) Artcurials Feb. 10 auction in the black-wall basement of Retromobile attracted a relatively huge crowd of about 3,000 people for its 154 lots. A sleek 1965 prototype for the iconic Ferrari Dino proved the most expensive auction car of the week, reaching 4.4 million with fees, near the low end of its pre-sale valuation. It was sold by a museum dedicated to the 24-hour race and had been exhibited at last years Retromobile.  Photo        Bidders were excited about a classic barn find in the form of a 1965 Citroen DS 19 Cabriolet.   Credit Artcurial    Predictably, there was rather more excited bidding for a classic barn find in the shape of a 1965 Citroen DS 19 Cabriolet that had been photographed next to hay bales and covered in bird droppings. Competition in the room pushed the price to 101,320, well above the estimates high end of 60,000. Dietrich Hatlapa, founder of the HAGI index, who was in Paris for the auctions, estimated that it would cost at least 150,000 to properly restore the Citroen. These cars will always trade for their purchase price plus restorations costs, he said. But even that might be a little optimistic in the case of this convertible, given that, at Bonhams, a restored 1964 version sold for 207,000 with fees.

Retromobile mounted an admired display of the super-powerful Group B cars that tore around country roads during the World Rally Championship from 1982 to 1986. A series of fatal accidents led to the category being banned.  Photo        The other talking point in Paris was the new demand for classic rally cars.   Credit Artcurial    All three of the Paris auctions offered these so-called Killer B cars, which can be raced in scarcely less dangerous historic rallies . Examples of the Renault 5 Turbo Group B, capable of a monstrous 300 brake horsepower, sold for 195,500 at Bonhams, 257,600 at RM Sothebys and 321,840 at Artcurial. The danger adds to their reputation, Mr. Hatlapa said. Theyre a cool racecar, and yet you can use them to get the paper in the morning. Neighbors would be well advised to stay indoors for that particular paper run.  Continue reading the main story        Were interested in your feedback on this page.

The idea would be simple, but not easy, requiring a wholesale reframing of the United States economy and housing market. The solution: Americans, together and all at once, would have to stop thinking about their homes as an investment. The virtues of homeownership are so ingrained in the American psyche that we often forget that housing is also a source of economic stress . Rising milk prices are regarded as a household tragedy for some, and spiking gas prices stoke national outrage. But whenever home prices go up, its a recovery, even though that recovery also means millions of people can no longer afford to buy . Homes are the largest asset for all but the richest households , but shelter is also a basic necessity, like food. We have a variety of state and federal programs devised to make housing cheaper and more accessible, and a maze of local land-use laws that make housing scarcer and more expensive by doing things like prohibiting in-law units, regulating how small lots can be, and capping the number of unrelated people who can live together.

That hampers economic growth, makes income inequality worse and keeps people from pursuing their dreams.  Photo        A surge in high-density apartment and condominium construction in downtown Los Angeles has helped to increase the citys supply of housing.   Credit Monica Almeida/The New York Times    So instead of looking at homes as investments, what if we regarded them like a TV or a car or any other consumer good? People might expect home prices to go down instead of up. Homebuilders would probably spend more time talking about technology and design than financing options. Politicians might start talking about their plans to lower home prices further, as they often do with fuel prices .  Continue reading the main story         Advertisement   Continue reading the main story       In this thought experiment, housing prices would probably adjust. They would be somewhat cheaper in most places, where population is growing slowly. But they would be profoundly cheaper in places like super-expensive San Francisco. That was the conclusion of a recent paper by the economists Ed Glaeser of Harvard and Joe Gyourko at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania. The paper uses construction industry data to determine how much a house should cost to build if land-use regulation were drastically cut back. Since the cost of erecting a home varies little from state to state  land is the main variable in housing costs  their measure is the closest thing we have to a national home price. According to them, a standard American home should cost around $200,000, a figure that includes the cost of construction, what land would cost in a lightly regulated market, and a modest profit for developers. In many places, thats what the prices roughly are. But for a few metropolitan areas like San Francisco and Boston, homes are wildly overpriced, leading to distortions in the economy and labor market. We would still see homes of different sizes and styles  condos in some places, single-family homes in others  depending on the market in each city. A New York home would be smaller than one in, say, Houston. And prices would still vary from place to place, based on demand and geography. Its easier to build in Phoenix (plenty of flat land), and harder in San Francisco (lots of hills and nearby water). But while building in the San Francisco metro area is more expensive than in other places, its not that expensive. By the papers calculations, a home in the San Francisco area should cost around $281,000. The actual price for a standard home in the area is more like $800,000 (using 2013 data). The paper argues that most of that difference is caused by regulatory hurdles like design and environmental reviews that can add years to a projects timeline and suppress the overall housing supply. The result is overpayment on a grand scale for the few homes that do get built.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   People are sure to quibble with the economists calculations, but their general conclusion  that an abundance of new homes would result in lower prices  is not remotely controversial. Many studies, from the McKinsey Global Institute , Californias Legislative Analysts Office and others, have shown that Californias high home prices are largely a supply problem: The state doesnt build enough homes. There are counterexamples around the world. Tokyo has not had rapid home price appreciation because increases in demand are met with increases in new building . So lets carry on with this hypothetical. Say we opened the floodgate of development. What kind of effects could we expect? The economy would grow, and by a lot. According to a recent paper by the economists Chang-Tai Hsieh, from the University of Chicagos Booth School of Business, and Enrico Moretti, from the University of California, Berkeley, local land-use regulations reduce the United States economic output by as much as $1.5 trillion a year, or about 10 percent lower than it could be. That is a theoretical figure that includes easy-to-see things like increased sales of building materials and more jobs for construction workers. Most of the increase, however, would come from more abstract gains like increased wages for people who are willing to move from an economically distressed city to a faster-growing economy elsewhere, but are currently unable to because housing is too expensive. Over time, the accelerated pace of building could lead to a long-run deflation in home values. But for the most part that would be limited to a few coastal cities. And while the older homeowners there would most likely be resentful of all the new apartments, condos and townhomes that caused their home equity to shrivel, younger people would have an easier time getting started.   Where Housing Costs Too Much  In the priciest United States metropolitan areas, land restrictions that cap new development have pushed prices much higher than they would be if land-use regulation were drastically cut back, according to a recent paper by two economists.

The impact on mobility could be huge, as the $1.5 trillion figure shows. There was a time, a few decades ago, when the cost of living did not vary all that much from city to city. Since then, as places like New York, San Francisco and Seattle have been hit with skyrocketing rents and home prices, the regional disparity in housing costs has altered how Americans of different incomes pursue opportunity . Back when home prices were more even from place to place, people with different levels of education and income tended to flock to the same types of high-wage places, according to research by Daniel Shoag, a professor of public policy at Harvard, and Peter Ganong of the University of Chicago.

Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   Thats because lower-income people have little to gain by going to Californias coastal cities. Wages might be higher, but as the states poverty figures show, a better paycheck doesnt help if its swallowed by rent. The loss of mobility makes income inequality worse, because lower-wage workers are effectively locked out of exactly those places where wages and the demand for workers are greatest. Finally, if housing were plentiful and cheap, we would probably stop having big housing bubbles. One good way of describing a speculative bubble is a moment when society deludes itself into believing that something plentiful is scarce, or will soon be. In the mid-2000s, banks and homeowners came to believe that homes would be scarce in places like Las Vegas and Phoenix, even though there were enough materials, land and labor to keep building and building and building. Housing is particularly prone to bubbles because, in contrast with other products, we seem to want it more when it is expensive and less when it is cheap. And no matter how many times we look out an airplane window to see vast acres of emptiness, we somehow still believe that land is a great investment because nobody is making more of it. Homes would still hold a lot of value; they still might appreciate, if more slowly; and desirable neighborhoods would still seem relatively expensive. But there would probably be fewer manias in which people expect home prices to double in just a few years. Just as we dont expect to make a profit selling our cars, if we stopped thinking of our homes as big moneymakers, we would probably start focusing on building them faster and less expensively.  Photo      Jeff Wilson, who refers to himself as Professor Dumpster, inside one of his prototype homes. He runs a company, Kasita, that wants to build modular housing in overpriced U.S. cities.   Credit Ilana Panich-Linsman for The New York Times    Jeff Wilson, a college professor turned entrepreneur who refers to himself as Professor Dumpster for the year he spent living in a metal trash container that he turned into a home, is trying to make this happen on a small scale. Mr. Wilsons nascent company, Kasita , wants to produce a line of one-bedroom homes. They would be identical in size and bought for a single price, and could be placed on city lots that traditional developers are unlikely to be interested in. Homes would be stacked together, creating de facto apartment buildings that could be built and unbuilt in a few weeks. Although that wouldnt do much to help a family of four, it might take some pressure off the housing market by directing younger people to studios instead of having them pile in together, freeing up some three-bedroom apartments for families. For now, Americans seem unlikely to embrace this vision on a large scale, and even if they did, it would take a long time to start seeing home prices drop or flatline. But mass-produced homes from the past  brick townhouses or bungalows that came from a Sears catalog  are now sought after, so this imaginary world neednt be uglier, though it very well may be.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   Also, even if homes were a lot cheaper, we would probably retain the societal benefits of homeownership: As Mr. Glaeser and Mr. Gyourkos data shows, housing is already relatively affordable in the vast majority of American cities. So there is little reason to believe that people would desert overpriced neighborhoods if they suddenly became cheaper. This does not mean that select places like New Yorks West Village or San Franciscos Mission District would suddenly be affordable  or that American cities would suddenly fill up with towering condominiums and blocks of identical rowhouses. Housing is a regional problem, spread across miles of cities and suburbs, so a lot of new development would probably occur in close-in suburbs where there is more land than people think. Take Boston. The median Boston suburb has a minimum lot size of one acre, and many suburbs have minimum lot sizes of one home per two or four acres. That is a huge drag on the regions overall housing supply, according to Mr. Glaeser. Yes, adding more homes, even medium-density ones, would annoy people looking for less crowded quarters. But the nation as a whole would probably be better off, both in jobs and in financial security. The money not spent on housing could flow to other, possibly more productive, investments  like stocks in new companies or bonds for infrastructure projects.   Of course, our view of homeownership is so entrenched in our economy, our political system and our tax code that it would be impossible to change in a short time, and probably even in a long time. But there could be political and societal benefits. What if local decisions that today are dictated by fears of declining property values could instead be made with an eye toward whats best for education or job growth? The point of this thought experiment isnt to embrace it full-on, but to open our eyes to the negatives of the national obsession of owning a home, expecting its value to rise, and using the levers of local government to keep neighborhoods as they are.

Credit Luke Sharrett/Bloomberg     SAN FRANCISCO  One of the oldest automakers in the United States is making a billion-dollar bet that one day, owning a car may not be a necessity of American life. Ford Motor announced on Friday its plans to invest $1 billion over the next five years in Argo AI, an artificial intelligence start-up formed in December that is focused on developing autonomous vehicle technology. The move is Fords biggest effort to move into self-driving car research. Argo AI will develop the technology exclusively for Ford at first, and then plans to license its technology to others. The investment is also a way for Ford, which is more than century old, to tap into Silicon Valley talent and make headway in a competitive space. Former Google and Uber self-driving technologists will lead the effort out of Pittsburgh, a hub for robotics and autonomous vehicle research, and satellite offices will be in place in the San Francisco Bay Area and southeastern Michigan.

But Argo AI will also use shares of its stock to lure robotics and engineering professionals from other companies, a challenge in a field where companies like General Motors, Chrysler, Uber and Google are all racing to bring autonomous vehicles to the mainstream.

The move comes as Ford positions itself as not just a manufacturer of cars, but as a provider of mobility services, enabling people to get around without owning cars. That is especially important as companies like Uber and Lyft, ride-hailing services popular in urban areas, have reduced the need for people to have their own vehicles. Ford sees mobility services as potentially more profitable than its traditional business of making and selling cars. Manufacturing vehicles requires billions of dollars in investments in plants and engineering  costs that are often difficult to recoup. Company executives have said mobility services could generate returns of around 20 percent, compared with the 8 percent it earns on making vehicles today.

There is not a strong enough pipeline of talent coming out of the universities today, Bryan Salesky, chief executive and co-founder of Argo AI, said on Friday. Mr. Salesky said Argo AI was looking to hire 200 employees across its three offices by the end of the year. In the last several months, Ford acquired Chariot, a start-up that ferries commuters around the San Francisco area, and invested in Civil Maps, which is developing 3-D mapping technology that can be used by self-driving cars. In August, Ford also acquired SAIPS, an Israeli company developing machine learning and computer-vision technology. A year ago, Ford opened a research center in Palo Alto, Calif., a move Mr. Fields acknowledged was aimed at making Ford part of the ecosystem of Silicon Valley. Ford is also remaking its headquarters and main development center in Dearborn, Mich., just outside Detroit, into two sprawling, high-tech campuses of energy-efficient buildings  similar to those that dot Silicon Valley. The automaker envisions the new campuses, which will take 10 years to complete, as places that will showcase autonomous shuttles as well as electric bikes and other green modes of transportation. Other automakers are moving in the same direction. General Motors has invested $500 million in Lyft, a ride-hailing service and main rival of Uber. G.M. also acquired Cruise Automation, a maker of sensors and other gear that can enable conventional automobiles to drive themselves on highways.

FEB. 14, 2017  Roads and Transport Authority of Dubai       Like a scene from  The Jetsons,  commuters in Dubai , in the United Arab Emirates, may soon climb aboard automated flying taxis, soaring over busy streets and past the desert citys gleaming skyscrapers, all  quite literally  at the push of a button. Passenger drones, capable of carrying a single rider and a small suitcase, will begin buzzing above the emirate as early as July, according to the director of the citys transportation authority, part of an ambitious plan to increase driverless technology. Already, the eight-rotor drone, made by the Chinese firm Ehang , has flown test runs past the Burj Al Arab, Dubais iconic, sail-shaped skyscraper. The drone is not just a model but it has really flown in Dubai skies, Mattar Al Tayer , the director general of Dubais Roads and Transport Authority, said on Monday, adding that the emirate would spare no effort to launch autonomous aerial vehicles by July.

The drone is the latest in a series of measures to impose cutting-edge technology to help with the citys congested roadways. The ruler of Dubai, Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, announced last year that 25 percent of all journeys in the city would be conducted by driverless vehicles by 2030. The city operates the worlds longest driverless subway system and began a trial program last year using automated cars produced by Frances Easymile. In October, the city signed a deal with the Los Angeles-based Hyperloop One to study the potential for a hyperloop  a vacuum-like tube through which vehicle pods hurtle at speeds faster than airliners  between Dubai and Abu Dhabi, the United Arab Emirates capital.

BOUDETTE FEB. 15, 2017     Continue reading the main story  Share This Page   Continue reading the main story            Photo        Last year, traffic deaths increased 6 percent, to 40,200, according to estimates released on Wednesday by the National Safety Council. The two-year increase  14 percent  is the largest in more than a half a century.   Credit Getty Images     Over the last decade, new cars have gotten electronic stability control systems to prevent skids, rearview cameras to prevent fender benders and more airbags to protect occupants in collisions. Hundreds of millions of dollars have been spent on campaigns to remind the public of the dangers of drunken driving, failing to buckle up and texting while on the go. Despite all that, more Americans are dying on roads and highways than in years, and the sudden and sharp increase has alarmed safety advocates. The latest batch of bad news arrived Wednesday in traffic fatality estimates released by the National Safety Council, a nonprofit organization that works closely with federal auto-safety regulators. According to its estimates , 40,200 people died in accidents involving motor vehicles in 2016, a 6 percent rise from the year before. If the estimates are confirmed, it will be the first time since 2007 that more than 40,000 people have died in motor vehicle accidents in a single year. The 2016 total comes after a 7 percent rise in 2015 and means the two-year increase  14 percent  is the largest in more than a half a century.

Complacency is killing us.  Continue reading the main story         Advertisement   Continue reading the main story       Part of the increase is believed to stem from the improving economy, which has led Americans to drive more miles for both work and pleasure. But safety advocates say that explains only part of the trend because the number of deaths as a percentage of miles driven is also increasing. They also point to data suggesting an increase in distracted driving. While cars and phones now offer advanced voice controls and other features intended to keep drivers eyes on the road, apps like Facebook, Google Maps, Snapchat and others have created new temptations that drivers and passengers find hard to resist. Its not just talking on the phone thats a problem today, said Jonathan Adkins, executive director of the Governors Highway Safety Association. You now have all these other apps that people can use on their phones. Government officials and safety advocates contend, however, that more than anything else, the increase in deaths has been caused by more lenient enforcement of seatbelt, drunken driving and speeding regulations by authorities and a reluctance by lawmakers to pass more restrictive measures. A patchwork of state laws leaves many areas where drivers can choose not to buckle up, with little likelihood of being stopped. Only 18 states have laws requiring seatbelts for both front and rear occupants and categorize not wearing them as a primary offense  meaning drivers can be pulled over for that alone. In 15 states, failure to wear a seatbelt in front seats is only a secondary offense  drivers cannot be given tickets unless they are pulled over for other violations. Its still the same things that are killing drivers  belts, booze and speed, Mr. Adkins said.

In Alabama, steady budget cuts have resulted in a decline in the number of troopers patrolling the states 103,000 miles of highways. David Brown, a research associate at the University of Alabamas Center for Advanced Public Safety, studied the states 2016 traffic fatality reports and found an increase in fatalities involving high-speed crashes.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   Total crashes were up less than 5 percent, but fatalities were up 25 percent, he said in an interview. I think speeding is the No. 1 problem. There are times of the day when we only have one or two troopers on duty in a county, so you can speed, and theres no one there to deter it. In some states, highway speed limits are rising. In recent years, Texas has increased speed limits to 85 miles per hour in some rural areas. About 1,500 miles of roads have a limit of 75 miles per hour or higher. In the fall, the N.H.T.S.A., the National Transportation Safety Board and several nongovernmental organizations, including the National Safety Council, began the Road to Zero initiative to eliminate traffic fatalities within 30 years. The effort places heavy emphasis on the promise of autonomous vehicles. But others say that more needs to be done now on basic road safety issues. The way to bring down the rise in deaths is with a wide range of the nuts-and-bolts measures, not self-driving cars, the consumer advocate Ralph Nader said in an interview in October. Mr. Nader said states could reduce traffic deaths simply by requiring rear-seat occupants to wear seatbelts, installing more cameras to catch speeding drivers without a police presence and tightening regulations on heavy trucking. In presenting its 2016 fatality estimates, the National Safety Council endorsed those ideas and also called for bans on all use of smartphones by drivers, even if they use hands-free calling or messaging. The council is also advocating mandatory motorcycle helmet laws and ignition locks that prevent repeat drunken drivers from operating their vehicles while impaired. The safety councils figures typically correspond closely to the fatality totals that the N.H.T.S.A. compiles, but they include accidents off public roads and deaths occurring over a longer period after a crash.

Credit Preston Gannaway for The New York Times     Good morning. (Want to get California Today by email? Heres the sign-up .) Lets turn it over to Conor Dougherty , a reporter based in the Bay Area , for todays introduction . California is crazy expensive. But should it be? The Upshot recently took a look at how much housing costs in various cities in the United States in relation to how much economists think it should cost. Not surprisingly, coastal California tops the list of the countrys most overpriced places. As the chart shows, the worst discrepancy is the San Francisco metropolitan area, where a standard house should cost about $300,000  but in reality is more like $800,000 (based on 2013 figures). Next comes cities and counties in coastal Southern California  basically a band of overpriced housing that stretches downward from Ventura to the San Diego border.  Photo        Inland cities like Sacramento, Fresno and Riverside are all much cheaper, which is why many Californians have moved eastward.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   The research behind the story comes from a pair of economists who tried to figure out how much of a homes cost comes from land-use regulation. The paper argues that most of the difference is caused by regulatory hurdles like design and environmental reviews that can add years to a projects timeline and suppress the overall housing supply. The result is overpayment on a grand scale for the few homes that do get built. Their figures are theoretical, and people are sure to disagree with them.  Continue reading the main story         Advertisement   Continue reading the main story       The broader point  which isnt remotely controversial  is that California cities have some of the most restrictive building laws in the nation, and this is a big reason why the states per capita home supply is 49th out of 50 states, and why it costs so much to live here .

So even if San Francisco, Los Angeles and their surrounding cities started a surge in building, that doesnt mean that homes in the most sought-after places like the Mission District or Santa Monica will ever be close to affordable. The research suggests the bigger problem with coastal California isnt that not enough people can afford to live exactly where they want  its that not enough people can afford to live there at all.

An acquisition of the Opel and Vauxhall brands could bolster the fortunes of PSA Group in Europe. Credit Ronald Wittek/European Pressphoto Agency By  Jack Ewing , Chad Bray and Bill Vlasic Feb. 14, 2017 FRANKFURT  General Motors floated the possibility on Tuesday that it could exit the large but troubled European market by selling its chronically unprofitable Opel unit to the French maker of Peugeot and Citroen cars. The potential deal would create Europes second-largest carmaker, challenging the market leader Volkswagen, which is vulnerable because of an emissions scandal. For General Motors, a sale would free it from persistent losses in Europe and help fulfill pledges by its chief executive to improve overall profit margins and increase returns to shareholders. At the same time that the company has been struggling in the European market, it has been become increasingly reliant on China and its core North American market. More losses in Europe could undercut its ability to invest in those more lucrative regions, as well as fund new ventures into autonomous vehicles and mobility services. While G.M. has ambitious long-term plans for Europe, we currently see the business as mediocre at best, Brian Johnson, an analyst with Barclays, wrote on Tuesday. Why not sell now, when Europe is steadier, versus trying to sell at a time when the market is in a downturn. Still, an agreement, between G.M. and PSA Group in France, would also link two of Europes weakest carmakers, which have more production capacity than they need and few products able to compete in the lucrative luxury market. PSA is the European Unions third-biggest automaker, with 9.9 percent of the market in 2016, according to the European Automobile Manufacturers Association. The purchase of Opel, which holds 6.7 percent of the market, would help the company vault past Renault into second place. G.M. and PSA confirmed the talks, but they cautioned that there can be no assurance that an agreement will be reached. Indeed, a previous deal to sell Opel to a group including a Russian bank fell apart in 2009. The latest potential deal will most likely face its own challenges. Opels powerful labor representatives signaled that they would oppose a merger of the carmakers, which have little prospect of being competitive in the crowded European market unless they cut their work forces. Opel has been a problem for G.M. for decades. Once a serious rival to Volkswagen, it began losing market share in the 1990s, which was also the last time it made a profit. While the Volkswagen Group has become the worlds biggest carmaker, Opel slipped to Europes margins. Opel has been hemorrhaging money for the last 16 years, so hard decisions are on the table in Mary Barras version of a profitable G.M., said Rebecca Lindland, an analyst with the auto-research firm Kelley Blue Book. The G.M. unit suffered from frequent turnover in top management, friction with labor representatives and products that buyers perceived as dull or inferior. Among other things, Volkswagen was faster to offer cars with diesel motors, which are popular in Europe because of their superior fuel economy compared with gasoline vehicles. Shares of G.M. closed up 4.8. percent on Tuesday. In 2009, the company was on the verge of selling Opel to a consortium made of Magna, an auto parts supplier based in Canada, and the Russian lender Sberbank. But the American carmaker pulled out of the deal at the last minute, reportedly because of fear that the takeover would give the Russians access to its patents and technology. Since then, Opels financial situation has improved under the leadership of Karl-Thomas Neumann, a former Volkswagen executive. News of the merger talks came as G.M. reported that its European division had posted a loss of $257 million in 2016, an improvement from a loss of $813 million the year before. Volkswagens emissions scandal also presents a chance for competitors to challenge the German carmakers dominance. Volkswagens market share, including other company brands like Audi and Porsche, slipped in 2016 to 23.9 percent from 24.6 percent the year before. But even combined, PSA and Opel would have a lot of catching up to do. Both lost market share in Europe last year to Renault and Fiat Chrysler. And all of the mid-price brands have lost buyers to BMW and Daimler, which makes Mercedes vehicles. Those two companies have increasingly offered products priced within reach of middle-class customers. For PSA, one advantage of a deal with Opel would be the potential to draw on German engineering expertise coveted by many buyers. A design center at Opel headquarters in Russelsheim, Germany, provides G.M. with expertise in smaller cars. But Opel and PSA, based in Paris, suffer from a surplus of production capacity and are in countries where it is extremely difficult to close factories or lay off workers. Opels future is further clouded by Britains decision to leave the European Union. The country, where Opel vehicles are sold under the Vauxhall brand, is the units strongest market, accounting for almost a third of sales. The company also has factories in the British cities of Ellesmere Port and Luton, and its ability to move vehicles, components and people in and out of Britain will become more complicated after the country exits the European Union. Opels labor representatives signaled skepticism about the deal. In a statement on Tuesday, the IG Metall union and the Opel workers council said they were surprised to learn of the talks. They said the talks represented an unprecedented violation of workers legal rights in Europe to be consulted about major decisions. The labor representatives also said the deal bore scrutiny because of the past record of cooperation between PSA and G.M. PSA and G.M. announced an alliance in 2012 to save costs by buying components jointly and building some vehicles together. G.M. took a 7 percent stake in PSA at the time, but sold it the next year as PSAs finances worsened. The French government owns about 14 percent of PSA after providing the automaker with badly needed cash in 2014. The French company and G.M. continue to jointly produce some vehicles. Opel, which employs about 35,000 worldwide, sold 1.2 million vehicles last year. PSA, with about 180,000 workers, sold 3.1 million vehicles last year. Both companies depend heavily on sales in Europe, which has been suffering from slow economic growth for a decade. If the deal goes through, G.M. would be without a major presence in Europe for the first time in nearly 90 years. Adam Opel founded Opel in Russelsheim in 1862. It originally produced sewing machines, later switching to bicycles and then automobiles. General Motors acquired an 80 percent stake in the company in 1929.

Credit Randy Pench/The Sacramento Bee, via Associated Press     Good morning. (Want to get California Today by email? Heres the sign-up .) Thousands of people fled areas downriver from Lake Oroville on Sunday after a secondary spillway at the swollen reservoir was compromised , raising fears of a collapse that might unleash disastrous flooding. By late Sunday, after whole towns had emptied out , officials said the immediate danger appeared to have passed. Evacuation orders, however, remained in place until they could be sure. There are still a lot of unknowns, Sheriff Kory L. Honea of Butte County said at a news conference. State officials had been fixated on the troubles at Lake Oroville, about 70 miles north of Sacramento, since last Tuesday, when part of its main spillway caved in during water releases into the Feather River below.

But intense rain-fed runoff pushing the reservoir toward its brim made that impossible.  Continue reading the main story         Advertisement   Continue reading the main story       Then, early Saturday, as the water continued to rise, the emergency spillway came into play. Unlike the main concrete-lined spillway, the emergency spillway is essentially a hillside. No lever is required  water cascades over the embankment the way it would over a sinks edge when the lake rises high enough.

Evacuation orders then went out for nearly 190,000 residents of the valley floor, including the towns of Oroville, Marysville and Yuba City. Heres what else we know:  By Sunday night, water was no longer flowing over the emergency spillway. Officials said crews would work to plug the crevice in the spillway with rocks.  More rain is expected later this week. In preparation, officials said they would continue to send water down the main spillway in hopes of dropping the lakes level by 50 feet.  Oroville Dam itself remained sound, officials said. At 770 feet, the nations tallest dam is structurally separate from the reservoirs spillways. What we dont know:  When evacuees, many sheltering in Chico , would be allowed to return home. Officials said they hoped to have a better idea on Monday.  The extent of damage to the emergency spillway. Engineers planned to inspect the damage at first light on Monday.

By MICHAEL KIMMELMAN,  Photographs by JOSH HANER   FEB. 17, 2017      MEXICO CITY  On bad days, you can smell the stench from a mile away, drifting over a nowhere sprawl of highways and office parks.  When the Grand Canal was completed, at the end of the 1800s, it was Mexico Citys Brooklyn Bridge, a major feat of engineering and a symbol of civic pride: 29 miles long, with the ability to move tens of thousands of gallons of wastewater per second. It promised to solve the flooding and sewage problems that had plagued the city for centuries.  Only it didnt, pretty much from the start. The canal was based on gravity. And Mexico City, a mile and a half above sea level, was sinking, collapsing in on itself.    It still is, faster and faster, and the canal is just one victim of what has become a vicious cycle. Always short of water, Mexico City keeps drilling deeper for more, weakening the ancient clay lake beds on which the Aztecs first built much of the city, causing it to crumble even further.

In the immense neighborhood of Iztapalapa  where nearly two million people live, many of them unable to count on water from their taps  a teenager was swallowed up where a crack in the brittle ground split open a street. Sidewalks resemble broken china, and 15 elementary schools have crumbled or caved in.  Much is being written about climate change and the impact of rising seas on waterfront populations. But coasts are not the only places affected. Mexico City  high in the mountains, in the center of the country  is a glaring example. The world has a lot invested in crowded capitals like this one, with vast numbers of people, huge economies and the stability of a hemisphere at risk.      Changing Climate, Changing Cities  How climate change is challenging the worlds urban centers.       Mexico City  Part 1       China  Part 2       Rotterdam  Part 3       Houston  Part 4         Graphics by Derek Watkins and Jeremy White. Design by Matt Ruby and Rumsey Taylor.   One study predicts that 10 percent of Mexicans ages 15 to 65 could eventually try to emigrate north as a result of rising temperatures, drought and floods, potentially scattering millions of people and heightening already extreme political tensions over immigration.  The effects of climate change are varied and opportunistic, but one thing is consistent: They are like sparks in the tinder. They expose cities biggest vulnerabilities, inflaming troubles that politicians and city planners often ignore or try to paper over. And they spread outward, defying borders.  Thats what this series is about  how global cities tackle climate threats, or fail to. Around the world, extreme weather and water scarcity are accelerating repression, regional conflicts and violence. A Columbia University report found that where rainfall declines, the risk of a low-level conflict escalating to a full-scale civil war approximately doubles the following year. The Pentagons term for climate change is threat multiplier.  And nowhere does this apply more obviously than in cities. This is the first urban century in human history, the first time more people live in cities than dont, with predictions that three-quarters of the global population will be urban by 2050. By that time, according to another study, there may be more than 700 million climate refugees on the move.  For many cities around the world, adapting to climate change is a route to long-term prosperity. Thats the good news, where societies are willing to listen. But adaptation can also be costly and slow. It can run counter to the rhythms of political campaigns and headlong into powerful, entrenched interests, confounding business as usual. This is, in effect, what happened in New Orleans, which ignored countless warning signs, destroyed natural protections, gave developers a free pass and failed to reinforce levees before Hurricane Katrina left much of the city in ruins.  Unlike traffic jams or crime, climate change isnt something most people easily feel or see. It is certainly not what residents in Mexico City talk about every day. But it is like an approaching storm, straining an already precarious social fabric and threatening to push a great city toward a breaking point.  As Arnoldo Kramer, Mexico Citys chief resilience officer, put it: Climate change has become the biggest long-term threat to this citys future. And thats because it is linked to water, health, air pollution, traffic disruption from floods, housing vulnerability to landslides  which means we cant begin to address any of the citys real problems without facing the climate issue.  Theres much more at stake than this citys well being. At the extreme, if climate change wreaks havoc on the social and economic fabric of global linchpins like Mexico City, warns the writer Christian Parenti, no amount of walls, guns, barbed wire, armed aerial drones or permanently deployed mercenaries will be able to save one half of the planet from the other.          Buildings now undulate where once the area was flat.  Josh Haner/The New York Times      Sprawl and Subsidence  An element of magical realism plays into Mexico Citys sinking. At a roundabout along the Paseo de la Reforma, the citys wide downtown boulevard, the gilded Angel of Independence, a symbol of Mexican pride, looks over a sea of traffic from the top of a tall Corinthian column.

Tourists snap pictures without realizing that when Mexicos president cut the ribbon for the column in 1910, the monument sat on a sculptured base reached by climbing nine shallow steps. But over the decades, the whole neighborhood around the monument sank, like a receding ocean at low tide, gradually marooning the Angel. Fourteen large steps eventually had to be added to the base so that the monument still connected to the street.  Deeper in the citys historic center, the rear of the National Palace now tilts over the sidewalk like a sea captain leaning into a strong headwind. Buildings here can resemble Cubist drawings, with slanting windows, wavy cornices and doors that no longer align with their frames. Pedestrians trudge up hills where the once flat lake bed has given way. The cathedral in the citys central square, known as the Zocalo, famously sunken in spots during the last century, is a kind of fun house, with a leaning chapel and a bell tower into which stone wedges were inserted during construction to act more or less like matchbooks under the leg of a wobbly cafe table.         Volcanic soil safeguarded the water supply for centuries.  Josh Haner/The New York Times      Loreta Castro Reguera is a young, Harvard-trained architect who has made a specialty of the sinking ground in Mexico City, a phenomenon known as subsidence. She pointed down a main street that stretches from the Zocalo and divides east from west, following the route of an ancient Aztec dike.  The whole city occupies what was once a network of lakes. In 1325, the Aztecs established their capital, Tenochtitlan, on an island. Over time, they expanded the city with landfill and planted crops on floating gardens called chinampas, plots of arable soil created from wattle and sediment. The lakes provided the Aztecs with a line of defense, the chinampas with sustenance. The idea: Live with nature.  Then the conquering Spaniards waged war against water, determined to subdue it. The Aztec system was foreign to them. They replaced the dikes and canals with streets and squares. They drained the lakes and cleared forestland, suffering flood after flood, including one that drowned the city for five straight years.  The Aztecs managed, Ms. Castro said. But they had 300,000 people. We now have 21 million.         An 18th-century engraving.  Historical Picture Archive/Corbis, via Getty Images      Mexico City today is an agglomeration of neighborhoods that are really many big cities cheek by jowl. During the last century, millions of migrants poured in from the countryside to find jobs. The citys growth, from 30 square miles in 1950 to a metropolitan area of about 3,000 square miles 60 years later, has produced a vibrant but chaotic megalopolis of largely unplanned and sprawling development. Highways and cars choke the atmosphere with heat-inducing carbon dioxide  and development has wiped out nearly every remaining trace of the original lakes, taxing the underground aquifers and forcing what was once a water-rich valley to import billions of gallons from far away.  The system of getting the water from there to here is a miracle of modern hydroengineering. But it is also a crazy feat, in part a consequence of the fact that the city, with a legacy of struggling government, has no large-scale operation for recycling wastewater or collecting rainwater, forcing it to expel a staggering 200 billion gallons of both via crippled sewers like the Grand Canal. Mexico City now imports as much as 40 percent of its water from remote sources  then squanders more than 40 percent of what runs through its 8,000 miles of pipes because of leaks and pilfering. This is not to mention that pumping all this water more than a mile up into the mountains consumes roughly as much energy as does the entire metropolis of Puebla, a Mexican state capital with a population akin to Philadelphias.  Even with this mind-boggling undertaking, the government acknowledges that nearly 20 percent of Mexico City residents  critics put the number even higher  still cant count on getting water from their taps each day. For some residents, water comes only once a week, or once every several weeks, and that may mean just an hour of yellow muck dripping from the faucet. Those people have to hire trucks to deliver drinking water, at costs sometimes exponentially higher than wealthy residents pay in better-served neighborhoods.          Some residents rely on pipas, large trucks with hoses that deliver water from aquifers.  Josh Haner/The New York Times             A pipa in the San Andres Totoltepec neighborhood.  Josh Haner/The New York Times       Overseeing the citys water supply is a thin, patient man with the war-weary air of an old general: Ramon Aguirre Diaz, director of the Water System of Mexico City, is unusually frank about the perils ahead.  Climate change is expected to have two effects, he told me. We expect heavier, more intense rains, which means more floods, but also more and longer droughts.  If it stops raining in the reservoirs where the city gets its water, were facing a potential disaster, he said. There is no way we can provide enough trucks of water to deal with that scenario.  If we have the problems that California and Sao Paulo have had, he added, there is the serious possibility of unrest.  The problem is not simply that the aquifers are being depleted. Mexico City rests on a mix of clay lake beds and volcanic soil. Areas like downtown sit on clay. Other districts were built on volcanic fields.  Volcanic soil absorbs water and delivers it to the aquifers. Its stable and porous. Picture a bucket filled with marbles. You can pour water into the bucket, and the marbles will hardly move. Stick a straw into the bucket to extract the water, and the marbles still wont move. For centuries, before the population exploded, volcanic soil guaranteed that the city had water underground.  Mexico Citys water crisis today comes partly from the fact that so much of this porous land  including large stretches of what Mexico City has supposedly set aside for agriculture and preservation, called conservation land  has been developed. So it is buried beneath concrete and asphalt, stopping rain from filtering down to the aquifers, causing floods and creating heat islands that raise temperatures further and only increase the demand for water. This is part of the sprawl problem.  Now, picture layered sheets of plastic. On a molecular level, clay acts sort of like that. It doesnt really absorb water. Instead, water settles between the sheets. When the water is drained, the sheets can collapse and crack. If all of Mexico City were built on clay, it would at least sink at the same rate and subsidence would be an anecdote, Mr. Aguirre said.       But because the city is built on a mix of clay and volcanic soil, it sinks unevenly, causing dramatic and deadly fissures. In Iztapalapa, Pedro Moctezuma Barragan, director of ecological studies at the Metropolitan Autonomous University, climbed down into what felt like a ravine where a street had given way. Hes been tracking the problem for years. Fifteen thousand houses in the area, he said, had been damaged by sinking ground.          The Grand Canal was meant to solve flooding and sewage problems that had plagued the city for centuries.  Josh Haner/The New York Times      The Center of Womens Lives  Deep below the historic center, water extracted from aquifers now can end up just beyond the city limits, in Ecatepec, at one of the largest pumping stations along the Grand Canal. The pump, completed in 2007, was built to move 11,000 gallons per second  essentially water that now needs to be lifted up from where the canal has collapsed, just so that it can continue on its way.  The man in charge of this herculean undertaking is Carlos Salgado Teran, chief of the department of drainage for Zone A in Mexico City, a trim, no-funny-business official in a starched bright green shirt. According to Mr. Salgado, the Grand Canal today is working at only 30 percent of capacity because of subsidence. He admitted that it was a Sisyphean struggle to keep up with the citys decline. Parts of the canal around Ecatepec have sunk an additional six feet just since the plant was built, he said.  He showed me around one morning. The canal is wide open, a stinking river of sewage belching methane and sulfuric acid. Apartment blocks, incongruously painted cheerful Crayola colors, hug the bank. A lonely tricycle sat in a parking lot near where the stations giant, noisy engines churn out greasy white foam that coats the black water.          Today, the canal operates at only 30 percent of capacity.  Josh Haner/The New York Times             A stretch of canal that runs under a road.  Josh Haner/The New York Times       Mr. Salgado asked if I wanted a tour of the filters. The smell can be unbearable, and its very unhealthy, he cautioned.  The district of Tlalpan is on the opposite side of Mexico City. There, Claudia Sheinbaum, a former environment minister who developed the citys first climate change program, is now a local district president. She has the slightly impatient, defensive mien of someone wrestling with an impossible mission.  With climate change, the situation will only get much worse, she said. A warming climate will only increase the citys problems with pollution, specifically ozone. Heat waves mean health crises and rising costs for health care in a city where air-conditioning is not commonplace in poor neighborhoods. She seconded what Mr. Aguirre had said about the threat of drought. Yes, she said, if there is drought we are not prepared.  For the time being, Well 30 helps supply Tlalpan with drinking water. One recent morning, large trucks, called pipas, some with neat lettering that promised agua potable, crowded a muddy turnoff beside the highway. From a low cinder-block building, painted red, scrawled with graffiti and crowned in barbed wire, sprouted two long, angled pipes connected to dangling hoses. The arrangement of the pipes and hoses looked something like the gallows in a game of hangman.  These pipes plunge 1,000 feet down to reach an aquifer. Trucks, endlessly, one after another, wait their turn to fill up, positioning themselves beneath the hoses.  This is where residents of Tlalpan get water when they cant get it from their faucets. It takes more than 500 trips a day to satisfy the parched citizens of the district. Juan Jose Lopez, the district representative at the well, distributes assignments from a desk in the red building piled with stacks of orders that residents file. Drivers wait at his window, as at a fast-food drive-through, to pick up their assignments.  The pump is always working, Mr. Lopez said. At least it is still good water.  To the east, in Iztapalapa, some wells tap into a noxious stew contaminated by minerals and chemicals. Angry residents wait in lines overnight to plead with pipa drivers, who sometimes pit desperate families against one another, seeing who pays the bigger bribe.  Fernando Gonzalez, who helped manage the water supply for Iztapalapa for 32 years, said the health effects of contaminated water were clear to residents whose infants regularly broke out in rashes and whose grandparents suffered colitis.  In some cases, the wait for water trucks can make the cable guy look punctual: Deliveries may be promised in three to 30 days, forcing residents to stay home the whole time, because orders are canceled if theres no one in the house when the trucks arrive.  Water becomes the center of womens lives in places where there is a serious problem, points out Mireya Imaz, a program director at the National Autonomous University of Mexico. Women in Iztapalapa can spend all night waiting for the pipas, then they have to be home for the trucks, and sometimes they will ride with the drivers to make sure the drivers deliver the water, which is not always a safe thing to do.  It becomes impossible for many poor women to work outside the home, she said. The whole system is made worse by corruption.  Thats pretty much what I heard talking to women in Iztapalapa. Virginia Josefina Ramirez Granillo was standing in the courtyard of a community center in San Miguel Teotongo, a hilly neighborhood on the edge of the district, next to a wishful mural showing a woman washing clothes in her sink with a running faucet.  We line up at 3 in the morning for the pipa, Ms. Ramirez said, pointing toward a distant spot where the trucks arrive. We wait for hours to get water that doesnt last a week, and usually there arent enough pipas. Sometimes there is violence. Women sell their spaces in the line. If youre from the wrong political party, you dont get water. You have to show your party affiliation, your voting ID.  People in rich neighborhoods on the other side of town, they dont have to think about water, she added. But for us it is something we think about all day, every day.          A boy in Xochimilco washes a machete in pipa water.  Josh Haner/The New York Times      One Pipa, Two Donkeys  Finally, there are places in Mexico City that even pipas cant reach, where the precariousness of the entire water system, and by extension the whole city, is epitomized in a few scruffy acres.  Diana Contreras Guzman lives in the highlands of the district of Xochimilco, where the roads rise almost vertically and dirt byways lead to shanties made of corrugated tin, cinder block and cardboard. A young single mother, she lives with nine relatives in a one-room shack. Ms. Guzmans father and three brothers are janitors. Her sister works in an office. To reach a bus to get to work, more than a mile down the hill, they set out at 4:30 a.m., leaving Ms. Guzman, most days, to care for four small children  and to deal with water.  Once a week, a pipa delivers water farther up the hill, where the road is paved. When that happens, Ms. Guzman, a small, thin woman, spends two hours climbing up the hill and back down again, seven times in all, lugging 90 pounds of water on each return trip. Sometimes Josue and Valentina, two of the children, try to help, dragging half-gallon bottles. Ms. Guzman cant leave the house for long, she said, in case someone steals water from her cistern.         Diana Contreras Guzman and her family spend over 10 percent of their income on water.  Josh Haner/The New York Times      For 100 gallons from the pipa, she pays 25 cents. But this doesnt begin to supply her family with enough water. So every day she also pays Angel, a neighbor in his 70s who owns a pair of donkeys named Reindeer and Rabbit. The donkeys trudge plastic containers of water, four at a time, from a well down the hill.  Ms. Guzmans family earns $600 a month. They ultimately have to spend more than 10 percent of that income on water  enough to yield about 10 gallons per person per day.  The average resident in a wealthy Mexico City neighborhood to the west, nearer the reservoirs, consumes 100 gallons per day, experts note. The wealthy resident pays one-tenth what Ms. Guzman does.         Donkeys deliver water in some areas not served by pipas.  Josh Haner/The New York Times      Is there any clearer indication that everything about water in this city comes down to inequity? said David Vargas, whose company, Isla Urbana, produces a low-cost rainwater-harvesting system.  I put this question to Tanya Muller Garcia, the citys secretary for the environment. Were constantly breaking records for the warmest months, she said, handing over a report on Mexico Citys sustainability plans. There are predictions that by 2080 the citys average temperature will have risen several degrees and that annual rainfall will have decreased 20 percent.  Ms. Muller was defensive about the citys inability to supply every resident with clean water, insisting that the numbers of those unserved were exaggerated. She listed progressive new programs intended to combat pollution, preserve green spaces and reduce the demand for cars by improving mass transit. This city is full of brilliant people with good ideas, including a plan to create a water fund into which corporations drawing heavily on the water supply would pay  to help improve services in less advantaged areas. Another plan envisions a public park that would double as a rainwater collection basin. And theres a long-term agenda to turn the airport into a green, mixed-use district.  Meanwhile, the Mexican federal government envisions constructing a giant new airport on a dry lake bed, exactly the worst place to build. It recently cut to zero federal money budgeted for fixing the citys pipes, Metro and other critical infrastructure. Partly this is just politics. The mayor of Mexico City has talked about running for president. The current administration doesnt want to do him any favors. At the same time, the federal government has its own agenda, promoting highways, cars and sprawl.  The disconnect between local and federal officials is not unique to Mexico. Often big cities find themselves undermined by state and federal politicians catering to a different electorate, as if in the end the consequences wont be ruinous for everyone.  There has to be a consensus  of scientists, politicians, engineers and society  when it comes to pollution, water, climate, Ms. Sheinbaum, the former environment minister, stressed. We have the resources, but lack the political will.  It turns out Ms. Sheinbaum herself lives in a house that can count on water from the tap only twice a month.  So she, too, orders pipas to come to fill her cistern.         A warming climate will accelerate the effects of pollution.
