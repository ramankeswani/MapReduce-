The search for Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 has helped create maps revealing the ocean floors topographical complexity.   Credit Kim Picard and Jonah Sullivan     On March 8, 2014, Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 vanished with 239 passengers and crew aboard as it crossed the Indian Ocean, triggering a large-scale search for its remains that lasted nearly three years . As a byproduct of the tragedy, scientists have gained access to more than 100,000 square miles of seafloor mapped at a level of detail that provides a rare look at the oceans geological processes. Its an incredible trove of data, said Millard F. Coffin , a marine geophysicist from the Institute for Marine and Antarctic Studies at the University of Tasmania in Australia. Ive been working in this part of the Indian Ocean for 30-plus years and over many voyages in the eastern Indian Ocean Ive never seen this level of resolution. Dr. Coffin worked with a group of about 10 scientists from Geoscience Australia , the national geosciences agency in Australia, to analyze data from the search. They were given access to high-resolution sonar information collected on ships, and data obtained by remotely operated vehicles and autonomous underwater drones. The information was provided by the Australian Transport Safety Bureau , which led the search. When we look at these data, were constantly keeping in mind that we wouldnt have this data if it werent for a terrible tragedy, Dr. Coffin said. He and his colleagues published a summary of their findings on Wednesday in the journal EOS .  Photo        A 3-D model of the Broken Ridge along the Diamantina Escarpment.   Credit Geoscience Australia    Previous satellite data provided scientists with information about the Indian Ocean at a resolution of about five square kilometers, or about two square miles. With the instruments from the search ships, they have collected information at a resolution of meters, and in some locations they have used remote operating vehicles and underwater autonomous vehicles to gain detail on the scale of centimeters.

The Flight 370 search also provided information about tectonic and volcanic activity, Dr. Coffin said.  Continue reading the main story         Advertisement   Continue reading the main story       The team plans to release more detailed looks into its findings later in the year, and the full data set from the search will be made available in the middle of the year. Walter H.F. Smith, a geophysicist with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, said the hunt for the lost jetliner highlighted how little we know about the oceans. In a paper that was also published Wednesday in the journal EOS , he and his colleagues explained how common unmapped areas of ocean are.     Graphic  How Missing Jets Debris Could Have Floated to Reunion  This animation shows where floating debris from Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 could have drifted if experts are correct about where the plane went down.         OPEN Graphic      There are all kinds of things you cant do if you dont know the shape of the ocean bottom, or dont know it properly, Dr. Smith said. The consequences of not knowing, he said, can hinder how experts predict tsunamis, understand ocean currents, make climate forecasts, study marine life and search for missing planes. Previous studies have suggested that only 8 percent of the worlds oceans have been mapped, meaning that a ship measured an areas depth and recorded it in a scientific database. Before Flight 370s disappearance, only 5 percent of the southeast Indian Ocean had been mapped, Dr. Smith said. To figure out how often people fly over unmapped parts of the worlds oceans, Dr. Smith and his colleagues compared data on mapped and unmapped segments of the worlds ocean segments with a database of commercial airline routes . They found that about 60 percent of all commercial flights that cross over the ocean travel over waters with unmeasured depths. The longest contiguous route over unmapped ocean was from Kennedy International Airport in New York to Chongqing Jiangbei International Airport in China, a journey over more than 1,200 nautical miles of unmapped ocean. I wanted people to realize that its not just Malaysia Airlines straying into the southeast Indian Ocean where it shouldnt have been, he said. Even when your aircraft is exactly where its supposed to be, it might be over unknown ocean.   Like the Science Times page on Facebook. | Sign up for the Science Times newsletter.

Credit Emily Berl for The New York Times        Laura Dern has been acting since she was a tween girl, and, at 50, she is as in demand as ever. This year she has a remarkably full slate, including roles as a high-powered working mother in Big Little Lies (currently airing on HBO) and as Woody Harrelsons ex-wife in the film Wilson (to hit theaters on March 24). Later this year, she will appear in the David Lynch reboot of Twin Peaks (out in May) and in  Star Wars: Episode VIII  The Last Jedi (planned for December). When she is not onscreen, Ms. Dern is often shuttling her two children around town. Find out the skin care and makeup favorites that keep her feeling pulled together through it all. Skin Care I have a few beloved staples. Ive been going to the Face Place for facials for many years, so at home Ill wash and sometimes moisturize with their products. Recently Ive also discovered Kate Somerville DermalQuench spray. Its oxygen you spray on your face, and it hydrates. I take it on planes. Im not as diligent as I should be about sunscreen, but if Im really going to be in the sun, I use an SPF by Dermalogica . My body lotion is Eminence . They use a lot of bamboo or coconut oil derivatives. The one thing that is with me at all times, in my purse, in the car, is my La Mer lip balm . I love it so much that when my 11-year-old daughter was figuring out what to give me for Christmas, she ended up getting it for my stocking. At night, I might use this really beautiful camellia oil by Julie Hewett , the makeup artist. Or Ill use i S Clinica l  they have a lot of cool oils and serums that Im just learning about. Makeup Being an actress my whole life, it feels so good to have a clean face when Im off, so Im not a big makeup wearer. The two things I always put on are my La Mer lip balm and the LOreal mascara Ive been using forever  the Voluminous one in waterproof black. If I need something more, I use La Prairie cream blush . Its super-natural and also looks great on film when you want to look like you dont have any makeup on but you need some color.   Slide Show       Slide Show | 6 Photos  Laura Derns Beauty Regimen      Laura Derns Beauty Regimen   Credit Emily Berl for The New York Times       I use foundation only rarely. If its work, the makeup artists tend to use Cle de Peau . But on my own time, Ive started using Burberry Fresh Glow BB cream . Im raising two children; I need beauty products with luminescent qualities. Last night I had press until midnight and was at a meeting at 5:15 this morning. I put the cream on with some face oil  Neals Yard has this lovely rosehip oil  and everyone says, Oh, youre so glow-y!

Continue reading the main story         Advertisement   Continue reading the main story       Hair Im a natural blonde. I was a towhead as a kid, and then it got ashier when I was 18. But for film, Ive been colored auburn, strawberry blond and sometimes a little more honey-colored. When I filmed Wilson, we really wanted the character to be trashed, and to look like shes been through a lot. For hair, I had really dark roots, and my colorist of the last 20 years, Johnathan Gale , made it look really fried and bleached at the ends. Now there are these beautiful masks that save me. I like Kerastase . For my cuts, I go to my beloved friend, the brilliant 6-foot-1 Icelandic creature Frida Aradottir, whos one of the most brilliant hair designers. We met on Wild at Heart. When shes not busy  she was Emma Stones hair stylist on La La Land  shell very kindly bring her scissors over.

Right this second Im wearing Jo Malone Dark Amber & Ginger Lily dry body oil . Jo Malone has a really nice vetiver, too. And then I love Annick Goutal Eau dHadrien , and Bottega Veneta has a new one, Eau Sensuelle , that is super-pretty. Then I have this amazing thing: Theres a small group of doctors and scientists who started this line called Happiness Abscissa . They make scents that chemically change your mood  a scent as an antidepressant. I do have to say, sometimes I spray this on, and I absolutely feel good. Diet and Fitness Diet is weird. Its elusive. I just try to listen to my body. Lately, Ive been doing matcha green tea with my whisk, and I really love it. I put manuka honey in it. My children are like: Mom! That honey is odd . But then when they dont feel well, I make them hot water with fresh ginger, manuka honey and a dash of cayenne. Drink that tea, and life is good. The kids are actually very healthy. My son is an impassioned surfer and into healthy foods and juices. We dont have a lot of gluten and dairy in the house. The fitness part, its literally whatever I can get whenever I can get it. Before kids, it used to be an hour and a half of yoga in the morning. Now I try to fit in some exercise on a dog walk. As a working parent, youre just constantly trying to fit it all in.

(Her cellphone quacks for incoming calls. Everyone is upset by that, but it makes sure that I hear it, she said.)  Which is not to suggest that she is insensible to the changes brewing in the fashion industry, citing the ever-increasing pace as one of the reasons for leaving her full-time Vogue position.  There are just so many designers, she said. Seems like theres too many. Certainly too many fashion shows. I cant really see where its going  on a website, isnt it?

The original caption reads: Greg Grey Cloud and a group of Lakota riders confront North Dakota police after the Dakota Access Pipeline project received full government approval. Daniella Zalcman is the photographer, and she provided this additional information to The Times: The ceremony was part of a traditional horse presentation, and entirely peaceful, though they did manage to push the police line back to the other side of the entrance to the construction site. Over the course of the next several months, the protest swelled to a camp of as many as 8,000, with Indigenous representatives coming from as far away as New Zealand, Norway and the Amazon to express solidarity. In December, the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe won a major victory in its battle to block the pipeline being built near its reservation when the Department of the Army announced that it would not allow the pipeline to be drilled under a dammed section of the Missouri River. However, President Trump supports the construction of the pipeline, and on Feb. 7, the Army announced it would allow the project to move forward, paving the way for an infrastructure project that has been surrounded by protest and controversy.

And Thats 4 Real  by A.O. Smith: Popstar: Never Stop Never Stopping, a feature-length fake documentary that sends up everyone from Justin Bieber to Justin Timberlake, does not so much break ground as provide welcome fan service. (Mr. Timberlake has a small role as the main characters personal chef.) The Lonely Island may be best in small doses, but there is just about enough goofiness here to fill an hour and a half. The performances and videos are the best part, of course  inspired and inventive beats and ballads that have sufficient musical integrity to make them credible jokes. And the films structure, which evokes the shiny, breathless vacuity of all-access promotional documentaries like Katy Perry: Part of Me, does not crowd the riffing and noodling with too much plot or sentiment.  ... Their testimony represents the movies slyest joke and its most revealing fantasy. Nearly all these musicians  they include Questlove, RZA, Usher, Nas  are black, and members of the unimpeachable hip-hop and R&B royalty that young white men like Conner, Owen and Lawrence (which is also to say the guys who play them) would grow up idolizing. Popstar reverses the idolatry , which is hilarious on its face and also a gesture in the direction of some of the cultural taboos and conundrums that stretch back through the history of American popular music from Eminem to Elvis Presley to the arrival of the banjo. _________   Think you know idolatry?

A film crew from Sky Sports had joined Michael van Gerwen in Oldham on Friday to have him pantomime and pose in front of a green screen for a series of television spots.

The answers they gave me were satisfying in the extreme: not very much, just kick back, hang out, look things over, take it slow. It was 1974. Thats what you were supposed to say.  ... So, what are you doing after graduation? Thirty-five years later, a college teacher, I ask my students the old question. They arent inclined to dissimulate now. The culture is on their side when they tell me about law school and med school and higher degrees in journalism and business; or when they talk about a research grant in China or a well-paying gig teaching English in Japan. _________   Think you know dissimulate?

What is it with the relationship between people and things, anyway  this human drive to have more and more? Collecting can, of course, be practical: Libraries and museums are valuable utilities.

Image Middlebury College students turning their backs on a lecturer, Charles Murray. Credit Lisa Rathke/Associated Press By  Caroline Crosson Gilpin March 9, 2017 The First Amendment to the United States Constitution protects speech no matter how offensive its content. What happens when the speech is hateful or bigoted, racist or sexist? If academic freedom is a bedrock of education in a free society, what is the responsibility of higher education when it comes to wildly unpopular speech? Should controversial speakers  what t he Times editorial board calls despised dissenters  be allowed to present their ideas to students and faculty? Is there any benefit to hearing the thoughts and views of those with whom you vehemently disagree? Why or why not? In the news article headlined Protesters Disrupt Speech by Bell Curve Author at Vermont College , Katherine Q. Seelye writes: Hundreds of students at Middlebury College in Vermont shouted down a controversial speaker on Thursday night, disrupting a program and confronting the speaker in an encounter that turned violent and left a faculty member injured. Laurie L. Patton, the president of the college, issued an apology on Friday to all who attended the event and to the speaker, Charles Murray, 74, whose book The Bell Curve, published in 1994, was an explosive treatise arguing that blacks were intellectually inferior to whites because of their genetic makeup. Today our community begins the process of addressing the deep and troubling divisions that were on display last night, Ms. Patton said in her statement, adding that the Middlebury community had failed to live up to our core values. She said that some of the protesters appeared to be from elsewhere but that Middlebury students had also been involved. The chaotic scene at the small liberal arts college in Vermont drew sharp criticism from the right. Conservatives said that the students were intolerant, had engaged in mob mentality and were quashing free speech, while those on the left maintained that the speaker was racist and hateful and had no place on their campus. Students: Read the entire article, then tell us:  Should despised dissenters be allowed to speak on college campuses? Why or why not?  Does the aggression against Mr. Murray and the professor who invited him to Middlebury College promote, inhibit or complicate free speech? Why do you think so?  Do colleges, universities, faculties and students have a duty to exemplify how to debate unpopular ideas with civility? Why or why not?

Do you want to give? Do you think about what they will use the money for, if you do give? Or, do you think the request for help is a scam? Do you try to get away as fast as possible? What thoughts run through your head when you see a person asking for money on the street? And, if you dont tend to encounter panhandlers, what do you think would cross your mind if you did? In  The Pope on Panhandling: Give Without Worry , The New York Times Editorial Board writes: New Yorkers, if not city dwellers everywhere, might acknowledge a debt to Pope Francis this week. He has offered a concrete, permanently useful prescription for dealing with panhandlers.  Its this: Give them the money, and dont worry about it.  The popes advice, from an interview with a Milan magazine published just before the beginning of Lent, is startlingly simple. Its scripturally sound , yet possibly confounding, even subversive.  Living in the city  especially in metropolises where homelessness is an unsolved, unending crisis  means that at some point in your day, or week, a person seeming (or claiming) to be homeless, or suffering with a disability, will ask you for help.  You probably already have a panhandler policy.  You keep walking, or not. You give, or not. Loose coins, a dollar, or just a shake of the head. Your rule may be blanket, or case-by-case.  If its case-by-case, that means you have your own on-the-spot, individualized benefits program, with a bit of means-testing, mental health and character assessment, and criminal-background check  to the extent that any of this is possible from a second or two of looking someone up and down.  Francis solution eliminates that effort. But it is by no means effortless. Students: Read the entire article, then tell us:  Do you agree with Pope Franciss reasoning for giving money to panhandlers? Why or why not?  In some cities, giving money to panhandlers is illegal. Would the illegality of giving make it easier for you not to give, if you didnt want to? And would the reverse be true? Would you be more apt to give money to those on the street, knowing it was legal to give? Does the status of the law have any bearing on your decision to give, or not? Why or why not?    What is your criteria for giving, or not giving, money to people asking for it on the street? How do you make your decision, and what factors come into play when you decide?
