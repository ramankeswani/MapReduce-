The original caption reads: Taken during Derby weekend in Wyandotte, the neighborhood on the outskirts of Churchill Downs, where the Kentucky Derby is held each May. Louisville, Ky. 2015. Peter van Agtmael is the photographer. In the related article  Home From War, Yet Still Fighting , Jordan G. Teicher writes: The America portrayed in Peter van Agtmaels sweeping new book is a country unable, or unwilling, to reckon with its seemingly limitless appetite for destruction.  Perhaps its an inevitable perspective for someone who has spent much of his career as a conflict photographer in Iraq and Afghanistan, close to the most expansive manifestations of that violent tendency.  Mr. van Agtmael , a member of Magnum, looked at those wars through the experiences of soldiers in battle and, later, back home in his 2014 book, Disco Night Sept 11. In Buzzing at the Sill, which Kehrer Verlag published this month, the wars form the largely unseen psychological and emotional backdrop to a deeply personal examination of the countrys excesses and injustices.  The fact is my vision of America is in some degree sharpened and to some degree clouded by my experiences of America at war, Mr. van Agtmael said. Those experiences are going to color my perceptions throughout my life. They force me to dig under the cushions a bit, dig into the cracks and into the margins to find my own reality.  That impulse took Mr. van Agtmael, in trips around the country from 2009 to 2016, to places  like the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation and post-Katrina New Orleans  where the discrepancies between Americas stated values and its policies are often devastatingly apparent. The result is a portrait of a people living in the brutal shadow of racism, killings and economic inequity.  Continue reading the main story        Were interested in your feedback on this page.

The theory of gravitation will not find its way into my colleagues heads for a long time yet, no doubt, he lamented to a friend in 1915.  Some of the barriers to acceptance were conceptual. Isaac Newton had argued that there was a universal force of gravity, the incessant tugging of one body on another. But Einstein argued that there was no force of gravity at all. Space and time were as wobbly as a trampoline; they could warp, bend or distend in the presence of massive objects like the sun. Objects simply moved as straight as they could, flowing through curved space-time. This idea could be hard to wrap your head around. _________   Think you know distend?

If you were less approving, the tightly controlled smile could be seen as supercilious .  Is it patronizing? Is it condescending? Mr. Embry, speaking before the performance, wondered.

Credit Danny Lyon/Magnum Photos     Of the millions of photographs or images you have viewed in your lifetime, are there any that stand out? Is there just one that pops into your mind? Why? What is it that makes a photograph memorable? In  A Photograph Never Stands Alone , Teju Cole writes: Images make us think of other images. Photographs remind us of other photographs, and perhaps only the earliest photographs had a chance to evade this fate. But soon after the invention of photography, the world was full of photographs, and newly made photographs could not avoid semantic contamination. Each photograph came to seem like a quotation from the great archive of photographs. Even the earliest photographs are themselves now burdened by this reality, because when we look at them, we do so in the knowledge of everything that came after. All images, regardless of the date of their creation, exist simultaneously and are pressed into service to help us make sense of other images. This suggests a possible approach to photography criticism: a river of interconnected images wordlessly but fluently commenting on one another.  But words have their place, too, and what goes without saying often needs to be primed with speech. The images that associatively come to my mind when I look at The Cotton Pickers are highly personal, but they remain opaque until I name them. The pattern of the cotton field in Lyons photograph reminds me of something the great art critic John Berger once wrote: that when we look at a star-filled night sky, we are able to tell stories about it only by organizing the stars into constellations. A strong photograph like The Cotton Pickers is like a star on a clear night. We can track it better when we locate it in relation to other stars. Students: Read the entire article, then tell us:  To you, what is it about a photograph that makes it especially meaningful or memorable? Why?  How are activist pictures that change the way people think about a topic or event different from other images?    Are photos that both shock and move us to a moral response and generate an aesthetic response the most effective or memorable images of all? Why or why not?

Credit Jason Henry for The New York Times     Have you noticed that people your age spend more time on interactive media than they do using marijuana or other drugs? If so, do you think interactive media somehow satisfies similar needs or impulses as drug experimentation? In  Are Teenagers Replacing Drugs With Smartphones? , Matt Richtel writes: Amid an opioid epidemic, the rise of deadly synthetic drugs and the widening legalization of marijuana, a curious bright spot has emerged in the youth drug culture: American teenagers are growing less likely to try or regularly use drugs, including alcohol.  With minor fits and starts, the trend has been building for a decade, with no clear understanding as to why. Some experts theorize that falling cigarette-smoking rates are cutting into a key gateway to drugs, or that antidrug education campaigns, long a largely failed enterprise, have finally taken hold.  But researchers are starting to ponder an intriguing question: Are teenagers using drugs less in part because they are constantly stimulated and entertained by their computers and phones?  The possibility is worth exploring, they say, because use of smartphones and tablets has exploded over the same period that drug use has declined. This correlation does not mean that one phenomenon is causing the other, but scientists say interactive media appears to play to similar impulses as drug experimentation, including sensation-seeking and the desire for independence.  Or it might be that gadgets simply absorb a lot of time that could be used for other pursuits, including partying.  Nora Volkow , director of the National Institute on Drug Abuse, says she plans to begin research on the topic in the next few months, and will convene a group of scholars in April to discuss it. The possibility that smartphones were contributing to a decline in drug use by teenagers, Dr. Volkow said, was the first question she asked when she saw the agencys most recent survey results. The survey,  Monitoring the Future , an annual government-funded report measuring drug use by teenagers, found that past-year use of illicit drugs other than marijuana was at the lowest level in the 40-year history of the project for eighth, 10th and 12th graders.  Use of marijuana is down over the past decade for eighth and 10th graders even as social acceptability is up, the study found. Though marijuana use has risen among 12th graders, the use of cocaine, hallucinogens, ecstasy and crack are all down, too, while LSD use has remained steady.  Even as heroin use has become an epidemic among adults in some communities, it has fallen among high schoolers over the past decade, the study found. Students: Read the entire article, then tell us:  Do you agree with Dr. Nora Volkow when she talks about interactive media and says teens can get literally high when playing these games? Why or why not?  In your experience, is this article right? Are teenagers replacing drugs with smartphones and computers? And if they are, is it because of the entertaining nature of the devices or the dopamine rush, or is there some other reason?    Is smartphone use better or worse for teenagers than drug use?

Did you have any conversations with parents or family members at home? What was talked about, and how did the conversation start? Describe what you can remember. In  Are We Raising Racists? , Jennifer Harvey writes: Last year at this time, my 7-year-old was running around singing the praises of George Washington. I was happy to see her so engaged with what shed learned at school. But I was dismayed that the peace- and diversity-centered curriculum she gets at her public school had left her with such a one-dimensional view of history.  I struggled with how best to respond. Then one morning, she overheard the news on our kitchen radio about a politician charged with ethics violations. Whats that about? she asked.  I told her someone in the government had done something wrong, and she asked how an adult who was a leader could possibly do something bad.  Unfortunately, I responded, a lot of our countrys leaders have done bad things.  When her eyes grew big and she said, Like who and what did they do? I knew I had my opportunity.  Well, I said, you know how youve been running around here celebrating George Washington? We always talk about George Washington fighting for freedom. But George Washington also owned black people as slaves.  Her intrigue turned to horror.  Fast forward, one year. For those of us raising children, the future couldnt be more on our minds. With the news full of reports about vandalized Jewish cemeteries and mosques on fire , police officers who terrorize and endanger black and Latino children , and engineers from India being shot while enjoying a meal after work, its tempting to shut off the radio, turn off the TV and cancel those news alerts on our cellphones. But its more critical than ever that we talk about difficult and morally complex issues with our children. Students: Read the entire article, then tell us:  Did you ever have any realizations about racism or sexism as a child, the way the 7-year-old in the article did when she learned about George Washington owning slaves? How did those moments change or shape you?  Do you agree that white children need to be taught about racism early on, around age 5, to recognize differential treatment and understand about the social status of different racial groups, their own group and others? Why or why not?    In your opinion, how and when should parents discuss this topic with their children?  What are the consequences of children not being taught about racism in a thoughtful way?
