Flynn would be called before the panel to testify.   Credit Gabriella Demczuk for The New York Times     WASHINGTON  It does most of its work in secret, can be highly partisan and its members consider it a thankless job with few political benefits. But the Senate Intelligence Committee is suddenly central to a capital increasingly rattled by Trump administration turmoil. With House Republicans showing little appetite for pursuing an inquiry into links between Russia and the new White House and the chances remote of an independent investigative commission being created, the Senate panel has  at least for the moment  chief responsibility for getting to the bottom of events surrounding the resignation of Michael T. Flynn as national security adviser and any foreign meddling in the presidential election. Whether members of the committee can succeed is a vexing question. The panel split bitterly over an investigation into George W. Bush-era torture of terror detainees, and Senate Republicans are leery of being lured into a Democratic effort to undermine a new Republican president who could help them achieve their long-sought legislative goals. Senator Richard M. Burr, the North Carolina Republican who leads the committee, last month indicated some reluctance about pursuing contacts between the Trump team and Russia before he and Senator Mark Warner of Virginia, who has taken over the top Democratic spot on the panel, one day later issued a letter saying the committee would seek to have a full understanding of the scope of Russian intelligence activities impacting the United States. The clear sense on Capitol Hill was that Mr. Warner had dragged his Republican colleague into accepting an aggressive inquiry.

As the Senate voted Tuesday morning, Republican members of the panel huddled on the Senate floor to plot their way forward.  Photo        Senator Richard M.

Continue reading the main story         Advertisement   Continue reading the main story       I dont think there is anything I have been involved in in my tenure in the Senate that is as important as this, Mr. Warner said. This is about our basic democratic processes. Some of his fellow Democrats are not happy that the bulk of the inquiry will remain the purview of the intelligence panel given that much of its deliberations are conducted in secure rooms of the Capitol complex, away from the prying eyes of the news media and the public. Senator Claire McCaskill, Democrat of Missouri, said that is a principal reason Republicans want to relegate it to the intelligence panel, and she called on Republicans to put aside a desire to protect President Trump and to create a special committee to investigate this matter in a thorough, public and responsible way. Republicans need to look in the mirror and do a gut check, she said. At the moment, Republican leaders seem to be in no mood to add to the furor surrounding the White House by forging ahead with such a special panel, pointing instead to what Senator Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky and the majority leader, called the broad discretion the committee has to look at intelligence matters. Creating a special committee or commission would require the consent of both parties, and the idea is more likely to gain traction if the Intelligence Committee or others in Congress pursuing questions about Russia uncover compelling evidence that would make it hard to resist demands for a deeper, more public investigation. The special national commission on the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks was created only after a special joint investigation by the intelligence committees of the House and Senate conducted its own inquiry that raised new questions. Members of the intelligence panel have multiple motivations for taking a forceful stance after Mr. Flynns resignation. Given heightened attention to the issue, lawmakers know they risk losing control of the investigation if they are seen as not being aggressive. Neither Democrats nor Republicans who sit on the committee  their work often unsung with constituents back home because of secrecy  want to see that.

Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   On Tuesday, Mr. McConnell said it was highly likely the committees investigation would expand beyond election interference to include Mr. Flynns activities. Senator Roy Blunt, Republican of Missouri, who sits on the Intelligence Committee, predicted Mr. Flynn would be called before the panel to testify about both postelection activities and any other activities that he would be aware of. Mr. Blunt, a member of the leadership with sharp political instincts, will be a Republican committee member to watch along with fellow Republican senators like Susan Collins of Maine, a centrist who has challenged Mr. Trump on other issues, and Marco Rubio of Florida, a sometime Trump critic who has urged the administration to take a hard line against Russia. Democrats will do what they can as members of the minority party to push the investigation and try to force it into public view. My goal here is not to have some report that ends up on a shelf, Mr. Warner said. My goal is that while we protect sources and methods, have as much of this information as possible out to the public. The public deserves to know what happened, how it happened and what effects it had on our democratic process. As they looked ahead, uneasy lawmakers worried that this matter and others might not end well for the administration. The beginning has not been so great, either.

Credit Sam Hodgson for The New York Times By  Michael S. Schmidt , Mark Mazzetti and Matt Apuzzo Feb. 14, 2017 WASHINGTON  Phone records and intercepted calls show that members of Donald J. Trumps 2016 presidential campaign and other Trump associates had repeated contacts with senior Russian intelligence officials in the year before the election, according to four current and former American officials. American law enforcement and intelligence agencies intercepted the communications around the same time they were discovering evidence that Russia was trying to disrupt the presidential election by hacking into the Democratic National Committee, three of the officials said. The intelligence agencies then sought to learn whether the Trump campaign was colluding with the Russians on the hacking or other efforts to influence the election. The officials interviewed in recent weeks said that, so far, they had seen no evidence of such cooperation. But the intercepts alarmed American intelligence and law enforcement agencies, in part because of the amount of contact that was occurring while Mr. Trump was speaking glowingly about the Russian president, Vladimir V. Putin. At one point last summer, Mr. Trump said at a campaign event that he hoped Russian intelligence services had stolen Hillary Clintons emails and would make them public. The officials said the intercepted communications were not limited to Trump campaign officials, and included other associates of Mr. Trump. On the Russian side, the contacts also included members of the government outside of the intelligence services, they said. All of the current and former officials spoke on the condition of anonymity because the continuing investigation is classified. The officials said that one of the advisers picked up on the calls was Paul Manafort, who was Mr. Trumps campaign chairman for several months last year and had worked as a political consultant in Ukraine. The officials declined to identify the other Trump associates on the calls. The call logs and intercepted communications are part of a larger trove of information that the F.B.I. is sifting through as it investigates the links between Mr. Trumps associates and the Russian government, as well as the hacking of the D.N.C. , according to federal law enforcement officials. As part of its inquiry, the F.B.I. has obtained banking and travel records and conducted interviews, the officials said. Mr. Manafort, who has not been charged with any crimes, dismissed the officials accounts in a telephone interview on Tuesday. This is absurd, he said. I have no idea what this is referring to. I have never knowingly spoken to Russian intelligence officers, and I have never been involved with anything to do with the Russian government or the Putin administration or any other issues under investigation today. He added, Its not like these people wear badges that say, Im a Russian intelligence officer. Several of Mr. Trumps associates, like Mr. Manafort, have done business in Russia. And it is not unusual for American businessmen to come in contact with foreign intelligence officials, sometimes unwittingly, in countries like Russia and Ukraine, where the spy services are deeply embedded in society. Law enforcement officials did not say to what extent the contacts might have been about business. The officials would not disclose many details, including what was discussed on the calls, the identity of the Russian intelligence officials who participated, and how many of Mr. Trumps advisers were talking to the Russians. It is also unclear whether the conversations had anything to do with Mr. Trump himself. A report from American intelligence agencies that was made public in January concluded that the Russian government had intervened in the election in part to help Mr. Trump, but did not address whether any members of the Trump campaign had participated in the effort. The intercepted calls are different from the wiretapped conversations last year between Michael T. Flynn, Mr. Trumps former national security adviser, and Sergey I. Kislyak, Russias ambassador to the United States. In those calls, which led to Mr. Flynns resignation on Monday night, the two men discussed sanctions that the Obama administration imposed on Russia in December. But the cases are part of American intelligence and law enforcement agencies routine electronic surveillance of the communications of foreign officials. The F.B.I. declined to comment. The White House also declined to comment Tuesday night, but earlier in the day, the press secretary, Sean Spicer, stood by Mr. Trumps previous comments that nobody from his campaign had contact with Russian officials before the election. Theres nothing that would conclude me that anything different has changed with respect to that time period, Mr. Spicer said in response to a question. Two days after the election in November, Sergei A. Ryabkov, the deputy Russian foreign minister, said there were contacts during the campaign between Russian officials and Mr. Trumps team. Obviously, we know most of the people from his entourage, Mr. Ryabkov told Russias Interfax news agency. The Trump transition team denied Mr. Ryabkovs statement. This is not accurate, Hope Hicks, a spokeswoman for Mr. Trump, said at the time. The National Security Agency, which monitors the communications of foreign intelligence services, initially captured the calls between Mr. Trumps associates and the Russians as part of routine foreign surveillance. After that, the F.B.I. asked the N.S.A. to collect as much information as possible about the Russian operatives on the phone calls, and to search through troves of previous intercepted communications that had not been analyzed. The F.B.I. has closely examined at least three other people close to Mr. Trump, although it is unclear if their calls were intercepted. They are Carter Page , a businessman and former foreign policy adviser to the campaign; Roger Stone, a longtime Republican operative; and Mr. Flynn. All of the men have strongly denied that they had any improper contacts with Russian officials. As part of the inquiry, the F.B.I. is also trying to assess the credibility of the information contained in a dossier that was given to the bureau last year by a former British intelligence operative. The dossier contained a raft of allegations of a broad conspiracy between Mr. Trump, his associates and the Russian government. It also included unsubstantiated claims that the Russians had embarrassing videos that could be used to blackmail Mr. Trump. The F.B.I. has spent several months investigating the leads in the dossier, but has yet to confirm any of its most explosive claims. Senior F.B.I. officials believe that the former British intelligence officer who compiled the dossier, Christopher Steele, has a credible track record , and he briefed investigators last year about how he obtained the information. One American law enforcement official said that F.B.I. agents had made contact with some of Mr. Steeles sources. The agencys investigation of Mr. Manafort began last spring as an outgrowth of a criminal investigation into his work for a pro-Russian political party in Ukraine and for the countrys former president, Viktor F. Yanukovych. It has focused on why he was in such close contact with Russian and Ukrainian intelligence officials. The bureau did not have enough evidence to obtain a warrant for a wiretap of Mr. Manaforts communications, but it had the N.S.A. scrutinize the communications of Ukrainian officials he had met. The F.B.I. investigation is proceeding at the same time that separate investigations into Russian interference in the election are gaining momentum on Capitol Hill. Those investigations, by the House and Senate Intelligence Committees, are examining not only the Russian hacking but also any contacts that Mr. Trumps team had with Russian officials during the campaign. On Tuesday, top Republican lawmakers said that Mr. Flynn should be one focus of the investigation, and that he should be called to testify before Congress. Senator Mark Warner of Virginia, the top Democrat on the Intelligence Committee, said the news about Mr. Flynn underscored how many questions still remain unanswered to the American people more than three months after Election Day, including who was aware of what, and when. Mr. Warner said Mr. Flynns resignation would not stop the committee from continuing to investigate General Flynn, or any other campaign official who may have had inappropriate and improper contacts with Russian officials prior to the election. Correction :  An earlier version of this article misstated the number of people (in addition to Paul Manafort) whom the F.B.I. has examined. It is at least three, not at least four. Correction :  An earlier version of a photo caption with this article gave an incorrect middle initial for Paul Manafort. It is J., not D. Adam Goldman and Matthew Rosenberg contributed reporting.

Feinberg, right, a founder of Cerberus Capital Management, at the Capitol in December 2008. He is said to be in talks for a White House role examining the countrys intelligence agencies.   Credit Brendan Smialowski for The New York Times     WASHINGTON  President Trump plans to assign a New York billionaire to lead a broad review of American intelligence agencies, according to administration officials, an effort that members of the intelligence community fear could curtail their independence and reduce the flow of information that contradicts the presidents worldview. The possible role for Stephen A. Feinberg, a co-founder of Cerberus Capital Management, has met fierce resistance among intelligence officials already on edge because of the criticism the intelligence community has received from Mr. Trump during the campaign and since he became president. On Wednesday, Mr. Trump blamed leaks from the intelligence community for the departure of Michael T. Flynn, his national security adviser, whose resignation he requested. There has been no announcement of Mr. Feinbergs job, which would be based in the White House, but he recently told his companys shareholders that he is in discussions to join the Trump administration. He is a member of Mr. Trumps economic advisory council . Mr. Feinberg, who has close ties to Stephen K. Bannon, Mr. Trumps chief strategist, and Jared Kushner, the presidents son-in-law, declined to comment on his possible position. The White House, which is still working out the details of the intelligence review, also would not comment.  Photo        Stephen K. Bannon, the presidents chief strategist, and Jared Kushner, Mr. Trumps son-in-law, in the Oval Office this month. Mr. Feinberg has close ties to both men.   Credit Al Drago/The New York Times    Bringing Mr. Feinberg into the administration to conduct the review is seen as a way of injecting a Trump loyalist into a world the White House views with suspicion. But top intelligence officials fear that Mr. Feinberg is being groomed for a high position in one of the intelligence agencies.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   Mr. Bannon and Mr. Kushner, according to current and former intelligence officials and Republican lawmakers, had at one point considered Mr. Feinberg for either director of national intelligence or chief of the Central Intelligence Agencys clandestine service, a role that is normally reserved for career intelligence officers, not friends of the president. Mr. Feinbergs only experience with national security matters is his firms stakes in a private security company and two gun makers.  Continue reading the main story         Advertisement   Continue reading the main story       On an array of issues  including the Iran nuclear deal, the utility of NATO, and how best to combat Islamist militancy  much of the information and analysis produced by American intelligence agencies contradicts the policy positions of the new administration. The divide is starkest when it comes to Russia and President Vladimir V. Putin, whom Mr. Trump has repeatedly praised while dismissing American intelligence assessments that Moscow sought to promote his own candidacy.   The real scandal here is that classified information is illegally given out by "intelligence" like candy. Very un-American! 
        Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) Feb. 15, 2017     Against this backdrop, Mr. Trump has appointed Mike Pompeo, a former Republican congressman from Kansas, to run the C.I.A., and former Senator Dan Coats, an Indiana Republican, to be the director of national intelligence (he is still awaiting confirmation). Both were the preferred choices of the Republican congressional leadership and Vice President Mike Pence and had no close or longstanding ties to Mr. Trump. In fact, they each endorsed Senator Marco Rubio of Florida for president during the 2016 Republican primaries. But the potential White House role for Mr. Feinberg follows intense speculation among intelligence professionals that Mr. Feinberg is in line for a powerful position within the intelligence community.

The last time an outsider with no intelligence experience took the job was in the early days of the Reagan administration, when Max Hugel, a businessman who had worked on Mr. Reagans campaign, was named to run the spy service. His tenure at the C.I.A. was marked by turmoil and questions about the politicization of the agency. He was forced to resign after six months, amid accusations about his past business dealings. (He later won a libel case against the two brothers who made the accusations.) Even the prospect that Mr. Feinberg may lead a review for the White House has raised concerns in the intelligence community. Mr. Coats is especially angry at what he sees as a move by Mr. Bannon and Mr. Kushner to sideline him before he is even confirmed, according to current and former officials. He believes the review would impinge on a central part of his role as the director of national intelligence and fears that if Mr. Feinberg were working at the White House, he could quickly become a dominant voice on intelligence matters.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   Michael V. Hayden, a retired general who ran the C.I.A. and the National Security Agency during President George W. Bushs administration, said it was hard to wrap his head around the idea of a D.N.I. nominee in the confirmation process while others consider retooling the position.  Photo        Mike Pompeo, center, the C.I.A. director, being sworn in last month by Vice President Mike Pence. Mr. Pompeo does not see an urgent need for a review of the intelligence community.   Credit Doug Mills/The New York Times    I think Id be concerned, too, he said. The challenge is less immediate for Mr. Pompeo. He does not see an urgent need for a review of the intelligence community, according to current and former American officials, but sees it as better than the appointment of Mr. Feinberg to a job with actual authority over daily intelligence operations. Many intelligence officials question what purpose a White House intelligence review would serve other than to position Mr. Feinberg for a larger role in the future. Most significant changes to the intelligence community would require an act of Congress, a fact that would ultimately blunt whatever ideas or proposals Mr. Feinberg came up with. Even with a Republican majority in both houses, getting Congress to agree to major changes to intelligence agencies seems unlikely. It is difficult to object to someone putting fresh eyes on the organization of the intelligence community, Mr. Hayden said. But, even though the D.N.I. staff has become far too large, I dont think any of us think a major restructuring of the community is in order. Tensions between the intelligence community and the White House have already played out on several fronts. Before Mr. Flynn was forced out, one of his top aides, Robin Townley, was denied a security clearance by the C.I.A. But distrust of the intelligence community has been building for years in conservative political circles, where the C.I.A. during the Obama administration was seen as heavily politicized. Representative Steve King, Republican of Iowa, said in a recent interview that some officials in the intelligence community were trustworthy but not all.   Got a confidential news tip?  The New York Times would like to hear from readers who want to share messages and materials with our journalists.         Learn More          People there need to be rooted out, Mr. King said. Another Republican lawmaker said that the predominant view at the White House is also that the politicians in the intelligence agencies need to be cleaned out. Through Cerberus, his private equity company, Mr. Feinberg has strong ties to the government contracting industry. Cerberus owns DynCorp International, which has had a wide array of large contracts providing security to the State Department and other agencies. DynCorp is now locked in a major legal dispute over the fate of a $10 billion State Department contract that it previously held to provide air support for counternarcotics operations overseas.

Cerberus also owns Remington Outdoor, a major firearms manufacturer. In 2008, Mr. Feinberg also considered investing in Blackwater, the security firm founded by Erik Prince, a former member of the Navy SEALs, before it was ultimately acquired by other investors. New York magazine reported last year that Mr. Feinberg went to Blackwaters North Carolina compound in 2005 to take firearms training .

Peskov, in New York in November. He denied outright that Michael T. Flynn had discussed sanctions with the Russian ambassador to Washington.   Credit Misha Friedman for The New York Times     MOSCOW  Russia dismissed a New York Times article published Tuesday night that concluded that members of Donald J. Trump s 2016 presidential campaign and other Trump associates had repeated contacts with senior Russian intelligence officials in the year before the election. The Kremlins spokesman, Dmitri S. Peskov, said on Wednesday that the Times article and one published by CNN were not based on facts and do not indicate any specific facts, either. The statement from Mr. Peskov was more foggy than the usual flat denial from the Kremlin, but it followed on the heels of an embarrassing episode. On Friday, Mr. Peskov denied outright that Michael T. Flynn had discussed sanctions with the Russian ambassador to Washington, Sergey I. Kislyak. But by Monday, Mr. Flynn admitted that he had. A short while later, President Trump wrote on Twitter : Crimea was TAKEN by Russia during the Obama Administration. Was Obama too soft on Russia?   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   The message could be seen as a way to shift away from the mounting controversies in Washington, and to portray Mr. Trump  whom Hillary Clinton had called a puppet of the Russian president  as taking a harder line on Russia.  Continue reading the main story         Advertisement   Continue reading the main story       We do not return our territories, Maria V. Zakharova, a spokeswoman for the Russian Foreign Ministry, told journalists at a regular news briefing on Wednesday. Crimea is Russian territory. Vyacheslav V. Volodin, speaker of the lower house of Parliament, called on Wednesday for Mr. Trump to keep his campaign promise of rebuilding relations with Russia, and he declared that Crimea is a part of Russia. The messages out of Moscow reflected a confusing picture in Washington, where Mr. Trump was trying to appear tough on Russia even as his fiercest critics suggested that the Russians might have an undue influence over him. Unlike the Trump administration, Russian officials never disputed that there were ties between Mr. Trumps circle and Russian officials. Two days after the Nov. 8 election, Sergei A. Ryabkov, Russias deputy foreign minister, said there were contacts during the campaign between Russian officials and Mr. Trumps team. Trump transition officials denied that assertion. It is clear that people who are called as being part of his entourage, for the most part, are known to us, Mr. Rybakov said at the time. These are people who were always on display, who occupied important posts. He continued, I wouldnt say that all of them, but quite a few of them, were in touch with the Russian representatives. Mr. Flynn resigned as national security adviser Monday night after revelations that he had misled Vice President Mike Pence about the nature of his Russia contacts .   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   In particular, the talks involved new sanctions that the Obama administration had imposed in retaliation for Russian meddling in the election. Trump administration officials, based on incomplete information from Mr. Flynn, had denied that the sanctions were discussed. (Mr. Peskov told journalists on Friday that some conversations between Mr. Flynn and Mr. Kislyak took place, but he did not provide details.) Mr. Peskov did not directly dispute the Times article  or a CNN article that found that high-level advisers close to then-presidential nominee Donald Trump were in constant communication during the campaign with Russians known to U.S. intelligence  but he suggested that the truth was hard to discern.

Privacy Policy  Opt out or contact us anytime      Lets not trust newspaper articles, because it is very difficult to differentiate between what is true and what is fake, Mr. Peskov was quoted by the Russian news agency Interfax as saying. There are references to five sources, but not a single is named. The Times quoted four current or former intelligence officials, who all spoke on the condition of anonymity because the information is classified. Three of the officials said that the American government had intercepted communications between Trump aides or associates and Russian officials, around the same time they were discovering evidence that Moscow was trying to disrupt the presidential election by hacking into the Democratic National Committee. The intelligence agencies then sought to learn if the Trump campaign was colluding with the Russians on the hacking or on other efforts to influence the election. Paul Manafort , who was Mr. Trumps campaign chairman for several months last year, was the only person named as part of the investigation. Mr. Manafort called the report absurd, saying that he had never knowingly spoken to Russian intelligence officers. But the intercepts alarmed American intelligence and law enforcement agencies, in part because of the amount of contact that was occurring while Mr. Trump was speaking glowingly about the Russian president, Vladimir V. Putin. While critical of The Timess sourcing, Mr. Peskov stopped short of denying the essence of the report. Perhaps there is some information, who these people are, when it happened, Mr. Peskov said. Maybe the time will come and somebody will tell about it openly. Lets wait for this time.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   Russias foreign intelligence service, which rarely issues any comments, told the state-run news agency Tass that we do not comment on unsubstantiated insinuations published by the media. Ms. Zakharova, the Foreign Ministry spokeswoman, said on Wednesday that Russian representatives, Russian diplomats were doing the work that is prescribed to them not only by Moscow, but that is a normal practice for diplomats of all countries. This information proves again that there is a large-scale political game inside the American politics, Ms. Zakharova told journalists. Vladimir M. Dzhabarov, first deputy chairman of the foreign affairs committee of the upper house of Parliament, told the state-owned news agency RIA Novosti that the leaks in the United States could harm Mr. Trump. This is a usual practice used to attempt to compromise an individual, he said. A shadow will be cast, and, one way or another, Mr. Trump will be deprived of his team. He added: Trump should realize that the target of these false stories is he, himself. If the American president will not stop this bacchanalia and will continue to surrender his people, this will end very badly  because the overall aim of his enemies is the U.S. presidents impeachment.

In Dallas, Texas, a charitable foundation intimately associated with the Republic National Bank and other major companies apparently has served as a conduit for at least $580,700 in CIA funds since 1958. One of the foundation trustees is Federal Judge Sarah T. Hughes, who administered the oath of office to President Johnson following the assassination of President Kennedy.  In Houston, another foundation closely identified with the Texas business community has apparently passed on $655,000 in CIA funds since 1958. The foundations attorney and one of its trustees is Leon Jawarski, a friend of Mr. Johnson, who has been rumored from time to time to be in line for appointment as attorney general of the United States.

Robert S. Harward, in 2011.   Credit United States Navy     WASHINGTON  Robert S. Harward, the retired vice admiral who is President Trumps top choice to replace his ousted national security adviser, is a hard-charging member of the Navy SEALs who rose through the ranks to top military positions and is close with Jim Mattis, the new secretary of defense. Mr. Harward, 60, is a former deputy commander of the United States Central Command, the militarys busiest with management of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, and served on the National Security Council under President George W. Bush, where he was responsible for counterterrorism issues. He is currently a top executive at Lockheed Martin, the weapons and aerospace company, overseeing business with the United Arab Emirates. Mr. Harwards career has closely tracked that of Mr. Mattis, from the time the two worked together in Afghanistan after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks of 2001 to his tour at Central Command from 2011 to 2013, which included an assignment heading detainee operations in Kabul. He has faced down and defeated the worlds most ruthless and deadly enemies, and he has done all that by Mattiss side, said Fran Townsend, Mr. Bushs former homeland security adviser, for whom Mr. Harward worked from 2003 to 2005. He has been in tougher knife fights than this, and won.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   Still, it is not clear whether Mr. Harward would be willing to surrender his lucrative position and comfortable existence in Abu Dhabi to step into the tumult of the Trump White House. The new administration has been troubled by an unusual level of infighting, disorganization and grievance  including within the ranks of the National Security Council  capped off on Monday by the resignation of Michael T. Flynn as national security adviser.  Continue reading the main story         Advertisement   Continue reading the main story       Raised in prerevolutionary Tehran, Mr. Harward was known to startle his Afghan counterparts during his tours there by conversing with them fluently in Farsi, which is similar to their native Dari. Trained as an elite Special Operations officer, Mr. Harward is also known for his bravado and obsession with physical fitness. As the head of detainee operations in Afghanistan, he would lead weekly hikes in the mountains outside Kabul, outpacing colleagues who were 20 years younger, and has been known to challenge them to push-up contests that left them vomiting. Mr. Harward looks the part of a battle-hardened military man, a crucial factor for a president who has made clear that he considers appearance an important indicator of a job candidates suitability for a role.

Privacy Policy  Opt out or contact us anytime      With his bald head, ice-blue eyes and long scar of mysterious provenance down his cheek, Mr. Harward has the bearing of an officer who once carried out risky secret operations. But he is also an effective inside player, according to people who know him, having worked for some of the militarys top policy leaders and at the White House. James G. Stavridis, a retired admiral and former NATO commander, said Mr. Harward was someone who will find a way to succeed no matter how daunting the task. I have known him well for two decades, and have boundless admiration for his ingenuity, integrity and ability to navigate choppy seas  both operationally in the field and in the battlefield of Washington, D.C., said Mr. Stavridis, currently dean of the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy at Tufts University. The real question, he added, is whether he wants to take the job. Some question whether Mr. Harwards decades of military experience are the right preparation for a senior policy-making post. In a Twitter post Tuesday, Max Boot , a senior fellow in national security studies at the Council on Foreign Relations, called Mr. Harward a great SEAL, but said it was not clear that running detainee ops in Afghanistan or being No 2 at Centcom is right background for this.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   Friends say Mr. Harward has experience with high-stakes military special operations, but also in navigating the arcane world of the National Security Council, which is charged with synthesizing recommendations from national security and intelligence agencies and advising the president on policy. The process frequently involves managing turf battles and balancing competing interests. Hell bring a buffering calm and balance, as well as his using his previous experience at the N.S.C., said Douglas H. Wise, a former deputy director at the Defense Intelligence Agency . Mr. Mattis is widely seen as a force for steadiness within the Trump administration, and some Republicans who have expressed misgivings about the presidents policies and his attitude toward national security matters have looked to his defense secretary as an island of reliability in a sea of unpredictability.   Got a confidential news tip?  The New York Times would like to hear from readers who want to share messages and materials with our journalists.         Learn More          Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona and chairman of the Armed Services Committee, said on Tuesday that Mr. Trump should name a new national security adviser who is empowered by clear lines of authority and responsibility and possesses the skills and experience necessary to organize the national security system across our government. Mr. McCain said he looked forward to working with the presidents administration, especially Secretary Mattis, to defend the nation and support our military service members. If he is chosen for the post and accepts, Mr. Harward would be reunited with his old boss and mentor, Mr. Mattis. But he would also have to contend with Mr. Trumps inner circle, populated by political advisers with whom Mr. Harward is not familiar, including Steven K. Bannon, the chief White House strategist. In an executive order last month  which Mr. Trump later complained privately that he had not been fully briefed on  the president placed Mr. Bannon on the principals committee of the National Security Council, giving a political adviser a position of parity with the secretaries of state and defense, and with the national security adviser. Two former national security officials who have worked closely with Mr. Harward said he would be unlikely to take the position without strong assurances from Mr. Trump and his team that the council would not be driven by partisan considerations on national security policy, and that he would have the autonomy to provide principled counsel. They spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak on Mr. Harwards behalf.

Petraeus, the former general who was forced to resign as director of the Central Intelligence Agency after admitting that he had provided classified information to his lover, and who is now also said to be in the running to be Mr. Trumps national security adviser. Jill Kelley, a Tampa socialite who had befriended Mr. Petraeus and then become a target of threatening emails from Mr. Petraeus lover, had also written gushing notes to Mr. Harward and Mr. Mattis. You ROCK!!! Ms. Kelley wrote to Mr. Harward in 2012 regarding his dealings with foreign heads of state at a social gathering, according to emails obtained by The Washington Post. YOU ROCK MORE!, Mr. Harward replied. There was no evidence of impropriety in the friendly correspondence, which would have been routine between top military commanders and civic leaders in the communities in which they were stationed.

By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS.  Photo by Thierry Charlier/Agence France-Presse  Getty Images.  Watch in Times Video          embed            BRUSSELS  Defense Secretary Jim Mattis appeared to close the door Thursday on increased military ties between the United States and Russia , dimming, for the moment, prospects that President Trumps election would soon usher in warmer relations. Mr. Mattiss rejection of stronger ties, made during a NATO meeting in Brussels, came amid a flurry of mixed messages about the outlook for improvement in the American-Russian relationship under the Trump administration. He spoke as Gen. Joseph F. Dunford Jr., the top United States military officer, was meeting with his Russian counterpart for the first time in almost three years. And it came on the same day that President Vladimir V. Putin called for Russian intelligence agencies to bolster ties with the American intelligence community in the fight against terrorism. Restoring dialogue with the special services of the United States and other NATO members is in our mutual interest, Mr. Putin told the countrys F.S.B. intelligence agency in a televised speech. His comments, coming as Mr. Trump was using his Twitter account to denounce leaks from the American intelligence community, were greeted with surprise among some United States officials.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   Mr. Mattis, for his part, made clear that his criticism of Russia had not changed. Appearing before reporters, Mr. Mattis, a former Marine general, said Russia needed to live by international law like we expect all mature nations on this planet to do.  Continue reading the main story         Advertisement   Continue reading the main story       There was no doubt, he added, that Russia had interfered or attempted to interfere in a number of elections, implying, although not specifically saying, that the Russians had meddled in the process that led to his own bosss election as president. And while Mr. Mattis said that American political leaders would look for common ground with the Russians, he added that when it came to real intelligence sharing and military cooperation, Russia is going to have to prove itself first. Mr. Mattiss comments are significant because more than any other cabinet member or top administration official, with the possible exception of Stephen K. Bannon, Mr. Trumps chief strategist, he is regarded by Mr. Trump as the most trusted on a number of national security issues. Mr. Trump has moved closer to the views held by Mr. Mattis, including dropping his insistence about using torture; calling for Russia to return Crimea, which it annexed in 2014 ; and Ukraine. At the NATO defense ministers meeting this week, part of the new administrations first diplomatic engagement in Europe, much of the talk in the hallways dwelled on whether Mr. Mattis could continue to move the Trump administration toward positions on national security issues more palatable to the United States European allies. After speaking with Mr. Mattis, we dont have any doubts that the United States will stay committed to NATO, said Raimundas Karoblis, the Lithuanian defense minister. He, like several defense ministers, seemed so relieved to hear Mr. Mattis repeat standard American talking points about its commitment to NATO that he and the others did not complain about the demand the American defense secretary issued on Wednesday, telling them to commit more to military spending or see the United States moderate its commitment to the alliance  whatever that might mean. Pressed on Thursday about what exactly he had meant by what sounded like an ultimatum, Mr. Mattis declined to elaborate, sparing the assembled diplomats from envisioning a pullout of American troops from Europe.

It remains unclear just how long Mr. Mattiss influence over an unpredictable president will last, and officials at the Pentagon have privately speculated about how long Mr. Mattis will last. For now though, he appears to be influencing policy. He told reporters that he had not decided whether to recommend sending more American troops to Syria as part of the campaign to fight the Islamic State, but that he wanted to consult with American allies first and get a better view of the situation in the Middle East. On Wednesday, Mr. Mattis told fellow NATO ministers that he had no illusions about warmer relations with Moscow. The alliance, he said, needed to be realistic in our expectations and ensuring our diplomats negotiate from a position of strength. That statement went over poorly in Moscow. The news agency Tass quoted the Russian defense minister, Sergei K. Shoigu, as saying that attempts to build a dialogue with Russia from a position of strength would be futile. Mr. Mattis gave the verbal equivalent of a shrug. I have no need to respond to the Russian statement at all, he said. In Baku, Azerbaijan, General Dunford met with the head of the Russian military, Gen. Valeriy Gerasimov. The two exchanged their views on the state of U.S.-Russian military relations and of the international security situation in Europe, the Middle East and other key regions, the Defense Department said in a statement after the meeting. Defense officials said that American and Russian officials would continue to try to deconflict their efforts in Syria and that the two generals had agreed to enhance communications on such efforts. General Gerasimov is considered by American military officials to be an expert in so-called hybrid warfare, or war by indirect means, like interfering in elections in other countries.

Turkeys president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, has battled the deep state by conducting vast purges after the failed attempt last year.   Credit Nicole Tung for The New York Times     WASHINGTON  A wave of leaks from government officials has hobbled the Trump administration, leading some to draw comparisons to countries like Egypt, Turkey and Pakistan, where shadowy networks within government bureaucracies, often referred to as deep states, undermine and coerce elected governments. So is the United States seeing the rise of its own deep state? Not quite, experts say, but the echoes are real  and disturbing. Though leaks can be a normal and healthy check on a presidents power, whats happening now extends much further. The United States, those experts warn, risks developing an entrenched culture of conflict between the president and his own bureaucracy. Issandr El Amrani, an analyst who has written on Egypts deep state , said he was concerned by the parallels, though the United States has not reached authoritarian extremes.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   The growing discord between a president and his bureaucratic rank-and-file, he warned, is dangerous, it encourages deep divisions within society, it creates these constant tensions.  Continue reading the main story         Advertisement   Continue reading the main story       As an American citizen I find it really quite disheartening to see all these similarities to Egypt, Mr. El Amrani said. What Makes a Deep State? Though the deep state is sometimes discussed as a shadowy conspiracy, it helps to think of it instead as a political conflict between a nations leader and its governing institutions. That can be deeply destabilizing, leading both sides to wield state powers like the security services or courts against one another, corrupting those institutions in the process. In Egypt, for instance, the military and security services actively undermined Mohamed Morsi , the countrys democratically elected Islamist president, contributing to the upheaval that culminated in his ouster in a 2013 coup. Turkeys president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan , has battled the deep state by consolidating power for himself and, after a failed coup attempt last year, conducting vast purges. Though American democracy is resilient enough to resist such clashes, early hints of a conflict can be tricky to spot because some push and pull between a president and his or her agencies is normal. In 2009, for instance, military officials used leaks to pressure the White House over what it saw as the minimal number of troops necessary to send to Afghanistan.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   Leaks can also be an emergency brake on policies that officials believe could be ill-advised or unlawful, such as George W. Bush-era programs on warrantless wiretapping and the Abu Ghraib detention facility in Iraq. You want these people to be fighting like cats and dogs over what the best policy is, airing their views, making their case and then, when its over, accepting the decision and implementing it, said Elizabeth N. Saunders, a George Washington University political scientist. Thats the way its supposed to work.

Institutional conflicts under Mr. Trump, she worried, had grown into something larger and more concerning. Mr. Trump, apparently seeking to cut the intelligence community, State Department, and other agencies out of the policy-making process almost entirely, may have triggered a conflict whose escalation we are seeing in the rising number of leaks. Culture of Conflict Officials, deprived of the usual levers for shaping policies that are supposed to be their purview, are left with little other than leaking. And the frenetic pace of Mr. Trumps executive orders, which the agencies would normally review internally over weeks or months, has them pulling that lever repeatedly. They have leaked draft executive orders, inciting backlashes that led the orders to be shelved. And they have revealed administration efforts to circumvent usual policymaking channels, undermining Mr. Trumps ability to enact his agenda. Mr. Trumps moves to consolidate power away from those agencies under his own authority also has them struggling to keep what they see as their crucial role in governance. Were in a world now where the president is playing to the edge of his powers, and I think there are real concerns about the constitutional implications of some of the actions hes taken, said Amy Zegart, the co-director of the Center for International Security and Cooperation at Stanford University.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   That has forced officials in agencies to ask how far they will go themselves. As each side begins to perceive itself as under attack and the other as making dangerous power-grabs, it will justify more and more extreme behavior. In President Trump, you have a president whose behavior shocks even more than the content of his policies, Mr. El Amrani said. This was very much the case with Morsi, he said, which led the civil service to leak aggressively to oppose Morsis disregard for bureaucratic norms and procedures. Youre seeing the same thing now. Tit for Tat Mr. Trumps tendency to treat each leak as an attack rather than an attempt to influence policy has created an atmosphere in Washington of open institutional conflict. Some leaks appear motivated by more than mere policy disagreements, such as the revelations concerning conversations between Michael T. Flynn , the national security adviser, and Russias ambassador to the United States, Sergey I. Kislyak, which led on Monday to Mr. Flynns resignation . This came after months of worsening relations between Mr. Trump and the intelligence agencies, which he frequently criticized during his campaign. Mr. Trump, in rejecting intelligence assessments that Russia intervened in the election to help him win, has risked implying that he will only accept intelligence bent to his political interests. Mr. Trump has said he might appoint Stephen A. Feinberg , a finance executive who was an early supporter of his campaign, to review the intelligence agencies.

We explore the deep state.        LISTEN ON YOUR PODCASTS APP    LISTEN ON RADIOPUBLIC             It looks, sounds and feels like a political witch hunt, said Ms. Zegart. Its like pouring gasoline on the fire.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   Whats happening here is that the president doesnt even want to hear intelligence that he doesnt agree with, and jumps to the conclusion that it must be politicized, and must be the result of people conspiring against him, Ms. Zegart said. By creating the perception of conflict, Mr. Trump may have made it more likely. Crossing the Line Mr. Flynn, in his short tenure, exemplified the breakdown between the presidents inner circle and career civil servants. He kept the National Security Council largely shut out of policy-making and sought sweeping changes in foreign policy. For concerned government officials, leaks may have become one of the few remaining means by which to influence not just Mr. Flynns policy initiatives but the threat he seemed to pose to their place in democracy. That has fueled speculation that details of Mr. Flynns contact with the Russian ambassador could have been leaked as much to undermine Mr. Flynn as out of concern for impropriety. Even if that was not the case, such practices are a hazard of officials growing reliance on leaks and other tools of bureaucratic resistance. This risks entrenching a culture of bureaucratic warfare that is adversarial and dysfunctional by default  not quite a Turkish-style deep state, but not a healthy democracy either. Officials are stuck in a difficult position: Even if each individual leak is justifiable, as insubordination becomes more sustained and overt, it inches deeper into the gray zone of counter-democratic activities. The distinction between deep-state meddling and acceptable protest is difficult to draw in the United States, Ms. Zegart said, because this degree of opposition is so unusual. I dont think you can say in advance what inappropriate deep-state activity would look like, because we havent seen this before, she said.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   In countries like Egypt, Mr. El Amrani said, the line is much clearer. There, the deep state is not official institutions rebelling, he said, but rather shadowy networks within those institutions, and within business, who are conspiring together and forming parallel state institutions. Mr. Trump, by treating these institutions as if they are already his political enemies, makes that harder to avoid. Bad for Everyone As that gulf widens, it becomes more likely that mutual mistrust will lead the president and government bureaucracy to actively undermine one another. A lesson of deep states: Even minor decisions become the subject of political infighting, making basic governance difficult. We saw in Egypt in 2013 that the result is complete decision-making paralysis, Mr. El Amrani said. That is one of the milder outcomes. But when institutions with vast power to eavesdrop, fine, harass and detain see themselves as locked in a zero-sum struggle for survival, it is often basic civil liberties and democratic rights that end up in the crossfire. Mr. El Amrani does not believe those worst-case scenarios are likely to come to pass in the United States. But there is still a risk that bureaucratic resistance against the president could become an enduring feature of American politics. Once trust is broken, it is difficult to rebuild. Ms. Zegart agreed. There are no good long-term consequences here, she said. This war between the intelligence community and the White House is bad for the intelligence community, bad for the White House, and bad for the nations security.

During the Vietnam War, Watergate and the Iran-contra scandal, when a presidents actions or policies crossed the line, Congress investigated and held the White House to account. The time has come for it to do so again. In the last week alone, Americans have witnessed the firing of President Trumps national security adviser, Michael Flynn, and learned with shock and incredulity that members of Mr. Trumps campaign and inner circle were in repeated contact with Russian intelligence officials. Coming on top of credible information from Americas intelligence agencies that Russia tried to destabilize and influence the 2016 presidential campaign, these latest revelations are more than sufficient reason for Congress to investigate what Moscow has been up to and whether people at the highest levels of the United States government have aided and abetted the interests of a nation that has tried to thwart American foreign policy since the Cold War. Given that context, one might expect Mr. Trump to be clamoring for details that would eliminate any suspicion that his administration is in league with an enemy. Instead he has waged an unhinged attack on the intelligence agencies themselves, praising President Vladimir Putin of Russia at every turn and pointing fingers everywhere but at himself, while refusing to take a single step to resolve questions about his administrations ties to Russia. Hence the urgent need for high-level congressional intervention. The ideal vehicle would be an investigative committee of senior senators from both parties as well as members of the House. Some Senate Republicans are beginning to step up. Senator Richard Burr, chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, has already said his committee will investigate the election hacking. Chuck Grassley, chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, and Dianne Feinstein, the panels top-ranking Democrat, are asking for a briefing and transcripts of Mr. Flynns calls to the Russian ambassador. Senators John McCain, Lindsey Graham and Pat Roberts favor a broader investigation. John Cornyn, the Senate majority whip, has also raised the possibility of an investigation by Senate committees with jurisdiction over the intelligence community. The Democrats would obviously be on board  Chuck Schumer, the Senate Democratic leader, has also called for the Senate Intelligence Committee to lead a bipartisan inquiry. The person who needs to make this happen is Mitch McConnell, the Senate majority leader. Whatever form the committee takes, as Mr. Schumer said on Wednesday, all members must be granted equal access to intelligence officials, transcripts and documents that they need to answer critical questions, and they must be permitted to make their findings public to the maximum extent possible. Admittedly, this is hoping for a lot from a Republican leadership whose natural inclination is to protect the president. This week, for instance, congressional Republicans closed off one avenue to forcing the release of Mr. Trumps tax returns, which he has refused to divulge and which could help prove to Americans that he is not indebted to Russian financial entities. (It bears repeating, in this regard, that Mr. Trump didnt fire Mr. Flynn this week for chummily discussing American sanctions on Russia with Moscows ambassador, or for lying about it. Mr. Trump knew all that for weeks. He fired Mr. Flynn after both of them got caught.) With or without the administrations cooperation, Congresss plain and urgent duty, lest it be judged complicit, is to get to the bottom of this crisis.

The scientist, Ahmadreza Djalali, a physician who specializes in disaster medicine and has taught at universities in Belgium, Italy and Sweden, was arrested in April while driving to his familys house after arriving in Iran for a conference, an Italian newspaper has quoted his wife as saying. The wife, Vida Mehrannia, who lives in Stockholm with the couples two children, told the newspaper , Corriere della Sera, that her husband had been charged with the death penalty for collaboration with enemy states. Amnesty International  said in a statement last week that Dr. Djalali had been detained at Tehrans notorious Evin Prison since his arrest on April 25 and that he had been threatened with the death penalty.

His defense lawyer told Amnesty that the authorities had not yet issued an indictment or scheduled a trial.

Several Iranian prisoners who face political charges are currently refusing to eat in protest of their sentences. Dr. Djalali, 45, had been invited to attend workshops about disaster medicine at universities in Tehran and Shiraz, when he was arrested without a warrant by Ministry of Intelligence officials, Amnesty said. At Evin Prison, he was subjected to intense interrogations and was forced under great emotional and psychological pressure to sign statements, and he was not allowed visits from his lawyers.

The Italian government said in a statement that it had activated its channels of communication with the Iranian authorities to highlight its extreme concern. The Swedish Embassy in Tehran has asked for consular access to the researcher, but when the newspaper Expressen asked Prime Minister Stefan Lofven about the matter, he said that the embassy still had not gotten word about Dr. Djalali and pledged to bring up the issue with the Iranian government. Mr. Lofven has begun facing pressure from critics who say the Swedish government should tie Dr. Djalalis case to discussions over sanctions.

Holbrooke, who died in 2010 , took out a full-page ad in the newspaper Dagens Nyheter, demanding the cessation of business contacts between Swedish companies and the Iranian government. Belgiums foreign minister has also expressed his worries over Dr. Djalalis case. Caroline Pauwels, rector of the Vrije Universiteit Brussel, a university in Belgium where Dr. Djalali was teaching, said he had been doing important research . This scientist has been convicted without a public trial, and now faces the death penalty, she told the Belgian newspaper De Morgen. Dr. Djalalis colleagues learned of his arrest months after it happened because his wife had decided to remain silent, hoping he would be freed. Instead, she told them he had been involved in a car accident and was hospitalized, she told the Italian newspaper La Stampa . Iranian judicial authorities have remained silent. Iranian law does not recognize dual citizenship, and Dr. Djalali is not eligible for consular assistance from the Swedish Embassy in Tehran. Currently, Iran has imprisoned dozens of foreign citizens, among them six Americans and a Briton. Most of them are accused of spying.
