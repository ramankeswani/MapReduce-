Find out about the philosophy , curriculum and professional development opportunities offered by Visual Thinking Strategies. _________ Updated: March 23, 2017 This weeks image comes from a post on the Lively Morgue , a Times Tumblr that features images chosen from The Timess morgue, a physical library of photos and newspaper clippings dating to the mid-19th century. The original caption reads: March 1980: Please keep walking and react to the elephant, instructed the man with the megaphone who trailed the creature; apparently, it was for a film. But if this picture is any indication, it seems the window mannequins were more reactive than your average New Yorker, right, who just wanted to get where he was going. Bill Cunningham was the photographer. After working for nearly 40 years for The Times, he died in 2016. His obituary begins: Bill Cunningham, who turned fashion photography into his own branch of cultural anthropology on the streets of New York, chronicling an eras ever-changing social scene for The New York Times by training his busily observant lens on what people wore  stylishly, flamboyantly or just plain sensibly  died on Saturday in Manhattan. He was 87.  His death was confirmed by The Times. He had been hospitalized recently after having a stroke.  Mr. Cunningham was such a singular presence in the city that, in 2009, he was designated a living landmark. And he was an easy one to spot, riding his bicycle through Midtown, where he did most of his field work: his bony-thin frame draped in his utilitarian blue French workers jacket, khaki pants and black sneakers (he himself was no ones idea of a fashion plate), with his 35-millimeter camera slung around his neck, ever at the ready for the next fashion statement to come around the corner.  Nothing escaped his notice: not the fanny packs, not the Birkin bags, not the gingham shirts, not the fluorescent biker shorts.  In his nearly 40 years working for The Times, Mr. Cunningham snapped away at changing dress habits to chart the broader shift away from formality and toward something more diffuse and individualistic.

Freud, as we know, was exceptionally sensitive to the thought of growing old, and he delighted in this new coadjutor who had youth and to spare, being not only young in fact but young by his very name, and young (it seems clear) by virtue of his being Germanic and not Jewish. Jung, for his part, received from Freud the heady sense of having been chosen for a high destiny. A family legend had it that his grandfather, of the same name as himself, was an illegitimate son of Goethe, and it might be said that Freud licensed Jungs ambition to rival in fame this supposititious ancestor. _________   Think you know supposititious?

But the concrete-hard Good Samaritans, a production of Mr. Maxwells New York City Players, might be described as a concentrated, sugar-free version of the fluffy La La Land.  In both works, ostensibly ordinary people are allowed opportunities for self-expression normally reserved for the likes of Gene Kelly and Judy Garland.

Those who werent gonged were rated by the judges on a 1-to-10 scale. In keeping with the ridiculousness of the proceedings, the prize amount they vied for was ridiculous: $516.32 on the daytime version of the show, $712.05 on the prime-time edition.  The show, which ran on NBC until 1978 and then in syndication (with revivals in later years), became a cultural sensation. Critics complained about its crassness and cruelty, but Mr. Barris, like purveyors of burlesque and circus sideshows in earlier generations, knew there was a large audience for lowbrow. At one point the daytime version was attracting 78 percent of viewers 18 to 49. _________   Think you know burlesque?

On March 21, the Township Committee will vote on an ordinance to prohibit commercial use of blowers from May 15 through Sept. 30. The rule would expand a pilot program enacted last spring, increasing the fine for violations to $500 for a first offense and $1,000 for the second offense. Stricter limits would be set on the days and hours that professionals could use blowers the rest of the year. If it passes, Maplewood would join a growing number of communities that have curbed the use of leaf blowers. _________   Think you know ordinance?

For me the best Wyoming books are old journals and diaries by soldiers stationed at the various Wyoming forts, and photographs without text. _________ The Word of the Day and the quiz question have been provided by Vocabulary.com .

Nostalgia is a cheap crutch and a lame weapon. When the whole world is changing, though, disappearing and then re-emerging in different circumstances can be more deeply destabilizing. The things you held dear might be missing, or under attack. Adjusting is a full-time job.  Last week, the members of A Tribe Called Quest, one of the essential groups of the 1990s, came back after nearly two decades into a hip-hop world that had iterated a dozen or more times; they didnt flinch. And they returned in a moment when Americas racial tensions were at an outrageous level; they stepped into action. _________   Think you know grouse?
