One perk  or hazard, I suppose  of being a technology writer for the past few years has been getting invited to ride in a bunch of autonomous vehicles. Ive been shuttled around in nearly a dozen self-driving prototypes, including a Ford in Michigan, an Uber in Pennsylvania and a Chrysler minivan in the California desert. Whenever anyone asks what its like to ride in self-driving cars, my reply is: Which self-driving cars? Casual observers tend to talk about the progress of autonomous vehicles as if theyre a homogeneous category, but there is an entire spectrum of capability and safety. Ive had calm and boring drives, and terrifying white-knuckle trips. The best results arent always from the companies with the most money or the most sophisticated marketing campaigns. This week, the self-driving car industry reached a turning point, one at which the mixed progress of self-driving car projects became very clear.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   There was continued fallout from the fatal accident this month involving a self-driving Uber vehicle in Arizona, including a blockbuster story from my colleague Dai Wakabayashi about Ubers struggles to get its self-driving cars ready for the market. Since the crash, Arizona officials have ordered Uber to suspend its autonomous vehicle testing program in the state, and Uber is not renewing its permit to test self-driving cars in California . In addition, Lior Ron, an executive who led Uber Freight and was involved in the companys early self-driving efforts, is leaving the company .

(Sorry about the car puns  its an occupational hazard.) The company announced this week that over the next two years it would order up to 20,000 electric vehicles from Jaguar Land Rover for use in its consumer self-driving car service.  Continue reading the main story         Advertisement   Continue reading the main story       As my colleague Neal Boudette noted, Waymos announcement showed that the company has an audacious vision that goes far beyond even the most optimistic plans of its rivals. Waymo says that by 2020  that is, two years from now  its fleet of self-driving Jaguars will be doing as many as a million trips per day. Self-driving car companies are notorious for overhyping their progress. But the Waymo announcement, complete with specific timetables, cost projections and firm indicators of fleet size, is a really, really big deal. As Alexis Madrigal wrote in a piece for The Atlantic , if Waymo is within even 50 percent of a million daily rides in two years, the United States will have entered an entirely new phase in robotics and technology. Its unclear if Ubers tragic accident in Arizona will have a broader effect on the autonomous vehicle industry. There could be a regulatory backlash that would hamper all self-driving projects, regardless of progress. Manufacturers could decide to be extra cautious when it comes to rolling out their projects on public roads, in order to avoid a worst-case scenario. But if Waymos announcement is an indication of where the rest of the self-driving car industry is heading, we shouldnt expect too much of a slowdown. Autonomous vehicle manufacturers believe, with reason, that keeping their test vehicles on the road is a public health issue. The sooner they get safe self-driving cars to the masses, they say , the sooner we can avert some of the nearly 40,000 traffic deaths that happen in the United States every year.   That means, unfortunately, that more accidents are inevitable  and underscores the importance of creating a reliable standard to measure the technological progress of self-driving car projects. But it also means that the self-driving future could arrive, from Waymo or someone else, sooner than most people think.

Phoenix attorney Patrick McGroder said he has been retained by the mother, father and son of Elaine Herzberg, 49, who died after being struck by an Uber self-driving SUV while walking across a street in the suburb of Tempe earlier this month. On Thursday, a different law firm representing Herzberg's daughter and husband said it had reached a settlement with Uber. The terms were not given. That settlement does not affect the new case, McGroder said in an email on Friday. "We are in the initial stages of investigation," he said, noting he and his two partners will represent the family members and that they had sent a letter of representation to Uber this week.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   A spokesman for Uber declined to comment. The fallout from the accident could stall the development and testing of self-driving vehicles, designed to eventually perform far better than human drivers and to sharply reduce the number of motor vehicle fatalities that occur each year.  Continue reading the main story         Advertisement   Continue reading the main story       Uber has suspended its testing in the wake of the incident. Toyota Motor Corp and chipmaker Nvidia Corp have also suspended self-driving testing on public roads, as they and others await the results of investigations into the Tempe accident, believed to be the first death of a pedestrian struck by a self-driving vehicle.

Herzberg was pushing a bicycle while walking across a four-lane road outside a crosswalk when she was struck. Video footage from a dash-mounted camera inside the vehicle, released by Tempe police, showed the SUV traveling along a dark street when the headlights suddenly illuminated Herzberg in front of the SUV. Other footage showed that in the seconds before the accident, the human safety driver behind the wheel was mostly looking down, not at the road.

The companys technology is intended to help an autonomous vehicle handle unique situations that software programs cant anticipate.   Credit Christie Hemm Klok for The New York Times        A car wends its way through a line of taxis in the Las Vegas rain, carefully steering around a tangle of sedans vying for passengers. As the black Lincoln MKZ gets closer, the steering wheel saws back and forth, but theres no one in the front seat. In fact, theres no one in the car at all. Its disquieting to be picked up by an empty car, and its something of a milestone: Inside most autonomous research vehicles cruising public streets, theres a minder to keep a watchful eye and take control should things go awry. But with the MKZ, there was no human custodian. At least not one within view. Hundreds of miles away, Ben Shukman, a software engineer for Phantom Auto, was sitting in front of a phalanx of video screens in Mountain View, Calif. Using a live, two-way video connection along with the kind of steering wheel and pedals usually reserved for video games, he was driving the MKZ. While major technology and car companies are teaching cars to drive themselves, Phantom Auto is working on remote control systems, often referred to as teleoperation, that many see as a necessary safety feature for the autonomous cars of the future. And that future is closer than you might think: California will allow companies to test autonomous vehicles without a safety driver  as long as the car can be operated remotely  starting next month.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   While technologies ranging from advanced sensors to machine learning are being applied to self-driving cars, engineers acknowledge that even the most sophisticated vehicles will not be infallible. Developers of self-driving cars from Nissan to Zoox say such technology may be needed to address edge cases  the unique situations that software programs cant anticipate. A fallen tree, a sinkhole, a string of strange pylons, a flash flood, a fire or some other obstruction on a lonely road could make an autonomous car stop safely, but then what?  Photo        Phantom Autos technology provides a two-way video connection between the car and the remote driver.   Credit Christie Hemm Klok for The New York Times    What happens when a self-driving car cant help itself? We want to be the OnStar for the autonomous industry, said Shai Magzimof, a co-founder and the chief executive of Phantom Auto. He pictures the technology his company has developed being used in fleet vehicles, robotaxis, trucks and even self-driving cars owned by individuals.  Continue reading the main story         Advertisement   Continue reading the main story       A car in need of help would automatically contact a Phantom Auto center, where a remote operator could use the cars cameras and sensors to see what was happening, then maneuver the vehicle out of trouble. The technology prefigures a time when most passengers wouldnt be able to take control for the simple reason that they wont know how to drive a car  or because the steering wheel and pedals have been removed . It is a thorny problem other companies are also trying to solve. Nissan, one of the first automakers to publicly address situations in which a self-driving car may be flummoxed by its surroundings, has proposed using a system called Seamless Autonomous Mobility, or S.A.M. Its partly based on the remote control technology that NASA uses to operate rovers on Mars. The current idea is to draw the new route command onto a screen to direct the car, said Maarten Sierhuis, the director of Nissans research center in Silicon Valley. Such an approach avoids any possible communications glitches, and Mr. Sierhuis said the company was working on a more advanced solution, S.A.M. 2.0, but wasnt ready to discuss it yet.  Photo        We want to be the OnStar for the autonomous industry, said Shai Magzimof, the chief executive of Phantom Auto.   Credit Christie Hemm Klok for The New York Times    Waymo, the self-driving vehicle unit of Googles parent company Alphabet, is testing autonomous taxis  but with an observer in the back seat . It is focused on having the car make all the driving decisions, but there is a system for handling edge cases. If a Waymo vehicle becomes confused  by, say, a new set of cones or a police barricade in the road  it can request confirmation from a remote human specialist. Once it receives confirmation of what it is sensing, the car  not the remote operator  then decides how to proceed. The Waymo approach ensures that latency  a delay in the communications traffic  doesnt compromise the cars driving behavior by leaving a remote operator unable to react in real time.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   Phantom Autos technology, on the other hand, uses a standard 4G cellular data connection and GPS information to link the car and its backup driver. The company has even been able to make it work in areas that may have less than perfect service. To accomplish this, Phantom Auto mounted a computer the size of a hardcover book, spiked with antennas and four wireless modems, in the trunk. The car was outfitted with three video cameras, but no lidar or far infrared sensors. Its an arrangement that has already attracted several automotive customers, according to the company, although because of contractual obligations it could not yet disclose specific clients. Where a typical autonomous vehicle may drive like a timid student driver, the Phantom car behaved naturally  after all, there was a human there. He just happened to be sitting in another state.

The company has already attracted several automotive customers, although because of contractual obligations it could not yet disclose specific clients.   Credit Christie Hemm Klok for The New York Times    Phantom hopes its approach will also reassure passengers by letting them talk to and see the remote operator  within limits. As our distant driver steered the car through heavy traffic in the rain, Mr. Magzimof advised against distracting the operator with too many questions: Hes focused on driving. Gill Pratt, chief executive of the Toyota Research Institute, said that while he believed autonomous vehicles would need some sort of additional support and assistance systems in rare instances, he saw them as not something people would look forward to using. Mr. Pratt also pointed out that teleoperation faced several hurdles, ranging from the limited availability of wireless networks to the time it takes for remote operators to become situationally aware  informed not just of the immediate problem, but important context including the location or weather or any other variable that someone in the drivers seat would already know. Kathy Winter, the general manager of Intels autonomous driving group, said that because of these limitations, her team was making every effort to make sure the vehicle never gets into a situation where this would be necessary. She noted that redundant systems  including multiple sensors, high-resolution maps, crowdsourced data and vehicle-to-vehicle communications  would ensure that the self-driving cars of the future would have multiple cues about their surroundings. When pressed, developers like Zoox admit that autonomous vehicles may never be truly autonomous. Zooxs chief executive, Tim Kentley-Klay, acknowledged at a Senate hearing on self-driving cars in January that command centers with humans would be necessary both to deal with vehicles if they have an issue, but also to deal with customers if they need help. In other words, if your autonomous sedan gets a flat tire, someone is still going to have to come out and fix it.

Toyota temporarily halted its tests of self-driving vehicles on public roads after a crash involving an Uber autonomous car killed a pedestrian.   Credit David Paul Morris/Bloomberg     The fatal accident involving an autonomous vehicle operated by the ride-hailing service Uber has prompted one automaker to temporarily halt its testing of self-driving cars on public roads. The accident on Sunday night in Tempe, Ariz., prompted Uber to halt its tests on the streets of four cities: Tempe, Pittsburgh, San Francisco and Toronto. On Tuesday, Toyota Motor said that it, too, was suspending its tests of autonomous vehicles on public roads near its research center in Ann Arbor, Mich., and in the San Francisco area. Toyota has a fleet of test vehicles that can drive themselves, although engineers and safety drivers ride along to take control if necessary  the same arrangement that was used in the Uber vehicle that fatally struck a pedestrian in Tempe. Weve told our drivers to take a couple of days off so we can assess the situation, said Rick Bourgoise, a Toyota spokesman.

Continue reading the main story         Advertisement   Continue reading the main story       Two other carmakers, Ford Motor and General Motors, are still performing tests of their self-driving cars on public roads. Waymo, the autonomous vehicle division of Googles parent company Alphabet, and Lyft, Ubers chief rival in the ride-hailing sector, declined to comment on the status of their testing programs on Tuesday. Those companies are racing to put autonomous vehicles into commercial ride and delivery fleets within a few years. G.M. aims to start a ride-hailing service by the end of 2019 using a car it has developed, called the Cruise AV, that has no steering wheel or pedals. Ford hopes to have a similar vehicle in mass production by 2021 . After the Tempe accident, G.M. said Tuesday, our plans to commercially launch in dense urban environments in 2019 remain unchanged but, as weve said from the start, we will not launch until we are satisfied that it is safe to do so.     Graphic  How a Self-Driving Uber Killed a Pedestrian in Arizona  The death of a woman who was struck by an autonomous car operated by Uber is believed to be the first pedestrian fatality associated with self-driving technology. Newly released video offers clues about what happened.         OPEN Graphic      The accident in Tempe involved a Volvo XC90 sport-utility vehicle that Uber had outfitted with radar, cameras and other sensors and computer gear that enable it to navigate without input from a driver. Although a safety driver was in the vehicle at the time, it was in autonomous mode when it struck and killed Elaine Herzberg, 49, on Sunday night. Ms. Herzberg was walking with her bicycle when she was hit. The Volvo was traveling at about 40 miles per hour. The car did not appear to slow before the impact, according to the Tempe police. It is believed to be first pedestrian death associated with a self-driving car. The Tempe police said Tuesday that the investigation by the National Transportation Safety Board was still underway, including the gathering of electronic data from the car and video from a camera that was mounted on its dashboard. The police reiterated that it had not yet been determined whether any party was at fault.

One start-up has taken to a large retirement community  which is private property  to test, while some companies have also turned to virtual reality testing to teach their vehicles how to behave. At the same time, some universities and state and local governments have been working to create realistic proving grounds where companies can work on self-driving cars without interacting with the public.

It features simulated city streets and intersections, with traffic lights, road signs, parking meters, a railroad crossing and a tunnel. More than 60 companies have become partners in the project. We firmly believe a combination of on-road testing, enclosed facilities like MCity, and computer simulation will be required to develop autonomous technology, Ms. Morton said. The University of Michigan is also helping to develop a larger site about 10 miles away in Ypsilanti, where the American Center of Mobility covers 335 acres at a World War II-era bomber plant. It includes highway ramps, overpasses and bridges that allow automakers to test self-driving cars at high speeds and in more complex environments than at MCity. MCity and the American Center for Mobility are near technical centers operated by several companies, including G.M., Ford, Toyota, Fiat Chrysler, Hyundai and Waymo. GoMentum Stations is the largest such center, covering 2,100 acres. It has about 20 miles of paved roads and a cluster of barracks and buildings that provide an urban environment.

Lyft is working with Ford on a self-driving vehicle partnership. Credit Jeff Kowalsky/Agence France-Presse  Getty Images By  Mike Isaac Sept. 27, 2017 SAN FRANCISCO  For Lyft, winning the race to create the first fully self-driving vehicles on the road is a far from lonely pursuit. The companys ethos is the more partners, the merrier. That approach explains the new tie-up between Lyft and Ford Motor. On Wednesday, the companies said they had struck a partnership to develop and test autonomous vehicle designs and technology, with the aim of putting Fords self-driving vehicles on Lyfts ride-hailing network in the future. As part of the agreement, the companies plan to focus on issues such as software design, customer experience and user interfaces. Were focused on partnering with the auto industry because frankly, we think we cant do this alone and need each other to be successful, said Raj Kapoor, Lyfts chief strategy officer. Its one thing to do tests with one or two cars. Its a whole different world doing this on a large scale. The partnership represents another shift on the rapidly changing landscape for self-driving cars, where traditional automakers like General Motors and Silicon Valley companies including Waymo and Uber are all jockeying for the lead. Lyft has tried to position itself as an agnostic player in the autonomous vehicle industry with its Open Platform Initiative , under which it will cooperate with car manufacturers to test their self-driving cars and use their technology on its ride-hailing network. The self-driving start-up nuTonomy and Land Rover, among others, have already joined. At the same time, Lyft has also opened a new self-driving research facility in Palo Alto, Calif., and plans to recruit new engineering and autonomous vehicle researchers to develop its own autonomous vehicle technology. Lyft must be careful that it does not alienate any of the large group of partners it is trying to bring to the table. Allies like Waymo, one of Googles sister companies, which has agreed to work on self-driving technology with Lyft , could eventually become a competitor if Waymo ever decides to create its own ride-hailing network. Some tension has already become evident. Since Lyft began its partnership push, G.M., one of Lyfts biggest investors and partners, has started to test its own version of a ride-hailing network with some of its employees. G.M.s self-driving efforts are largely based on the technology developed by Cruise Automation , the start-up the automaker purchased last year for more than $1 billion. Ford, which is in the midst of a turnaround under a new chief executive, Jim Hackett, has also bet big on autonomous vehicles as part of its future. Ford pledged to invest $1 billion in Argo AI , a start-up that is developing machine learning and artificial intelligence for self-driving cars, over the next five years. For its part, Ford does not appear concerned with Lyfts growing web of partnerships. Some view the opportunity with self-driving vehicles as a race to be first, Sherif Marakby, who leads Fords autonomous vehicle efforts, said in a company blog post. We are focusing our efforts on building a service based around actual peoples needs and wants.

The companys chief executive, Tim Cook, at an event last year.   Credit Marcio Jose Sanchez/Associated Press     SAN FRANCISCO  As new employees were brought into Apples secret effort to create a self-driving car a few years ago, managers told them that they were working on the companys next big thing: A product that would take on Detroit and disrupt the automobile industry. These days, Apples automotive ambitions are more modest. The company has put off any notion of an Apple-branded autonomous vehicle and is instead working on the underlying technology that allows a car to drive itself. Timothy D. Cook, the companys chief executive, said in an interview with Bloomberg in June that Apple is focusing on autonomous systems. A notable symbol of that retrenchment is a self-driving shuttle service that ferries employees from one Apple building to another. The shuttle, which has never been reported before, will likely be a commercial vehicle from an automaker and Apple will use it to test the autonomous driving technology that it develops. Five people familiar with Apples car project, code-named Titan, discussed with The New York Times the missteps that led the tech giant to move  at least for now  from creating a self-driving Apple car to creating technology for a car that someone else builds. They spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to talk publicly about Apples plans.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   The projects reduced scale aligns Apple more closely with other tech companies that are working on autonomous driving technology but are steering clear of building cars. Even Waymo, the Google self-driving spinoff that is probably furthest along among Silicon Valley companies, has said repeatedly that it does not plan to produce its own vehicles.  Continue reading the main story         Advertisement   Continue reading the main story       Apples testing vehicles will carry employees between its various Silicon Valley offices. The new effort is called PAIL, short for Palo Alto to Infinite Loop, the address of the companys main office in Cupertino, Calif., and a few miles down the road from Palo Alto, Calif. Apples in-house shuttle service, which isnt operational yet, follows Waymo, Uber and a number of car companies that have been testing driverless cars on city streets around the world. Apple has a history of tinkering with a technology until its engineers figure out what to do with it. The company worked on touch screens for years, for example, before that technology became an essential part of the iPhone.  Photo        Apple will soon be moving into a new Silicon Valley headquarters.   Credit Justin Sullivan/Getty Images    But the initial scale of Apples driverless ambitions went beyond tinkering or building underlying technology. The Titan project started in 2014, and it was staffed by many Apple veterans. The company also hired engineers with expertise in building cars, and not just the software that would run an autonomous vehicle. It was a do-it-all approach typical of Apple, which prefers to control every aspect of a product, from the software that runs it to the look and feel of the hardware. From the beginning, the employees dedicated to Project Titan looked at a wide range of details. That included motorized doors that opened and closed silently. They also studied ways to redesign a car interior without a steering wheel or gas pedals, and they worked on adding virtual or augmented reality into interior displays. The team also worked on a new light and ranging detection sensor, also known as lidar. Lidar sensors normally protrude from the top of a car like a spinning cone and are essential in driverless cars. Apple, as always focused on clean designs, wanted to do away with the awkward cone.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   Apple even looked into reinventing the wheel. A team within Titan investigated the possibility of using spherical wheels  round like a globe  instead of the traditional, round ones, because spherical wheels could allow the car better lateral movement. But the car project ran into trouble, said the five people familiar with it, dogged by its size and by the lack of a clearly defined vision of what Apple wanted in a vehicle. Team members complained of shifting priorities and arbitrary or unrealistic deadlines.

Steve Zadesky, an Apple executive who was initially in charge of Titan, wanted to pursue the semiautonomous option. But people within the industrial design team including Jonathan Ive, Apples chief designer, believed that a fully driverless car would allow the company to reimagine the automobile experience, according to the five people. A similar debate raged inside Googles self-driving car effort for years. There, the fully autonomous vehicle won out, mainly because researchers worried drivers couldnt be trusted to retake control in an emergency.  Photo        Driverless cars are being tested on city streets throughout the country.   Credit Gene J. Puskar/Associated Press    Even though Apple had not ironed out many of the basics, like how the autonomous systems would work, a team had already started working on an operating system software called CarOS. There was fierce debate about whether it should be programmed using Swift, Apples own programming language, or the industry standard, C++. Mr. Zadesky, who worked on the iPod and iPhone, eventually left Titan and took a leave of absence from the company for personal reasons in 2016. He is still at Apple, although he is no longer involved in the project. Mr. Zadesky could not be reached for comment. Last year, Apple started to rein in the project . The company tapped Bob Mansfield, a longtime executive who over the years had led hardware engineering for some of Apples most successful products, to oversee Titan. Mr. Mansfield shelved plans to build a car and focused the project on the underlying self-driving technology. He also laid off some hardware staff, though the exact number of employees dedicated to working on car technology was unclear.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   More recently, the team has grown again, adding personnel with expertise in autonomous systems, rather than car production. Apples headlong foray into autonomous vehicles underscores one of the biggest challenges facing the company: finding the next breakthrough product. As Apple celebrates the iPhones 10th anniversary, the company remains heavily dependent on smartphone sales for growth. It has introduced new products like the Apple Watch and expanded revenue from services , but the iPhone still accounts for more than half of its sales. In April, the California Department of Motor Vehicles granted Apple a test permit to allow the company to test autonomous driving technology in three 2015 Lexus RX 450h sport utility vehicles. There will be a safety driver monitoring the car during testing. While many companies are pursuing driverless technology and see it as a game changer for car ownership and transportation, no one has figured out how to cash in yet. With expectations reset and the team more focused, people on the Titan project said morale has improved under Mr. Mansfield. Still, one of the biggest challenges is holding onto talented engineers because self-driving technology is one of the hottest things in Silicon Valley, and Apple is hardly the only company working on it.

Credit Jim Wilson/The New York Times     SAN FRANCISCO  Controlling the future of the smartphone was the defining technology battle of the last decade. Now, technology companies are betting that the next 10 years and beyond will be spent battling for control of the self-driving automobile. On Friday, Lyft, the ride-hailing company, announced that it was developing its own self-driving technology, marking yet another companys gamble that the future of transportation will be marked by self-driving cars. Lyft is marking the occasion with the opening of a new self-driving-research facility in Palo Alto, Calif., and plans to heavily recruit new engineering and technical people for the facility after it opens in the coming weeks. We arent thinking of our self-driving division as a side project. Its core to our business, said Luc Vincent, vice president of autonomous technology at Lyft. Thats why 10 percent of our engineers are already focused on developing self-driving technology  and well continue to grow that team in the months ahead.

And many other companies, from Alphabets Waymo unit in Silicon Valley to major auto manufacturers in Detroit and Europe, are also working on autonomous-driving technology.  Continue reading the main story         Advertisement   Continue reading the main story       Lyft is taking a markedly different approach from Uber. While Ubers self-driving plans have mostly been a solo effort, Lyft has announced what it calls its Open Platform Initiative , a way to develop autonomous vehicle technology in conjunction with automakers and technology companies. We want to bring the whole industry together with this, and we think theres a unique opportunity in time right now for Lyft to become a leader while doing it, said Raj Kapoor, Lyfts chief strategy officer, in a press event at the companys San Francisco headquarters. Perhaps the best way to understand the initiative is through the lens of the smartphone. Ubers approach is closer to that of Apple: Both companies want to control most of the product, whether the software or the hardware.

Both companies are creating software that many different hardware manufacturers can use, while developing the technology collaboratively with hardware partners. In Lyfts ideal world, that could mean a quicker spread of Lyfts technology among automakers. Automakers are scrambling to develop their own self-driving technology as they imagine how they might operate in a future in which fewer people own cars. Collaborating with Lyft could help bring that technology to market faster, while automakers could provide Lyfts ride-hailing network with more cars to serve riders. Lyft is seeing early signs of traction. Early partners include Waymo , nuTonomy, Jaguar, Land Rover and General Motors. The public details of the partnerships are scant, but all of the companies have committed to working together to make self-driving cars commonplace. There are potential drawbacks. Partners could decide to leave the Open Platform Initiative and develop their own software. Or companies could be wary of teaming up with Lyft because it is developing its own self-driving system.   Lyft executives believe that the self-driving-car race is in its early days, and that companies that may consider one another rivals still have much to gain from collaborating and learning while building the automobile fleets of the future. Lyft is not getting into the business of manufacturing a car, Mr. Kapoor said. Were on our way to creating a self-driving system. Then the auto industry can bring it to life.

Lidar may eventually help autonomous cars drive more safely.   Credit Ben Margot/Associated Press     SAN FRANCISCO  In the minds of many in Silicon Valley and in the auto industry, it is inevitable that cars will eventually drive themselves. It is simply a matter of how long it will take for the technology to be reliably safe. But as indicated by Googles challenges with the so-called handoff between machines and humans  not to mention Ubers problems during recent tests on the streets of San Francisco  there is a lot more work to be done before self-driving cars are ready for the mainstream. Here are some of the challenges facing technologists. The ability to respond to spoken commands or hand signals from law enforcement or highway safety employees. There are subtle signals that humans take for granted: the body language of a traffic control officer, for example, or a bicyclist trying to make eye contact. How do you teach a computer human intuition ? Perhaps the only way is endless hours of road testing, so that machines can learn the interactions that humans have been socialized to understand.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   Driving safely despite unclear lane markings. This, too, is a question of intuition. The most challenging driving environments require self-driving cars to make guidance decisions without white lines, Botts Dots (those little plastic bumps that mark lanes) or clear demarcations at the edge of the road.  Continue reading the main story         Advertisement   Continue reading the main story       Notably, California may phase out Botts Dots on its roads because, among other issues, they are not believed to be an effective lane-marking tool for automated vehicles. In short, the highway infrastructure is going to have to change over time to interact with computer-driven vehicles. Reliably recognizing traffic lights that are not working. Picking out traffic lights is now done reliably by self-driving car vision systems. Making correct decisions in the event of a power failure is more challenging. Yet again, its a question of teaching a machine human intuition and how to cooperate among multiple vehicles.

Merging into rapidly flowing lanes of traffic is a delicate task that often requires eye contact with oncoming drivers. How can machines subtly let other machines and humans know what they are trying to do? Researchers are considering solutions like electronic signs and car-to-car communications systems. Detecting which small objects in the roadway must be avoided. Recognizing objects is something that machine-vision systems can now do reliably. But so-called scene understanding, which would inform a determination like whether a bag on the road is empty or hides a brick inside, is more challenging for computer vision systems. The ability to operate safely in all weather conditions. Software improvements to lidar (short for light detection and ranging) technology may help someday, but not yet. Lidar systems cant be fooled by darkness or sun glare. But if youre wondering whether the lidar systems in self-driving cars have problems in rain or snow, youre on to something. Heavy rain or snow can confuse current car radar and lidar systems, making it necessary for humans to intervene.  Cybersecurity . There is no evidence yet that autonomous cars will be any more secure than any other networked computers. A self-driving car is a collection of networked computers and sensors wirelessly connected to the outside world. Keeping the systems safe from intruders who may wish to crash cars  or turn them into weapons  may be the most daunting challenge facing autonomous driving.

Barra, the chief executive of General Motors, is seeking to expand and accelerate the companys development of self-driving cars.   Credit Paul Sancya/Associated Press     In the race to develop self-driving cars, General Motors is expanding its operations near Silicon Valley. The automaker said on Thursday that it planned to hire 1,100 people and invest $14 million at a new development center in San Francisco that would spearhead the companys work on self-driving cars. G.M. and Cruise Automation, an autonomous-driving software company G.M. acquired a year ago, have been testing more than 50 Chevrolet Bolt electric cars equipped with self-driving technology on public roads in San Francisco; Scottsdale, Ariz.; and the Detroit area. The new investment and hiring are intended to expand and accelerate their work, G.M.s chief executive, Mary T. Barra, said in a statement.

Continue reading the main story         Advertisement   Continue reading the main story       The move comes as traditional automakers are rushing to partner with and acquire technology companies amid a global race to develop cars capable of driving themselves safely with little input from passengers. In February , Ford Motor said it planned to invest $1 billion over the next five years in Argo AI, an artificial intelligence company, as part of its own push to develop self-driving cars. Ford has also vowed to begin production of a fully automated car  with no steering wheel and no pedals  by 2021. Similar efforts are underway at Audi, BMW and other car companies. The automotive giants are competing with technology companies that appear to be leading the self-driving race. Googles automated car subsidiary, Waymo, has racked up more than 200 million miles of driving with various test vehicles, while Tesla already offers its semi-automated Autopilot system in its electric vehicles.

Traditional automakers from Detroit and around the world are responding by trying to build a greater presence in the Silicon Valley region, to compete for both technology and engineering talent. G.M. plans to introduce a system called SuperCruise as an option in certain Cadillac models, possibly by the end of this year. SuperCruise is supposed to be capable of piloting a car on limited-access highways, although it will require drivers to keep their eyes on the road. SuperCruise is not based on technology developed by Cruise Automation. G.M. acquired Cruise for a reported $1 billion. G.M.s investment will upgrade an existing location in San Francisco that will more than double Cruise Automations research and development space. As autonomous car technology matures, our companys talent needs will continue to increase, said Kyle Vogt, Cruise Automations chief executive. Accessing the world-class talent pool that the San Francisco Bay Area offers is one of the many reasons we plan to grow our presence in the state.   Correction: April 21, 2017   An article last Friday about General Motors plans to expand its self-driving car operations in Silicon Valley referred incorrectly to SuperCruise technology, which G.M. plans to offer as an option in certain models and is supposed to be capable of piloting a car on limited-access highways. It is separate from technology developed by Cruise Automation, an autonomous-driving software company G.M. acquired; Cruise Automation is not part of the basis of the SuperCruise technology.

Credit Ford     How do you create a map showing every road in the United States, with the precise location of every stop sign, all the lane markings, every exit ramp and every traffic light  and update it in real time as traffic is rerouted around construction and accidents? Thats a challenge that automakers and technology companies are confronting in their race to develop self-driving cars, the kind that someday will let you sit back and read or watch TV on the way to work each morning. The need for highly detailed, three-dimensional, computerized maps  which pinpoint a cars location and understand its surroundings  is often overlooked amid all the hype about autonomous vehicles. The chatter tends to focus more on the various sensors that enable cars to see the road and any obstacles in front of them. Those sensors include radar, cameras and a laser-based kind of radar known as lidar. But digital maps are an equally critical piece of the puzzle. If we want to have autonomous cars everywhere, we have to have digital maps everywhere, said Amnon Shashua, chief technology officer at Mobileye , an Israeli company that makes advanced vision systems for automobiles.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   Creating them, however, is a monumental task. There are more than four million miles of roads in the United States. And compared with the maps used by GPS and navigation systems, the level of precision must be much greater. Navigational maps typically locate a cars position within several yards. Digital maps for autonomous cars must know the locations of cars, curbs and other objects within about four inches.  Continue reading the main story         Advertisement   Continue reading the main story       So far the drive to create digital maps has been slow. Googles former self-driving car division  now a company called Waymo  has created maps for roads around its headquarters in Mountain View, Calif., and a handful of other cities, including Austin, Tex., and Kirkland, Wash. Waymo creates the maps by driving around cars equipped with spinning lidar units mounted on their roofs that shoot out laser beams, creating images of the road and the surroundings. Human engineers, in a time-consuming process, then go over the images and tag the objects that are found, like stop signs, buildings, stoplights and do-not-enter signs. The laser equipment needed to do this scanning is expensive  it can cost $100,000 or more to outfit just one car to do this job.            5 Things That Give Self-Driving Cars Headaches    Another company, Here , which was started by Nokia and then acquired by the German automakers BMW, Daimler and Audi, is also mapping roads in the United States and Europe. It is drawing on data scooped up by scanning systems that trucking companies have agreed to install on their vehicles. Here also has its own fleet of cars collecting images, and is working on algorithms to enable computers to annotate the maps. The effort may soon shift into higher gear, thanks to an idea borrowed from the internet that has helped in other fields: crowdsourcing. Mobileye supplies front-facing camera systems that enable cars to detect obstacles and brake to prevent or mitigate collisions. Starting with 2018 models, both Volkswagen and BMW will outfit their vehicles with Mobileye systems that can also transmit their precise locations and images of the roads they are traveling, which can be synthesized into one giant digital map. Mr. Shashua said his company expected to sign on many other automakers to do the same. You can leverage the fact that you will have millions of cars with cameras  almost all the new cars that hit the road, he said. This is a force multiplier. Others are thinking along the same lines. A technology start-up called Civil Maps is trying to develop its own image-vacuuming device and hopes to persuade automakers to install it in cars and trucks. The company is also working on artificial intelligence technology that it hopes will automate the annotating of maps  the other big technological challenge. Its work has attracted an investment from Ford Motor.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   For full autonomy, we believe we need to have a high-definition map of the area weve been operating in, a map annotated with what are the permanent fixed objects in that area, said Raj Nair, the global product development chief at Ford, which has vowed to begin producing a fully autonomous car  with no steering wheel and no pedals  by 2021. Mobileye envisions assembling its data into a giant map called Road Book, and plans to share it with Here. The idea is that Here at some point will license the mapping information for use by self-driving cars and Mobileye will get a share of that, Mr. Shashua said. Some of the money will go back to automakers like VW and BMW that add the mapping capability to their cars. There is a revenue-sharing model between us and the carmakers, he said, noting that map services are a future business. Consumers would be paying for map services for their autonomous cars.  Photo        In an image from the Ford digital map of Mcity, colors denote objects like road signs and a fence that were detected by a laser-based sensing system.   Credit Ford    The reason digital maps are so important is that even the most advanced sensors, like radar and cameras, are not enough to enable a car to navigate a chaotic and changing world safely enough to allow occupants to lean back and take a snooze. Digital maps ease the burden by helping give foresight to a cars computers, and adding redundancy to the cars understanding of the situation it faces, said Civil Maps chief executive, Sravan Puttagunta. Radar and cameras cannot always recognize a stop sign if pedestrians are standing in the way or the sign has been knocked down, he explained. But if the map knows there is a stop sign ahead, then the sensors just need to confirm it, Mr. Puttagunta said. Then the load on the sensors and processor is much lower. The need for data that can complement radar and camera readings was made clear last year when an Ohio man, Joshua Brown, died in a crash in Florida when his 2015 Tesla Model S was operating under control of the electric car s Autopilot system. As the car was traveling on a state highway at 74 miles per hour, a white tractor-trailer was crossing the road, but Autopilots sensors had trouble recognizing it against a bright sky. Tesla has said Autopilot may have thought the truck was an overpass.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   A digital map could have shown that there was no overpass in that location and that an obstacle was blocking the road. As it was, neither the car nor Mr. Brown hit the brakes. An investigation of the crash by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration found no safety defect in Teslas Autopilot technology. It added, however, that Tesla needed to be cautious in its marketing and advertising not to overstate the capabilities of Autopilot, a semiautonomous system that requires drivers to keep their eyes on the road and hands on the steering wheel. Last fall, Tesla updated Autopilot, and one upgrade is a basic use of digital mapping. Cars that have the new software, known as Version 8, note the positions of road signs, bridges and other objects, and send the data to a Tesla database that other Tesla vehicles can draw on to make safe driving decisions. Tesla calls this fleet learning.   A version of this article appears in print on March 3, 2017, on Page B1 of the New York edition with the headline: Creating a Road Map for the Self-Driving Car.

One perk  or hazard, I suppose  of being a technology writer for the past few years has been getting invited to ride in a bunch of autonomous vehicles. Ive been shuttled around in nearly a dozen self-driving prototypes, including a Ford in Michigan, an Uber in Pennsylvania and a Chrysler minivan in the California desert. Whenever anyone asks what its like to ride in self-driving cars, my reply is: Which self-driving cars? Casual observers tend to talk about the progress of autonomous vehicles as if theyre a homogeneous category, but there is an entire spectrum of capability and safety. Ive had calm and boring drives, and terrifying white-knuckle trips. The best results arent always from the companies with the most money or the most sophisticated marketing campaigns. This week, the self-driving car industry reached a turning point, one at which the mixed progress of self-driving car projects became very clear.

Since the crash, Arizona officials have ordered Uber to suspend its autonomous vehicle testing program in the state, and Uber is not renewing its permit to test self-driving cars in California . In addition, Lior Ron, an executive who led Uber Freight and was involved in the companys early self-driving efforts, is leaving the company .

(Sorry about the car puns  its an occupational hazard.) The company announced this week that over the next two years it would order up to 20,000 electric vehicles from Jaguar Land Rover for use in its consumer self-driving car service.  Continue reading the main story         Advertisement   Continue reading the main story       As my colleague Neal Boudette noted, Waymos announcement showed that the company has an audacious vision that goes far beyond even the most optimistic plans of its rivals. Waymo says that by 2020  that is, two years from now  its fleet of self-driving Jaguars will be doing as many as a million trips per day. Self-driving car companies are notorious for overhyping their progress. But the Waymo announcement, complete with specific timetables, cost projections and firm indicators of fleet size, is a really, really big deal. As Alexis Madrigal wrote in a piece for The Atlantic , if Waymo is within even 50 percent of a million daily rides in two years, the United States will have entered an entirely new phase in robotics and technology. Its unclear if Ubers tragic accident in Arizona will have a broader effect on the autonomous vehicle industry. There could be a regulatory backlash that would hamper all self-driving projects, regardless of progress. Manufacturers could decide to be extra cautious when it comes to rolling out their projects on public roads, in order to avoid a worst-case scenario. But if Waymos announcement is an indication of where the rest of the self-driving car industry is heading, we shouldnt expect too much of a slowdown. Autonomous vehicle manufacturers believe, with reason, that keeping their test vehicles on the road is a public health issue. The sooner they get safe self-driving cars to the masses, they say , the sooner we can avert some of the nearly 40,000 traffic deaths that happen in the United States every year.   That means, unfortunately, that more accidents are inevitable  and underscores the importance of creating a reliable standard to measure the technological progress of self-driving car projects. But it also means that the self-driving future could arrive, from Waymo or someone else, sooner than most people think.

Phoenix attorney Patrick McGroder said he has been retained by the mother, father and son of Elaine Herzberg, 49, who died after being struck by an Uber self-driving SUV while walking across a street in the suburb of Tempe earlier this month. On Thursday, a different law firm representing Herzberg's daughter and husband said it had reached a settlement with Uber. The terms were not given. That settlement does not affect the new case, McGroder said in an email on Friday. "We are in the initial stages of investigation," he said, noting he and his two partners will represent the family members and that they had sent a letter of representation to Uber this week.

Herzberg was pushing a bicycle while walking across a four-lane road outside a crosswalk when she was struck. Video footage from a dash-mounted camera inside the vehicle, released by Tempe police, showed the SUV traveling along a dark street when the headlights suddenly illuminated Herzberg in front of the SUV. Other footage showed that in the seconds before the accident, the human safety driver behind the wheel was mostly looking down, not at the road.

The companys technology is intended to help an autonomous vehicle handle unique situations that software programs cant anticipate. Credit Christie Hemm Klok for The New York Times By  John R. Quain March 15, 2018 A car wends its way through a line of taxis in the Las Vegas rain, carefully steering around a tangle of sedans vying for passengers. As the black Lincoln MKZ gets closer, the steering wheel saws back and forth, but theres no one in the front seat. In fact, theres no one in the car at all. Its disquieting to be picked up by an empty car, and its something of a milestone: Inside most autonomous research vehicles cruising public streets, theres a minder to keep a watchful eye and take control should things go awry. But with the MKZ, there was no human custodian. At least not one within view. Hundreds of miles away, Ben Shukman, a software engineer for Phantom Auto, was sitting in front of a phalanx of video screens in Mountain View, Calif. Using a live, two-way video connection along with the kind of steering wheel and pedals usually reserved for video games, he was driving the MKZ. While major technology and car companies are teaching cars to drive themselves, Phantom Auto is working on remote control systems, often referred to as teleoperation, that many see as a necessary safety feature for the autonomous cars of the future. And that future is closer than you might think: California will allow companies to test autonomous vehicles without a safety driver  as long as the car can be operated remotely  starting next month. While technologies ranging from advanced sensors to machine learning are being applied to self-driving cars, engineers acknowledge that even the most sophisticated vehicles will not be infallible. Developers of self-driving cars from Nissan to Zoox say such technology may be needed to address edge cases  the unique situations that software programs cant anticipate. A fallen tree, a sinkhole, a string of strange pylons, a flash flood, a fire or some other obstruction on a lonely road could make an autonomous car stop safely, but then what? Image Phantom Autos technology provides a two-way video connection between the car and the remote driver. Credit Christie Hemm Klok for The New York Times What happens when a self-driving car cant help itself? We want to be the OnStar for the autonomous industry, said Shai Magzimof, a co-founder and the chief executive of Phantom Auto. He pictures the technology his company has developed being used in fleet vehicles, robotaxis, trucks and even self-driving cars owned by individuals. A car in need of help would automatically contact a Phantom Auto center, where a remote operator could use the cars cameras and sensors to see what was happening, then maneuver the vehicle out of trouble. The technology prefigures a time when most passengers wouldnt be able to take control for the simple reason that they wont know how to drive a car  or because the steering wheel and pedals have been removed . It is a thorny problem other companies are also trying to solve. Nissan, one of the first automakers to publicly address situations in which a self-driving car may be flummoxed by its surroundings, has proposed using a system called Seamless Autonomous Mobility, or S.A.M. Its partly based on the remote control technology that NASA uses to operate rovers on Mars. The current idea is to draw the new route command onto a screen to direct the car, said Maarten Sierhuis, the director of Nissans research center in Silicon Valley. Such an approach avoids any possible communications glitches, and Mr. Sierhuis said the company was working on a more advanced solution, S.A.M. 2.0, but wasnt ready to discuss it yet. Image We want to be the OnStar for the autonomous industry, said Shai Magzimof, the chief executive of Phantom Auto. Credit Christie Hemm Klok for The New York Times Waymo, the self-driving vehicle unit of Googles parent company Alphabet, is testing autonomous taxis  but with an observer in the back seat . It is focused on having the car make all the driving decisions, but there is a system for handling edge cases. If a Waymo vehicle becomes confused  by, say, a new set of cones or a police barricade in the road  it can request confirmation from a remote human specialist. Once it receives confirmation of what it is sensing, the car  not the remote operator  then decides how to proceed. The Waymo approach ensures that latency  a delay in the communications traffic  doesnt compromise the cars driving behavior by leaving a remote operator unable to react in real time. Phantom Autos technology, on the other hand, uses a standard 4G cellular data connection and GPS information to link the car and its backup driver. The company has even been able to make it work in areas that may have less than perfect service. To accomplish this, Phantom Auto mounted a computer the size of a hardcover book, spiked with antennas and four wireless modems, in the trunk. The car was outfitted with three video cameras, but no lidar or far infrared sensors. Its an arrangement that has already attracted several automotive customers, according to the company, although because of contractual obligations it could not yet disclose specific clients. Where a typical autonomous vehicle may drive like a timid student driver, the Phantom car behaved naturally  after all, there was a human there. He just happened to be sitting in another state. Image The control room at Phantom Auto. The company has already attracted several automotive customers, although because of contractual obligations it could not yet disclose specific clients. Credit Christie Hemm Klok for The New York Times Phantom hopes its approach will also reassure passengers by letting them talk to and see the remote operator  within limits. As our distant driver steered the car through heavy traffic in the rain, Mr. Magzimof advised against distracting the operator with too many questions: Hes focused on driving. Gill Pratt, chief executive of the Toyota Research Institute, said that while he believed autonomous vehicles would need some sort of additional support and assistance systems in rare instances, he saw them as not something people would look forward to using. Mr. Pratt also pointed out that teleoperation faced several hurdles, ranging from the limited availability of wireless networks to the time it takes for remote operators to become situationally aware  informed not just of the immediate problem, but important context including the location or weather or any other variable that someone in the drivers seat would already know. Kathy Winter, the general manager of Intels autonomous driving group, said that because of these limitations, her team was making every effort to make sure the vehicle never gets into a situation where this would be necessary. She noted that redundant systems  including multiple sensors, high-resolution maps, crowdsourced data and vehicle-to-vehicle communications  would ensure that the self-driving cars of the future would have multiple cues about their surroundings. When pressed, developers like Zoox admit that autonomous vehicles may never be truly autonomous. Zooxs chief executive, Tim Kentley-Klay, acknowledged at a Senate hearing on self-driving cars in January that command centers with humans would be necessary both to deal with vehicles if they have an issue, but also to deal with customers if they need help. In other words, if your autonomous sedan gets a flat tire, someone is still going to have to come out and fix it.

Toyota temporarily halted its tests of self-driving vehicles on public roads after a crash involving an Uber autonomous car killed a pedestrian.   Credit David Paul Morris/Bloomberg     The fatal accident involving an autonomous vehicle operated by the ride-hailing service Uber has prompted one automaker to temporarily halt its testing of self-driving cars on public roads. The accident on Sunday night in Tempe, Ariz., prompted Uber to halt its tests on the streets of four cities: Tempe, Pittsburgh, San Francisco and Toronto. On Tuesday, Toyota Motor said that it, too, was suspending its tests of autonomous vehicles on public roads near its research center in Ann Arbor, Mich., and in the San Francisco area. Toyota has a fleet of test vehicles that can drive themselves, although engineers and safety drivers ride along to take control if necessary  the same arrangement that was used in the Uber vehicle that fatally struck a pedestrian in Tempe. Weve told our drivers to take a couple of days off so we can assess the situation, said Rick Bourgoise, a Toyota spokesman.

Waymo, the autonomous vehicle division of Googles parent company Alphabet, and Lyft, Ubers chief rival in the ride-hailing sector, declined to comment on the status of their testing programs on Tuesday. Those companies are racing to put autonomous vehicles into commercial ride and delivery fleets within a few years. G.M. aims to start a ride-hailing service by the end of 2019 using a car it has developed, called the Cruise AV, that has no steering wheel or pedals. Ford hopes to have a similar vehicle in mass production by 2021 . After the Tempe accident, G.M. said Tuesday, our plans to commercially launch in dense urban environments in 2019 remain unchanged but, as weve said from the start, we will not launch until we are satisfied that it is safe to do so.     Graphic  How a Self-Driving Uber Killed a Pedestrian in Arizona  The death of a woman who was struck by an autonomous car operated by Uber is believed to be the first pedestrian fatality associated with self-driving technology. Newly released video offers clues about what happened.         OPEN Graphic      The accident in Tempe involved a Volvo XC90 sport-utility vehicle that Uber had outfitted with radar, cameras and other sensors and computer gear that enable it to navigate without input from a driver. Although a safety driver was in the vehicle at the time, it was in autonomous mode when it struck and killed Elaine Herzberg, 49, on Sunday night. Ms. Herzberg was walking with her bicycle when she was hit. The Volvo was traveling at about 40 miles per hour. The car did not appear to slow before the impact, according to the Tempe police. It is believed to be first pedestrian death associated with a self-driving car. The Tempe police said Tuesday that the investigation by the National Transportation Safety Board was still underway, including the gathering of electronic data from the car and video from a camera that was mounted on its dashboard. The police reiterated that it had not yet been determined whether any party was at fault.

One start-up has taken to a large retirement community  which is private property  to test, while some companies have also turned to virtual reality testing to teach their vehicles how to behave. At the same time, some universities and state and local governments have been working to create realistic proving grounds where companies can work on self-driving cars without interacting with the public.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   Obviously this is a real tragedy, and it will take time to know what happened, said Carrie Morton, deputy director of MCity, a 32-acre center operated in Ann Arbor by the University of Michigan. It features simulated city streets and intersections, with traffic lights, road signs, parking meters, a railroad crossing and a tunnel. More than 60 companies have become partners in the project. We firmly believe a combination of on-road testing, enclosed facilities like MCity, and computer simulation will be required to develop autonomous technology, Ms. Morton said. The University of Michigan is also helping to develop a larger site about 10 miles away in Ypsilanti, where the American Center of Mobility covers 335 acres at a World War II-era bomber plant. It includes highway ramps, overpasses and bridges that allow automakers to test self-driving cars at high speeds and in more complex environments than at MCity. MCity and the American Center for Mobility are near technical centers operated by several companies, including G.M., Ford, Toyota, Fiat Chrysler, Hyundai and Waymo. GoMentum Stations is the largest such center, covering 2,100 acres. It has about 20 miles of paved roads and a cluster of barracks and buildings that provide an urban environment.

Credit Jeff Kowalsky/Agence France-Presse  Getty Images     SAN FRANCISCO  For Lyft, winning the race to create the first fully self-driving vehicles on the road is a far from lonely pursuit. The companys ethos is the more partners, the merrier. That approach explains the new tie-up between Lyft and Ford Motor. On Wednesday, the companies said they had struck a partnership to develop and test autonomous vehicle designs and technology, with the aim of putting Fords self-driving vehicles on Lyfts ride-hailing network in the future. As part of the agreement, the companies plan to focus on issues such as software design, customer experience and user interfaces. Were focused on partnering with the auto industry because frankly, we think we cant do this alone and need each other to be successful, said Raj Kapoor, Lyfts chief strategy officer. Its one thing to do tests with one or two cars. Its a whole different world doing this on a large scale. The partnership represents another shift on the rapidly changing landscape for self-driving cars, where traditional automakers like General Motors and Silicon Valley companies including Waymo and Uber are all jockeying for the lead.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   Lyft has tried to position itself as an agnostic player in the autonomous vehicle industry with its Open Platform Initiative , under which it will cooperate with car manufacturers to test their self-driving cars and use their technology on its ride-hailing network. The self-driving start-up nuTonomy and Land Rover, among others, have already joined.  Continue reading the main story         Advertisement   Continue reading the main story       At the same time, Lyft has also opened a new self-driving research facility in Palo Alto, Calif., and plans to recruit new engineering and autonomous vehicle researchers to develop its own autonomous vehicle technology.

Allies like Waymo, one of Googles sister companies, which has agreed to work on self-driving technology with Lyft , could eventually become a competitor if Waymo ever decides to create its own ride-hailing network. Some tension has already become evident. Since Lyft began its partnership push, G.M., one of Lyfts biggest investors and partners, has started to test its own version of a ride-hailing network with some of its employees. G.M.s self-driving efforts are largely based on the technology developed by Cruise Automation , the start-up the automaker purchased last year for more than $1 billion. Ford, which is in the midst of a turnaround under a new chief executive, Jim Hackett, has also bet big on autonomous vehicles as part of its future. Ford pledged to invest $1 billion in Argo AI , a start-up that is developing machine learning and artificial intelligence for self-driving cars, over the next five years. For its part, Ford does not appear concerned with Lyfts growing web of partnerships. Some view the opportunity with self-driving vehicles as a race to be first, Sherif Marakby, who leads Fords autonomous vehicle efforts, said in a company blog post. We are focusing our efforts on building a service based around actual peoples needs and wants.

The companys chief executive, Tim Cook, at an event last year.   Credit Marcio Jose Sanchez/Associated Press     SAN FRANCISCO  As new employees were brought into Apples secret effort to create a self-driving car a few years ago, managers told them that they were working on the companys next big thing: A product that would take on Detroit and disrupt the automobile industry. These days, Apples automotive ambitions are more modest. The company has put off any notion of an Apple-branded autonomous vehicle and is instead working on the underlying technology that allows a car to drive itself. Timothy D. Cook, the companys chief executive, said in an interview with Bloomberg in June that Apple is focusing on autonomous systems. A notable symbol of that retrenchment is a self-driving shuttle service that ferries employees from one Apple building to another. The shuttle, which has never been reported before, will likely be a commercial vehicle from an automaker and Apple will use it to test the autonomous driving technology that it develops. Five people familiar with Apples car project, code-named Titan, discussed with The New York Times the missteps that led the tech giant to move  at least for now  from creating a self-driving Apple car to creating technology for a car that someone else builds. They spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to talk publicly about Apples plans.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   The projects reduced scale aligns Apple more closely with other tech companies that are working on autonomous driving technology but are steering clear of building cars. Even Waymo, the Google self-driving spinoff that is probably furthest along among Silicon Valley companies, has said repeatedly that it does not plan to produce its own vehicles.  Continue reading the main story         Advertisement   Continue reading the main story       Apples testing vehicles will carry employees between its various Silicon Valley offices. The new effort is called PAIL, short for Palo Alto to Infinite Loop, the address of the companys main office in Cupertino, Calif., and a few miles down the road from Palo Alto, Calif. Apples in-house shuttle service, which isnt operational yet, follows Waymo, Uber and a number of car companies that have been testing driverless cars on city streets around the world. Apple has a history of tinkering with a technology until its engineers figure out what to do with it. The company worked on touch screens for years, for example, before that technology became an essential part of the iPhone.  Photo        Apple will soon be moving into a new Silicon Valley headquarters.   Credit Justin Sullivan/Getty Images    But the initial scale of Apples driverless ambitions went beyond tinkering or building underlying technology. The Titan project started in 2014, and it was staffed by many Apple veterans. The company also hired engineers with expertise in building cars, and not just the software that would run an autonomous vehicle. It was a do-it-all approach typical of Apple, which prefers to control every aspect of a product, from the software that runs it to the look and feel of the hardware. From the beginning, the employees dedicated to Project Titan looked at a wide range of details. That included motorized doors that opened and closed silently. They also studied ways to redesign a car interior without a steering wheel or gas pedals, and they worked on adding virtual or augmented reality into interior displays. The team also worked on a new light and ranging detection sensor, also known as lidar. Lidar sensors normally protrude from the top of a car like a spinning cone and are essential in driverless cars. Apple, as always focused on clean designs, wanted to do away with the awkward cone.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   Apple even looked into reinventing the wheel. A team within Titan investigated the possibility of using spherical wheels  round like a globe  instead of the traditional, round ones, because spherical wheels could allow the car better lateral movement. But the car project ran into trouble, said the five people familiar with it, dogged by its size and by the lack of a clearly defined vision of what Apple wanted in a vehicle. Team members complained of shifting priorities and arbitrary or unrealistic deadlines.

Steve Zadesky, an Apple executive who was initially in charge of Titan, wanted to pursue the semiautonomous option. But people within the industrial design team including Jonathan Ive, Apples chief designer, believed that a fully driverless car would allow the company to reimagine the automobile experience, according to the five people. A similar debate raged inside Googles self-driving car effort for years. There, the fully autonomous vehicle won out, mainly because researchers worried drivers couldnt be trusted to retake control in an emergency.  Photo        Driverless cars are being tested on city streets throughout the country.   Credit Gene J. Puskar/Associated Press    Even though Apple had not ironed out many of the basics, like how the autonomous systems would work, a team had already started working on an operating system software called CarOS. There was fierce debate about whether it should be programmed using Swift, Apples own programming language, or the industry standard, C++. Mr. Zadesky, who worked on the iPod and iPhone, eventually left Titan and took a leave of absence from the company for personal reasons in 2016. He is still at Apple, although he is no longer involved in the project. Mr. Zadesky could not be reached for comment. Last year, Apple started to rein in the project . The company tapped Bob Mansfield, a longtime executive who over the years had led hardware engineering for some of Apples most successful products, to oversee Titan. Mr. Mansfield shelved plans to build a car and focused the project on the underlying self-driving technology. He also laid off some hardware staff, though the exact number of employees dedicated to working on car technology was unclear.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   More recently, the team has grown again, adding personnel with expertise in autonomous systems, rather than car production. Apples headlong foray into autonomous vehicles underscores one of the biggest challenges facing the company: finding the next breakthrough product. As Apple celebrates the iPhones 10th anniversary, the company remains heavily dependent on smartphone sales for growth. It has introduced new products like the Apple Watch and expanded revenue from services , but the iPhone still accounts for more than half of its sales. In April, the California Department of Motor Vehicles granted Apple a test permit to allow the company to test autonomous driving technology in three 2015 Lexus RX 450h sport utility vehicles. There will be a safety driver monitoring the car during testing. While many companies are pursuing driverless technology and see it as a game changer for car ownership and transportation, no one has figured out how to cash in yet. With expectations reset and the team more focused, people on the Titan project said morale has improved under Mr. Mansfield. Still, one of the biggest challenges is holding onto talented engineers because self-driving technology is one of the hottest things in Silicon Valley, and Apple is hardly the only company working on it.

Credit Jim Wilson/The New York Times     SAN FRANCISCO  Controlling the future of the smartphone was the defining technology battle of the last decade. Now, technology companies are betting that the next 10 years and beyond will be spent battling for control of the self-driving automobile. On Friday, Lyft, the ride-hailing company, announced that it was developing its own self-driving technology, marking yet another companys gamble that the future of transportation will be marked by self-driving cars. Lyft is marking the occasion with the opening of a new self-driving-research facility in Palo Alto, Calif., and plans to heavily recruit new engineering and technical people for the facility after it opens in the coming weeks. We arent thinking of our self-driving division as a side project. Its core to our business, said Luc Vincent, vice president of autonomous technology at Lyft. Thats why 10 percent of our engineers are already focused on developing self-driving technology  and well continue to grow that team in the months ahead.

And many other companies, from Alphabets Waymo unit in Silicon Valley to major auto manufacturers in Detroit and Europe, are also working on autonomous-driving technology.  Continue reading the main story         Advertisement   Continue reading the main story       Lyft is taking a markedly different approach from Uber. While Ubers self-driving plans have mostly been a solo effort, Lyft has announced what it calls its Open Platform Initiative , a way to develop autonomous vehicle technology in conjunction with automakers and technology companies. We want to bring the whole industry together with this, and we think theres a unique opportunity in time right now for Lyft to become a leader while doing it, said Raj Kapoor, Lyfts chief strategy officer, in a press event at the companys San Francisco headquarters. Perhaps the best way to understand the initiative is through the lens of the smartphone. Ubers approach is closer to that of Apple: Both companies want to control most of the product, whether the software or the hardware.

Both companies are creating software that many different hardware manufacturers can use, while developing the technology collaboratively with hardware partners. In Lyfts ideal world, that could mean a quicker spread of Lyfts technology among automakers. Automakers are scrambling to develop their own self-driving technology as they imagine how they might operate in a future in which fewer people own cars. Collaborating with Lyft could help bring that technology to market faster, while automakers could provide Lyfts ride-hailing network with more cars to serve riders. Lyft is seeing early signs of traction. Early partners include Waymo , nuTonomy, Jaguar, Land Rover and General Motors. The public details of the partnerships are scant, but all of the companies have committed to working together to make self-driving cars commonplace. There are potential drawbacks. Partners could decide to leave the Open Platform Initiative and develop their own software. Or companies could be wary of teaming up with Lyft because it is developing its own self-driving system.   Lyft executives believe that the self-driving-car race is in its early days, and that companies that may consider one another rivals still have much to gain from collaborating and learning while building the automobile fleets of the future. Lyft is not getting into the business of manufacturing a car, Mr. Kapoor said. Were on our way to creating a self-driving system. Then the auto industry can bring it to life.

Lidar may eventually help autonomous cars drive more safely.   Credit Ben Margot/Associated Press     SAN FRANCISCO  In the minds of many in Silicon Valley and in the auto industry, it is inevitable that cars will eventually drive themselves. It is simply a matter of how long it will take for the technology to be reliably safe. But as indicated by Googles challenges with the so-called handoff between machines and humans  not to mention Ubers problems during recent tests on the streets of San Francisco  there is a lot more work to be done before self-driving cars are ready for the mainstream. Here are some of the challenges facing technologists. The ability to respond to spoken commands or hand signals from law enforcement or highway safety employees. There are subtle signals that humans take for granted: the body language of a traffic control officer, for example, or a bicyclist trying to make eye contact. How do you teach a computer human intuition ? Perhaps the only way is endless hours of road testing, so that machines can learn the interactions that humans have been socialized to understand.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   Driving safely despite unclear lane markings. This, too, is a question of intuition. The most challenging driving environments require self-driving cars to make guidance decisions without white lines, Botts Dots (those little plastic bumps that mark lanes) or clear demarcations at the edge of the road.  Continue reading the main story         Advertisement   Continue reading the main story       Notably, California may phase out Botts Dots on its roads because, among other issues, they are not believed to be an effective lane-marking tool for automated vehicles. In short, the highway infrastructure is going to have to change over time to interact with computer-driven vehicles. Reliably recognizing traffic lights that are not working. Picking out traffic lights is now done reliably by self-driving car vision systems. Making correct decisions in the event of a power failure is more challenging. Yet again, its a question of teaching a machine human intuition and how to cooperate among multiple vehicles.

Merging into rapidly flowing lanes of traffic is a delicate task that often requires eye contact with oncoming drivers. How can machines subtly let other machines and humans know what they are trying to do? Researchers are considering solutions like electronic signs and car-to-car communications systems. Detecting which small objects in the roadway must be avoided. Recognizing objects is something that machine-vision systems can now do reliably. But so-called scene understanding, which would inform a determination like whether a bag on the road is empty or hides a brick inside, is more challenging for computer vision systems. The ability to operate safely in all weather conditions. Software improvements to lidar (short for light detection and ranging) technology may help someday, but not yet. Lidar systems cant be fooled by darkness or sun glare. But if youre wondering whether the lidar systems in self-driving cars have problems in rain or snow, youre on to something. Heavy rain or snow can confuse current car radar and lidar systems, making it necessary for humans to intervene.  Cybersecurity . There is no evidence yet that autonomous cars will be any more secure than any other networked computers. A self-driving car is a collection of networked computers and sensors wirelessly connected to the outside world. Keeping the systems safe from intruders who may wish to crash cars  or turn them into weapons  may be the most daunting challenge facing autonomous driving.

Barra, the chief executive of General Motors, is seeking to expand and accelerate the companys development of self-driving cars.   Credit Paul Sancya/Associated Press     In the race to develop self-driving cars, General Motors is expanding its operations near Silicon Valley. The automaker said on Thursday that it planned to hire 1,100 people and invest $14 million at a new development center in San Francisco that would spearhead the companys work on self-driving cars. G.M. and Cruise Automation, an autonomous-driving software company G.M. acquired a year ago, have been testing more than 50 Chevrolet Bolt electric cars equipped with self-driving technology on public roads in San Francisco; Scottsdale, Ariz.; and the Detroit area. The new investment and hiring are intended to expand and accelerate their work, G.M.s chief executive, Mary T. Barra, said in a statement.

Continue reading the main story         Advertisement   Continue reading the main story       The move comes as traditional automakers are rushing to partner with and acquire technology companies amid a global race to develop cars capable of driving themselves safely with little input from passengers. In February , Ford Motor said it planned to invest $1 billion over the next five years in Argo AI, an artificial intelligence company, as part of its own push to develop self-driving cars. Ford has also vowed to begin production of a fully automated car  with no steering wheel and no pedals  by 2021. Similar efforts are underway at Audi, BMW and other car companies. The automotive giants are competing with technology companies that appear to be leading the self-driving race. Googles automated car subsidiary, Waymo, has racked up more than 200 million miles of driving with various test vehicles, while Tesla already offers its semi-automated Autopilot system in its electric vehicles.

Traditional automakers from Detroit and around the world are responding by trying to build a greater presence in the Silicon Valley region, to compete for both technology and engineering talent. G.M. plans to introduce a system called SuperCruise as an option in certain Cadillac models, possibly by the end of this year. SuperCruise is supposed to be capable of piloting a car on limited-access highways, although it will require drivers to keep their eyes on the road. SuperCruise is not based on technology developed by Cruise Automation. G.M. acquired Cruise for a reported $1 billion. G.M.s investment will upgrade an existing location in San Francisco that will more than double Cruise Automations research and development space. As autonomous car technology matures, our companys talent needs will continue to increase, said Kyle Vogt, Cruise Automations chief executive. Accessing the world-class talent pool that the San Francisco Bay Area offers is one of the many reasons we plan to grow our presence in the state.   Correction: April 21, 2017   An article last Friday about General Motors plans to expand its self-driving car operations in Silicon Valley referred incorrectly to SuperCruise technology, which G.M. plans to offer as an option in certain models and is supposed to be capable of piloting a car on limited-access highways. It is separate from technology developed by Cruise Automation, an autonomous-driving software company G.M. acquired; Cruise Automation is not part of the basis of the SuperCruise technology.

Credit Ford     How do you create a map showing every road in the United States, with the precise location of every stop sign, all the lane markings, every exit ramp and every traffic light  and update it in real time as traffic is rerouted around construction and accidents? Thats a challenge that automakers and technology companies are confronting in their race to develop self-driving cars, the kind that someday will let you sit back and read or watch TV on the way to work each morning. The need for highly detailed, three-dimensional, computerized maps  which pinpoint a cars location and understand its surroundings  is often overlooked amid all the hype about autonomous vehicles. The chatter tends to focus more on the various sensors that enable cars to see the road and any obstacles in front of them. Those sensors include radar, cameras and a laser-based kind of radar known as lidar. But digital maps are an equally critical piece of the puzzle. If we want to have autonomous cars everywhere, we have to have digital maps everywhere, said Amnon Shashua, chief technology officer at Mobileye , an Israeli company that makes advanced vision systems for automobiles.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   Creating them, however, is a monumental task. There are more than four million miles of roads in the United States. And compared with the maps used by GPS and navigation systems, the level of precision must be much greater. Navigational maps typically locate a cars position within several yards. Digital maps for autonomous cars must know the locations of cars, curbs and other objects within about four inches.  Continue reading the main story         Advertisement   Continue reading the main story       So far the drive to create digital maps has been slow. Googles former self-driving car division  now a company called Waymo  has created maps for roads around its headquarters in Mountain View, Calif., and a handful of other cities, including Austin, Tex., and Kirkland, Wash. Waymo creates the maps by driving around cars equipped with spinning lidar units mounted on their roofs that shoot out laser beams, creating images of the road and the surroundings. Human engineers, in a time-consuming process, then go over the images and tag the objects that are found, like stop signs, buildings, stoplights and do-not-enter signs. The laser equipment needed to do this scanning is expensive  it can cost $100,000 or more to outfit just one car to do this job.            5 Things That Give Self-Driving Cars Headaches    Another company, Here , which was started by Nokia and then acquired by the German automakers BMW, Daimler and Audi, is also mapping roads in the United States and Europe. It is drawing on data scooped up by scanning systems that trucking companies have agreed to install on their vehicles. Here also has its own fleet of cars collecting images, and is working on algorithms to enable computers to annotate the maps. The effort may soon shift into higher gear, thanks to an idea borrowed from the internet that has helped in other fields: crowdsourcing. Mobileye supplies front-facing camera systems that enable cars to detect obstacles and brake to prevent or mitigate collisions. Starting with 2018 models, both Volkswagen and BMW will outfit their vehicles with Mobileye systems that can also transmit their precise locations and images of the roads they are traveling, which can be synthesized into one giant digital map. Mr. Shashua said his company expected to sign on many other automakers to do the same. You can leverage the fact that you will have millions of cars with cameras  almost all the new cars that hit the road, he said. This is a force multiplier. Others are thinking along the same lines. A technology start-up called Civil Maps is trying to develop its own image-vacuuming device and hopes to persuade automakers to install it in cars and trucks. The company is also working on artificial intelligence technology that it hopes will automate the annotating of maps  the other big technological challenge. Its work has attracted an investment from Ford Motor.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   For full autonomy, we believe we need to have a high-definition map of the area weve been operating in, a map annotated with what are the permanent fixed objects in that area, said Raj Nair, the global product development chief at Ford, which has vowed to begin producing a fully autonomous car  with no steering wheel and no pedals  by 2021. Mobileye envisions assembling its data into a giant map called Road Book, and plans to share it with Here. The idea is that Here at some point will license the mapping information for use by self-driving cars and Mobileye will get a share of that, Mr. Shashua said. Some of the money will go back to automakers like VW and BMW that add the mapping capability to their cars. There is a revenue-sharing model between us and the carmakers, he said, noting that map services are a future business. Consumers would be paying for map services for their autonomous cars.  Photo        In an image from the Ford digital map of Mcity, colors denote objects like road signs and a fence that were detected by a laser-based sensing system.   Credit Ford    The reason digital maps are so important is that even the most advanced sensors, like radar and cameras, are not enough to enable a car to navigate a chaotic and changing world safely enough to allow occupants to lean back and take a snooze. Digital maps ease the burden by helping give foresight to a cars computers, and adding redundancy to the cars understanding of the situation it faces, said Civil Maps chief executive, Sravan Puttagunta. Radar and cameras cannot always recognize a stop sign if pedestrians are standing in the way or the sign has been knocked down, he explained. But if the map knows there is a stop sign ahead, then the sensors just need to confirm it, Mr. Puttagunta said. Then the load on the sensors and processor is much lower. The need for data that can complement radar and camera readings was made clear last year when an Ohio man, Joshua Brown, died in a crash in Florida when his 2015 Tesla Model S was operating under control of the electric car s Autopilot system. As the car was traveling on a state highway at 74 miles per hour, a white tractor-trailer was crossing the road, but Autopilots sensors had trouble recognizing it against a bright sky. Tesla has said Autopilot may have thought the truck was an overpass.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   A digital map could have shown that there was no overpass in that location and that an obstacle was blocking the road. As it was, neither the car nor Mr. Brown hit the brakes. An investigation of the crash by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration found no safety defect in Teslas Autopilot technology. It added, however, that Tesla needed to be cautious in its marketing and advertising not to overstate the capabilities of Autopilot, a semiautonomous system that requires drivers to keep their eyes on the road and hands on the steering wheel. Last fall, Tesla updated Autopilot, and one upgrade is a basic use of digital mapping. Cars that have the new software, known as Version 8, note the positions of road signs, bridges and other objects, and send the data to a Tesla database that other Tesla vehicles can draw on to make safe driving decisions. Tesla calls this fleet learning.   A version of this article appears in print on March 3, 2017, on Page B1 of the New York edition with the headline: Creating a Road Map for the Self-Driving Car.

One perk  or hazard, I suppose  of being a technology writer for the past few years has been getting invited to ride in a bunch of autonomous vehicles. Ive been shuttled around in nearly a dozen self-driving prototypes, including a Ford in Michigan, an Uber in Pennsylvania and a Chrysler minivan in the California desert. Whenever anyone asks what its like to ride in self-driving cars, my reply is: Which self-driving cars? Casual observers tend to talk about the progress of autonomous vehicles as if theyre a homogeneous category, but there is an entire spectrum of capability and safety. Ive had calm and boring drives, and terrifying white-knuckle trips. The best results arent always from the companies with the most money or the most sophisticated marketing campaigns. This week, the self-driving car industry reached a turning point, one at which the mixed progress of self-driving car projects became very clear.

Since the crash, Arizona officials have ordered Uber to suspend its autonomous vehicle testing program in the state, and Uber is not renewing its permit to test self-driving cars in California . In addition, Lior Ron, an executive who led Uber Freight and was involved in the companys early self-driving efforts, is leaving the company .

(Sorry about the car puns  its an occupational hazard.) The company announced this week that over the next two years it would order up to 20,000 electric vehicles from Jaguar Land Rover for use in its consumer self-driving car service.  Continue reading the main story         Advertisement   Continue reading the main story       As my colleague Neal Boudette noted, Waymos announcement showed that the company has an audacious vision that goes far beyond even the most optimistic plans of its rivals. Waymo says that by 2020  that is, two years from now  its fleet of self-driving Jaguars will be doing as many as a million trips per day. Self-driving car companies are notorious for overhyping their progress. But the Waymo announcement, complete with specific timetables, cost projections and firm indicators of fleet size, is a really, really big deal. As Alexis Madrigal wrote in a piece for The Atlantic , if Waymo is within even 50 percent of a million daily rides in two years, the United States will have entered an entirely new phase in robotics and technology. Its unclear if Ubers tragic accident in Arizona will have a broader effect on the autonomous vehicle industry. There could be a regulatory backlash that would hamper all self-driving projects, regardless of progress. Manufacturers could decide to be extra cautious when it comes to rolling out their projects on public roads, in order to avoid a worst-case scenario. But if Waymos announcement is an indication of where the rest of the self-driving car industry is heading, we shouldnt expect too much of a slowdown. Autonomous vehicle manufacturers believe, with reason, that keeping their test vehicles on the road is a public health issue. The sooner they get safe self-driving cars to the masses, they say , the sooner we can avert some of the nearly 40,000 traffic deaths that happen in the United States every year.   That means, unfortunately, that more accidents are inevitable  and underscores the importance of creating a reliable standard to measure the technological progress of self-driving car projects. But it also means that the self-driving future could arrive, from Waymo or someone else, sooner than most people think.

Phoenix attorney Patrick McGroder said he has been retained by the mother, father and son of Elaine Herzberg, 49, who died after being struck by an Uber self-driving SUV while walking across a street in the suburb of Tempe earlier this month. On Thursday, a different law firm representing Herzberg's daughter and husband said it had reached a settlement with Uber. The terms were not given. That settlement does not affect the new case, McGroder said in an email on Friday. "We are in the initial stages of investigation," he said, noting he and his two partners will represent the family members and that they had sent a letter of representation to Uber this week.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   A spokesman for Uber declined to comment. The fallout from the accident could stall the development and testing of self-driving vehicles, designed to eventually perform far better than human drivers and to sharply reduce the number of motor vehicle fatalities that occur each year.  Continue reading the main story         Advertisement   Continue reading the main story       Uber has suspended its testing in the wake of the incident. Toyota Motor Corp and chipmaker Nvidia Corp have also suspended self-driving testing on public roads, as they and others await the results of investigations into the Tempe accident, believed to be the first death of a pedestrian struck by a self-driving vehicle.

Herzberg was pushing a bicycle while walking across a four-lane road outside a crosswalk when she was struck. Video footage from a dash-mounted camera inside the vehicle, released by Tempe police, showed the SUV traveling along a dark street when the headlights suddenly illuminated Herzberg in front of the SUV. Other footage showed that in the seconds before the accident, the human safety driver behind the wheel was mostly looking down, not at the road.

The companys technology is intended to help an autonomous vehicle handle unique situations that software programs cant anticipate.   Credit Christie Hemm Klok for The New York Times        A car wends its way through a line of taxis in the Las Vegas rain, carefully steering around a tangle of sedans vying for passengers. As the black Lincoln MKZ gets closer, the steering wheel saws back and forth, but theres no one in the front seat. In fact, theres no one in the car at all. Its disquieting to be picked up by an empty car, and its something of a milestone: Inside most autonomous research vehicles cruising public streets, theres a minder to keep a watchful eye and take control should things go awry. But with the MKZ, there was no human custodian. At least not one within view. Hundreds of miles away, Ben Shukman, a software engineer for Phantom Auto, was sitting in front of a phalanx of video screens in Mountain View, Calif. Using a live, two-way video connection along with the kind of steering wheel and pedals usually reserved for video games, he was driving the MKZ. While major technology and car companies are teaching cars to drive themselves, Phantom Auto is working on remote control systems, often referred to as teleoperation, that many see as a necessary safety feature for the autonomous cars of the future. And that future is closer than you might think: California will allow companies to test autonomous vehicles without a safety driver  as long as the car can be operated remotely  starting next month.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   While technologies ranging from advanced sensors to machine learning are being applied to self-driving cars, engineers acknowledge that even the most sophisticated vehicles will not be infallible. Developers of self-driving cars from Nissan to Zoox say such technology may be needed to address edge cases  the unique situations that software programs cant anticipate. A fallen tree, a sinkhole, a string of strange pylons, a flash flood, a fire or some other obstruction on a lonely road could make an autonomous car stop safely, but then what?  Photo        Phantom Autos technology provides a two-way video connection between the car and the remote driver.   Credit Christie Hemm Klok for The New York Times    What happens when a self-driving car cant help itself? We want to be the OnStar for the autonomous industry, said Shai Magzimof, a co-founder and the chief executive of Phantom Auto. He pictures the technology his company has developed being used in fleet vehicles, robotaxis, trucks and even self-driving cars owned by individuals.  Continue reading the main story         Advertisement   Continue reading the main story       A car in need of help would automatically contact a Phantom Auto center, where a remote operator could use the cars cameras and sensors to see what was happening, then maneuver the vehicle out of trouble. The technology prefigures a time when most passengers wouldnt be able to take control for the simple reason that they wont know how to drive a car  or because the steering wheel and pedals have been removed . It is a thorny problem other companies are also trying to solve. Nissan, one of the first automakers to publicly address situations in which a self-driving car may be flummoxed by its surroundings, has proposed using a system called Seamless Autonomous Mobility, or S.A.M. Its partly based on the remote control technology that NASA uses to operate rovers on Mars. The current idea is to draw the new route command onto a screen to direct the car, said Maarten Sierhuis, the director of Nissans research center in Silicon Valley. Such an approach avoids any possible communications glitches, and Mr. Sierhuis said the company was working on a more advanced solution, S.A.M. 2.0, but wasnt ready to discuss it yet.  Photo        We want to be the OnStar for the autonomous industry, said Shai Magzimof, the chief executive of Phantom Auto.   Credit Christie Hemm Klok for The New York Times    Waymo, the self-driving vehicle unit of Googles parent company Alphabet, is testing autonomous taxis  but with an observer in the back seat . It is focused on having the car make all the driving decisions, but there is a system for handling edge cases. If a Waymo vehicle becomes confused  by, say, a new set of cones or a police barricade in the road  it can request confirmation from a remote human specialist. Once it receives confirmation of what it is sensing, the car  not the remote operator  then decides how to proceed. The Waymo approach ensures that latency  a delay in the communications traffic  doesnt compromise the cars driving behavior by leaving a remote operator unable to react in real time.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   Phantom Autos technology, on the other hand, uses a standard 4G cellular data connection and GPS information to link the car and its backup driver. The company has even been able to make it work in areas that may have less than perfect service. To accomplish this, Phantom Auto mounted a computer the size of a hardcover book, spiked with antennas and four wireless modems, in the trunk. The car was outfitted with three video cameras, but no lidar or far infrared sensors. Its an arrangement that has already attracted several automotive customers, according to the company, although because of contractual obligations it could not yet disclose specific clients. Where a typical autonomous vehicle may drive like a timid student driver, the Phantom car behaved naturally  after all, there was a human there. He just happened to be sitting in another state.

The company has already attracted several automotive customers, although because of contractual obligations it could not yet disclose specific clients.   Credit Christie Hemm Klok for The New York Times    Phantom hopes its approach will also reassure passengers by letting them talk to and see the remote operator  within limits. As our distant driver steered the car through heavy traffic in the rain, Mr. Magzimof advised against distracting the operator with too many questions: Hes focused on driving. Gill Pratt, chief executive of the Toyota Research Institute, said that while he believed autonomous vehicles would need some sort of additional support and assistance systems in rare instances, he saw them as not something people would look forward to using. Mr. Pratt also pointed out that teleoperation faced several hurdles, ranging from the limited availability of wireless networks to the time it takes for remote operators to become situationally aware  informed not just of the immediate problem, but important context including the location or weather or any other variable that someone in the drivers seat would already know. Kathy Winter, the general manager of Intels autonomous driving group, said that because of these limitations, her team was making every effort to make sure the vehicle never gets into a situation where this would be necessary. She noted that redundant systems  including multiple sensors, high-resolution maps, crowdsourced data and vehicle-to-vehicle communications  would ensure that the self-driving cars of the future would have multiple cues about their surroundings. When pressed, developers like Zoox admit that autonomous vehicles may never be truly autonomous. Zooxs chief executive, Tim Kentley-Klay, acknowledged at a Senate hearing on self-driving cars in January that command centers with humans would be necessary both to deal with vehicles if they have an issue, but also to deal with customers if they need help. In other words, if your autonomous sedan gets a flat tire, someone is still going to have to come out and fix it.

Toyota temporarily halted its tests of self-driving vehicles on public roads after a crash involving an Uber autonomous car killed a pedestrian.   Credit David Paul Morris/Bloomberg     The fatal accident involving an autonomous vehicle operated by the ride-hailing service Uber has prompted one automaker to temporarily halt its testing of self-driving cars on public roads. The accident on Sunday night in Tempe, Ariz., prompted Uber to halt its tests on the streets of four cities: Tempe, Pittsburgh, San Francisco and Toronto. On Tuesday, Toyota Motor said that it, too, was suspending its tests of autonomous vehicles on public roads near its research center in Ann Arbor, Mich., and in the San Francisco area. Toyota has a fleet of test vehicles that can drive themselves, although engineers and safety drivers ride along to take control if necessary  the same arrangement that was used in the Uber vehicle that fatally struck a pedestrian in Tempe. Weve told our drivers to take a couple of days off so we can assess the situation, said Rick Bourgoise, a Toyota spokesman.

Waymo, the autonomous vehicle division of Googles parent company Alphabet, and Lyft, Ubers chief rival in the ride-hailing sector, declined to comment on the status of their testing programs on Tuesday. Those companies are racing to put autonomous vehicles into commercial ride and delivery fleets within a few years. G.M. aims to start a ride-hailing service by the end of 2019 using a car it has developed, called the Cruise AV, that has no steering wheel or pedals. Ford hopes to have a similar vehicle in mass production by 2021 . After the Tempe accident, G.M. said Tuesday, our plans to commercially launch in dense urban environments in 2019 remain unchanged but, as weve said from the start, we will not launch until we are satisfied that it is safe to do so.     Graphic  How a Self-Driving Uber Killed a Pedestrian in Arizona  The death of a woman who was struck by an autonomous car operated by Uber is believed to be the first pedestrian fatality associated with self-driving technology. Newly released video offers clues about what happened.         OPEN Graphic      The accident in Tempe involved a Volvo XC90 sport-utility vehicle that Uber had outfitted with radar, cameras and other sensors and computer gear that enable it to navigate without input from a driver. Although a safety driver was in the vehicle at the time, it was in autonomous mode when it struck and killed Elaine Herzberg, 49, on Sunday night. Ms. Herzberg was walking with her bicycle when she was hit. The Volvo was traveling at about 40 miles per hour. The car did not appear to slow before the impact, according to the Tempe police. It is believed to be first pedestrian death associated with a self-driving car. The Tempe police said Tuesday that the investigation by the National Transportation Safety Board was still underway, including the gathering of electronic data from the car and video from a camera that was mounted on its dashboard. The police reiterated that it had not yet been determined whether any party was at fault.

One start-up has taken to a large retirement community  which is private property  to test, while some companies have also turned to virtual reality testing to teach their vehicles how to behave. At the same time, some universities and state and local governments have been working to create realistic proving grounds where companies can work on self-driving cars without interacting with the public.

It features simulated city streets and intersections, with traffic lights, road signs, parking meters, a railroad crossing and a tunnel. More than 60 companies have become partners in the project. We firmly believe a combination of on-road testing, enclosed facilities like MCity, and computer simulation will be required to develop autonomous technology, Ms. Morton said. The University of Michigan is also helping to develop a larger site about 10 miles away in Ypsilanti, where the American Center of Mobility covers 335 acres at a World War II-era bomber plant. It includes highway ramps, overpasses and bridges that allow automakers to test self-driving cars at high speeds and in more complex environments than at MCity. MCity and the American Center for Mobility are near technical centers operated by several companies, including G.M., Ford, Toyota, Fiat Chrysler, Hyundai and Waymo. GoMentum Stations is the largest such center, covering 2,100 acres. It has about 20 miles of paved roads and a cluster of barracks and buildings that provide an urban environment.

Credit Jeff Kowalsky/Agence France-Presse  Getty Images     SAN FRANCISCO  For Lyft, winning the race to create the first fully self-driving vehicles on the road is a far from lonely pursuit. The companys ethos is the more partners, the merrier. That approach explains the new tie-up between Lyft and Ford Motor. On Wednesday, the companies said they had struck a partnership to develop and test autonomous vehicle designs and technology, with the aim of putting Fords self-driving vehicles on Lyfts ride-hailing network in the future. As part of the agreement, the companies plan to focus on issues such as software design, customer experience and user interfaces. Were focused on partnering with the auto industry because frankly, we think we cant do this alone and need each other to be successful, said Raj Kapoor, Lyfts chief strategy officer. Its one thing to do tests with one or two cars. Its a whole different world doing this on a large scale. The partnership represents another shift on the rapidly changing landscape for self-driving cars, where traditional automakers like General Motors and Silicon Valley companies including Waymo and Uber are all jockeying for the lead.

Allies like Waymo, one of Googles sister companies, which has agreed to work on self-driving technology with Lyft , could eventually become a competitor if Waymo ever decides to create its own ride-hailing network. Some tension has already become evident. Since Lyft began its partnership push, G.M., one of Lyfts biggest investors and partners, has started to test its own version of a ride-hailing network with some of its employees. G.M.s self-driving efforts are largely based on the technology developed by Cruise Automation , the start-up the automaker purchased last year for more than $1 billion. Ford, which is in the midst of a turnaround under a new chief executive, Jim Hackett, has also bet big on autonomous vehicles as part of its future. Ford pledged to invest $1 billion in Argo AI , a start-up that is developing machine learning and artificial intelligence for self-driving cars, over the next five years. For its part, Ford does not appear concerned with Lyfts growing web of partnerships. Some view the opportunity with self-driving vehicles as a race to be first, Sherif Marakby, who leads Fords autonomous vehicle efforts, said in a company blog post. We are focusing our efforts on building a service based around actual peoples needs and wants.

The companys chief executive, Tim Cook, at an event last year.   Credit Marcio Jose Sanchez/Associated Press     SAN FRANCISCO  As new employees were brought into Apples secret effort to create a self-driving car a few years ago, managers told them that they were working on the companys next big thing: A product that would take on Detroit and disrupt the automobile industry. These days, Apples automotive ambitions are more modest. The company has put off any notion of an Apple-branded autonomous vehicle and is instead working on the underlying technology that allows a car to drive itself. Timothy D. Cook, the companys chief executive, said in an interview with Bloomberg in June that Apple is focusing on autonomous systems. A notable symbol of that retrenchment is a self-driving shuttle service that ferries employees from one Apple building to another. The shuttle, which has never been reported before, will likely be a commercial vehicle from an automaker and Apple will use it to test the autonomous driving technology that it develops. Five people familiar with Apples car project, code-named Titan, discussed with The New York Times the missteps that led the tech giant to move  at least for now  from creating a self-driving Apple car to creating technology for a car that someone else builds. They spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to talk publicly about Apples plans.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   The projects reduced scale aligns Apple more closely with other tech companies that are working on autonomous driving technology but are steering clear of building cars. Even Waymo, the Google self-driving spinoff that is probably furthest along among Silicon Valley companies, has said repeatedly that it does not plan to produce its own vehicles.  Continue reading the main story         Advertisement   Continue reading the main story       Apples testing vehicles will carry employees between its various Silicon Valley offices. The new effort is called PAIL, short for Palo Alto to Infinite Loop, the address of the companys main office in Cupertino, Calif., and a few miles down the road from Palo Alto, Calif. Apples in-house shuttle service, which isnt operational yet, follows Waymo, Uber and a number of car companies that have been testing driverless cars on city streets around the world. Apple has a history of tinkering with a technology until its engineers figure out what to do with it. The company worked on touch screens for years, for example, before that technology became an essential part of the iPhone.  Photo        Apple will soon be moving into a new Silicon Valley headquarters.   Credit Justin Sullivan/Getty Images    But the initial scale of Apples driverless ambitions went beyond tinkering or building underlying technology. The Titan project started in 2014, and it was staffed by many Apple veterans. The company also hired engineers with expertise in building cars, and not just the software that would run an autonomous vehicle. It was a do-it-all approach typical of Apple, which prefers to control every aspect of a product, from the software that runs it to the look and feel of the hardware. From the beginning, the employees dedicated to Project Titan looked at a wide range of details. That included motorized doors that opened and closed silently. They also studied ways to redesign a car interior without a steering wheel or gas pedals, and they worked on adding virtual or augmented reality into interior displays. The team also worked on a new light and ranging detection sensor, also known as lidar. Lidar sensors normally protrude from the top of a car like a spinning cone and are essential in driverless cars. Apple, as always focused on clean designs, wanted to do away with the awkward cone.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   Apple even looked into reinventing the wheel. A team within Titan investigated the possibility of using spherical wheels  round like a globe  instead of the traditional, round ones, because spherical wheels could allow the car better lateral movement. But the car project ran into trouble, said the five people familiar with it, dogged by its size and by the lack of a clearly defined vision of what Apple wanted in a vehicle. Team members complained of shifting priorities and arbitrary or unrealistic deadlines.

Steve Zadesky, an Apple executive who was initially in charge of Titan, wanted to pursue the semiautonomous option. But people within the industrial design team including Jonathan Ive, Apples chief designer, believed that a fully driverless car would allow the company to reimagine the automobile experience, according to the five people. A similar debate raged inside Googles self-driving car effort for years. There, the fully autonomous vehicle won out, mainly because researchers worried drivers couldnt be trusted to retake control in an emergency.  Photo        Driverless cars are being tested on city streets throughout the country.   Credit Gene J. Puskar/Associated Press    Even though Apple had not ironed out many of the basics, like how the autonomous systems would work, a team had already started working on an operating system software called CarOS. There was fierce debate about whether it should be programmed using Swift, Apples own programming language, or the industry standard, C++. Mr. Zadesky, who worked on the iPod and iPhone, eventually left Titan and took a leave of absence from the company for personal reasons in 2016. He is still at Apple, although he is no longer involved in the project. Mr. Zadesky could not be reached for comment. Last year, Apple started to rein in the project . The company tapped Bob Mansfield, a longtime executive who over the years had led hardware engineering for some of Apples most successful products, to oversee Titan. Mr. Mansfield shelved plans to build a car and focused the project on the underlying self-driving technology. He also laid off some hardware staff, though the exact number of employees dedicated to working on car technology was unclear.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   More recently, the team has grown again, adding personnel with expertise in autonomous systems, rather than car production. Apples headlong foray into autonomous vehicles underscores one of the biggest challenges facing the company: finding the next breakthrough product. As Apple celebrates the iPhones 10th anniversary, the company remains heavily dependent on smartphone sales for growth. It has introduced new products like the Apple Watch and expanded revenue from services , but the iPhone still accounts for more than half of its sales. In April, the California Department of Motor Vehicles granted Apple a test permit to allow the company to test autonomous driving technology in three 2015 Lexus RX 450h sport utility vehicles. There will be a safety driver monitoring the car during testing. While many companies are pursuing driverless technology and see it as a game changer for car ownership and transportation, no one has figured out how to cash in yet. With expectations reset and the team more focused, people on the Titan project said morale has improved under Mr. Mansfield. Still, one of the biggest challenges is holding onto talented engineers because self-driving technology is one of the hottest things in Silicon Valley, and Apple is hardly the only company working on it.

Credit Jim Wilson/The New York Times     SAN FRANCISCO  Controlling the future of the smartphone was the defining technology battle of the last decade. Now, technology companies are betting that the next 10 years and beyond will be spent battling for control of the self-driving automobile. On Friday, Lyft, the ride-hailing company, announced that it was developing its own self-driving technology, marking yet another companys gamble that the future of transportation will be marked by self-driving cars. Lyft is marking the occasion with the opening of a new self-driving-research facility in Palo Alto, Calif., and plans to heavily recruit new engineering and technical people for the facility after it opens in the coming weeks. We arent thinking of our self-driving division as a side project. Its core to our business, said Luc Vincent, vice president of autonomous technology at Lyft. Thats why 10 percent of our engineers are already focused on developing self-driving technology  and well continue to grow that team in the months ahead.

While Ubers self-driving plans have mostly been a solo effort, Lyft has announced what it calls its Open Platform Initiative , a way to develop autonomous vehicle technology in conjunction with automakers and technology companies. We want to bring the whole industry together with this, and we think theres a unique opportunity in time right now for Lyft to become a leader while doing it, said Raj Kapoor, Lyfts chief strategy officer, in a press event at the companys San Francisco headquarters. Perhaps the best way to understand the initiative is through the lens of the smartphone.

Both companies are creating software that many different hardware manufacturers can use, while developing the technology collaboratively with hardware partners. In Lyfts ideal world, that could mean a quicker spread of Lyfts technology among automakers. Automakers are scrambling to develop their own self-driving technology as they imagine how they might operate in a future in which fewer people own cars. Collaborating with Lyft could help bring that technology to market faster, while automakers could provide Lyfts ride-hailing network with more cars to serve riders. Lyft is seeing early signs of traction. Early partners include Waymo , nuTonomy, Jaguar, Land Rover and General Motors. The public details of the partnerships are scant, but all of the companies have committed to working together to make self-driving cars commonplace. There are potential drawbacks. Partners could decide to leave the Open Platform Initiative and develop their own software. Or companies could be wary of teaming up with Lyft because it is developing its own self-driving system.   Lyft executives believe that the self-driving-car race is in its early days, and that companies that may consider one another rivals still have much to gain from collaborating and learning while building the automobile fleets of the future. Lyft is not getting into the business of manufacturing a car, Mr. Kapoor said. Were on our way to creating a self-driving system. Then the auto industry can bring it to life.

Lidar may eventually help autonomous cars drive more safely.   Credit Ben Margot/Associated Press     SAN FRANCISCO  In the minds of many in Silicon Valley and in the auto industry, it is inevitable that cars will eventually drive themselves. It is simply a matter of how long it will take for the technology to be reliably safe. But as indicated by Googles challenges with the so-called handoff between machines and humans  not to mention Ubers problems during recent tests on the streets of San Francisco  there is a lot more work to be done before self-driving cars are ready for the mainstream. Here are some of the challenges facing technologists. The ability to respond to spoken commands or hand signals from law enforcement or highway safety employees. There are subtle signals that humans take for granted: the body language of a traffic control officer, for example, or a bicyclist trying to make eye contact. How do you teach a computer human intuition ? Perhaps the only way is endless hours of road testing, so that machines can learn the interactions that humans have been socialized to understand.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   Driving safely despite unclear lane markings. This, too, is a question of intuition. The most challenging driving environments require self-driving cars to make guidance decisions without white lines, Botts Dots (those little plastic bumps that mark lanes) or clear demarcations at the edge of the road.  Continue reading the main story         Advertisement   Continue reading the main story       Notably, California may phase out Botts Dots on its roads because, among other issues, they are not believed to be an effective lane-marking tool for automated vehicles. In short, the highway infrastructure is going to have to change over time to interact with computer-driven vehicles. Reliably recognizing traffic lights that are not working. Picking out traffic lights is now done reliably by self-driving car vision systems. Making correct decisions in the event of a power failure is more challenging. Yet again, its a question of teaching a machine human intuition and how to cooperate among multiple vehicles.

Merging into rapidly flowing lanes of traffic is a delicate task that often requires eye contact with oncoming drivers. How can machines subtly let other machines and humans know what they are trying to do? Researchers are considering solutions like electronic signs and car-to-car communications systems. Detecting which small objects in the roadway must be avoided. Recognizing objects is something that machine-vision systems can now do reliably. But so-called scene understanding, which would inform a determination like whether a bag on the road is empty or hides a brick inside, is more challenging for computer vision systems. The ability to operate safely in all weather conditions. Software improvements to lidar (short for light detection and ranging) technology may help someday, but not yet. Lidar systems cant be fooled by darkness or sun glare. But if youre wondering whether the lidar systems in self-driving cars have problems in rain or snow, youre on to something. Heavy rain or snow can confuse current car radar and lidar systems, making it necessary for humans to intervene.  Cybersecurity . There is no evidence yet that autonomous cars will be any more secure than any other networked computers. A self-driving car is a collection of networked computers and sensors wirelessly connected to the outside world. Keeping the systems safe from intruders who may wish to crash cars  or turn them into weapons  may be the most daunting challenge facing autonomous driving.

Barra, the chief executive of General Motors, is seeking to expand and accelerate the companys development of self-driving cars.   Credit Paul Sancya/Associated Press     In the race to develop self-driving cars, General Motors is expanding its operations near Silicon Valley. The automaker said on Thursday that it planned to hire 1,100 people and invest $14 million at a new development center in San Francisco that would spearhead the companys work on self-driving cars. G.M. and Cruise Automation, an autonomous-driving software company G.M. acquired a year ago, have been testing more than 50 Chevrolet Bolt electric cars equipped with self-driving technology on public roads in San Francisco; Scottsdale, Ariz.; and the Detroit area. The new investment and hiring are intended to expand and accelerate their work, G.M.s chief executive, Mary T. Barra, said in a statement.

Continue reading the main story         Advertisement   Continue reading the main story       The move comes as traditional automakers are rushing to partner with and acquire technology companies amid a global race to develop cars capable of driving themselves safely with little input from passengers. In February , Ford Motor said it planned to invest $1 billion over the next five years in Argo AI, an artificial intelligence company, as part of its own push to develop self-driving cars. Ford has also vowed to begin production of a fully automated car  with no steering wheel and no pedals  by 2021. Similar efforts are underway at Audi, BMW and other car companies. The automotive giants are competing with technology companies that appear to be leading the self-driving race. Googles automated car subsidiary, Waymo, has racked up more than 200 million miles of driving with various test vehicles, while Tesla already offers its semi-automated Autopilot system in its electric vehicles.

Traditional automakers from Detroit and around the world are responding by trying to build a greater presence in the Silicon Valley region, to compete for both technology and engineering talent. G.M. plans to introduce a system called SuperCruise as an option in certain Cadillac models, possibly by the end of this year. SuperCruise is supposed to be capable of piloting a car on limited-access highways, although it will require drivers to keep their eyes on the road. SuperCruise is not based on technology developed by Cruise Automation. G.M. acquired Cruise for a reported $1 billion. G.M.s investment will upgrade an existing location in San Francisco that will more than double Cruise Automations research and development space. As autonomous car technology matures, our companys talent needs will continue to increase, said Kyle Vogt, Cruise Automations chief executive. Accessing the world-class talent pool that the San Francisco Bay Area offers is one of the many reasons we plan to grow our presence in the state.   Correction: April 21, 2017   An article last Friday about General Motors plans to expand its self-driving car operations in Silicon Valley referred incorrectly to SuperCruise technology, which G.M. plans to offer as an option in certain models and is supposed to be capable of piloting a car on limited-access highways. It is separate from technology developed by Cruise Automation, an autonomous-driving software company G.M. acquired; Cruise Automation is not part of the basis of the SuperCruise technology.

Credit Ford     How do you create a map showing every road in the United States, with the precise location of every stop sign, all the lane markings, every exit ramp and every traffic light  and update it in real time as traffic is rerouted around construction and accidents? Thats a challenge that automakers and technology companies are confronting in their race to develop self-driving cars, the kind that someday will let you sit back and read or watch TV on the way to work each morning. The need for highly detailed, three-dimensional, computerized maps  which pinpoint a cars location and understand its surroundings  is often overlooked amid all the hype about autonomous vehicles. The chatter tends to focus more on the various sensors that enable cars to see the road and any obstacles in front of them. Those sensors include radar, cameras and a laser-based kind of radar known as lidar. But digital maps are an equally critical piece of the puzzle. If we want to have autonomous cars everywhere, we have to have digital maps everywhere, said Amnon Shashua, chief technology officer at Mobileye , an Israeli company that makes advanced vision systems for automobiles.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   Creating them, however, is a monumental task. There are more than four million miles of roads in the United States. And compared with the maps used by GPS and navigation systems, the level of precision must be much greater. Navigational maps typically locate a cars position within several yards. Digital maps for autonomous cars must know the locations of cars, curbs and other objects within about four inches.  Continue reading the main story         Advertisement   Continue reading the main story       So far the drive to create digital maps has been slow. Googles former self-driving car division  now a company called Waymo  has created maps for roads around its headquarters in Mountain View, Calif., and a handful of other cities, including Austin, Tex., and Kirkland, Wash. Waymo creates the maps by driving around cars equipped with spinning lidar units mounted on their roofs that shoot out laser beams, creating images of the road and the surroundings. Human engineers, in a time-consuming process, then go over the images and tag the objects that are found, like stop signs, buildings, stoplights and do-not-enter signs. The laser equipment needed to do this scanning is expensive  it can cost $100,000 or more to outfit just one car to do this job.            5 Things That Give Self-Driving Cars Headaches    Another company, Here , which was started by Nokia and then acquired by the German automakers BMW, Daimler and Audi, is also mapping roads in the United States and Europe. It is drawing on data scooped up by scanning systems that trucking companies have agreed to install on their vehicles. Here also has its own fleet of cars collecting images, and is working on algorithms to enable computers to annotate the maps. The effort may soon shift into higher gear, thanks to an idea borrowed from the internet that has helped in other fields: crowdsourcing. Mobileye supplies front-facing camera systems that enable cars to detect obstacles and brake to prevent or mitigate collisions. Starting with 2018 models, both Volkswagen and BMW will outfit their vehicles with Mobileye systems that can also transmit their precise locations and images of the roads they are traveling, which can be synthesized into one giant digital map. Mr. Shashua said his company expected to sign on many other automakers to do the same. You can leverage the fact that you will have millions of cars with cameras  almost all the new cars that hit the road, he said. This is a force multiplier. Others are thinking along the same lines. A technology start-up called Civil Maps is trying to develop its own image-vacuuming device and hopes to persuade automakers to install it in cars and trucks. The company is also working on artificial intelligence technology that it hopes will automate the annotating of maps  the other big technological challenge. Its work has attracted an investment from Ford Motor.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   For full autonomy, we believe we need to have a high-definition map of the area weve been operating in, a map annotated with what are the permanent fixed objects in that area, said Raj Nair, the global product development chief at Ford, which has vowed to begin producing a fully autonomous car  with no steering wheel and no pedals  by 2021. Mobileye envisions assembling its data into a giant map called Road Book, and plans to share it with Here. The idea is that Here at some point will license the mapping information for use by self-driving cars and Mobileye will get a share of that, Mr. Shashua said. Some of the money will go back to automakers like VW and BMW that add the mapping capability to their cars. There is a revenue-sharing model between us and the carmakers, he said, noting that map services are a future business. Consumers would be paying for map services for their autonomous cars.  Photo        In an image from the Ford digital map of Mcity, colors denote objects like road signs and a fence that were detected by a laser-based sensing system.   Credit Ford    The reason digital maps are so important is that even the most advanced sensors, like radar and cameras, are not enough to enable a car to navigate a chaotic and changing world safely enough to allow occupants to lean back and take a snooze. Digital maps ease the burden by helping give foresight to a cars computers, and adding redundancy to the cars understanding of the situation it faces, said Civil Maps chief executive, Sravan Puttagunta. Radar and cameras cannot always recognize a stop sign if pedestrians are standing in the way or the sign has been knocked down, he explained. But if the map knows there is a stop sign ahead, then the sensors just need to confirm it, Mr. Puttagunta said. Then the load on the sensors and processor is much lower. The need for data that can complement radar and camera readings was made clear last year when an Ohio man, Joshua Brown, died in a crash in Florida when his 2015 Tesla Model S was operating under control of the electric car s Autopilot system. As the car was traveling on a state highway at 74 miles per hour, a white tractor-trailer was crossing the road, but Autopilots sensors had trouble recognizing it against a bright sky. Tesla has said Autopilot may have thought the truck was an overpass.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   A digital map could have shown that there was no overpass in that location and that an obstacle was blocking the road. As it was, neither the car nor Mr. Brown hit the brakes. An investigation of the crash by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration found no safety defect in Teslas Autopilot technology. It added, however, that Tesla needed to be cautious in its marketing and advertising not to overstate the capabilities of Autopilot, a semiautonomous system that requires drivers to keep their eyes on the road and hands on the steering wheel. Last fall, Tesla updated Autopilot, and one upgrade is a basic use of digital mapping. Cars that have the new software, known as Version 8, note the positions of road signs, bridges and other objects, and send the data to a Tesla database that other Tesla vehicles can draw on to make safe driving decisions. Tesla calls this fleet learning.   A version of this article appears in print on March 3, 2017, on Page B1 of the New York edition with the headline: Creating a Road Map for the Self-Driving Car.
