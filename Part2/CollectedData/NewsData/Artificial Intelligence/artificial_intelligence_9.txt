But It Wont Replace Lawyers, Yet.

What clients dont want to pay for is any routine work.   Credit Jason Henry for The New York Times     Impressive advances in artificial intelligence technology tailored for legal work have led some lawyers to worry that their profession may be Silicon Valleys next victim. But recent research and even the people working on the software meant to automate legal work say the adoption of A.I. in law firms will be a slow, task-by-task process. In other words, like it or not, a robot is not about to replace your lawyer. At least, not anytime soon. There is this popular view that if you can automate one piece of the work, the rest of the job is toast, said Frank Levy, a labor economist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Thats just not true, or only rarely the case. An artificial intelligence technique called natural language processing has proved useful in scanning and predicting what documents will be relevant to a case, for example. Yet other lawyers tasks, like advising clients, writing legal briefs, negotiating and appearing in court, seem beyond the reach of computerization, for a while.  Continue reading the main story         Advertisement   Continue reading the main story       Where the technology is going to be in three to five years is the really interesting question, said Ben Allgrove, a partner at Baker McKenzie, a firm with 4,600 lawyers. And the honest answer is we dont know. Dana Remus, a professor at the University of North Carolina School of Law, and Mr. Levy studied the automation threat to the work of lawyers at large law firms. Their paper concluded that putting all new legal technology in place immediately would result in an estimated 13 percent decline in lawyers hours. A more realistic adoption rate would cut hours worked by lawyers by 2.5 percent annually over five years, the paper said. The research also suggests that basic document review has already been outsourced or automated at large law firms, with only 4 percent of lawyers time now spent on that task.

Credit Jason Henry for The New York Times    Their gradualist conclusion is echoed in broader research on jobs and technology. In January, the McKinsey Global Institute found that while nearly half of all tasks could be automated with current technology, only 5 percent of jobs could be entirely automated. Applying its definition of current technology  widely available or at least being tested in a lab  McKinsey estimates that 23 percent of a lawyers job can be automated. Technology will unbundle aspects of legal work over the next decade or two rather than the next year or two, legal experts say. Highly paid lawyers will spend their time on work on the upper rungs of the legal task ladder. Other legal services will be performed by nonlawyers  the legal equivalent of nurse practitioners  or by technology.

Those tasks are already being automated and outsourced, both by the firms themselves and by outside suppliers like Axiom, Thomson Reuters, Elevate and the Big Four accounting firms. So the law firm partner of the future will be the leader of a team, and more than one of the players will be a machine, said Michael Mills, a lawyer and chief strategy officer of a legal technology start-up called Neota Logic. Surprising Spread The pace of technology improvement is notoriously unpredictable. For years, labor economists said routine work like a factory job could be reduced to a set of rules that could be computerized. They assumed that professionals, like lawyers, were safe because their work was wrapped in language. But advances in artificial intelligence overturned that assumption. Technology unlocked the routine task of sifting through documents, looking for relevant passages. So major law firms, sensing the long-term risk, are undertaking initiatives to understand the emerging technology and adapt and exploit it. Dentons, a global law firm with more than 7,000 lawyers, established an innovation and venture arm, Nextlaw Labs, in 2015. Besides monitoring the latest technology, the unit has invested in seven legal technology start-ups. Our industry is being disrupted, and we should do some of that ourselves, not just be a victim of it, John Fernandez, chief innovation officer of Dentons, said. Last month, Baker McKenzie set up an innovation committee of senior partners to track emerging legal technology and set strategy. Artificial intelligence has stirred great interest, but law firms today are using it mainly in search-and-find type tasks in electronic discovery, due diligence and contract review, Mr. Allgrove said.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   More than 280 legal technology start-ups have raised $757 million since 2012, according to the research firm CB Insights. At many of these start-ups, the progress is encouraging but measured, and each has typically focused on a specific area of law, like bankruptcy or patents, or on a certain legal task, like contract review. Their software learns over time, but only after it has been painstakingly trained by human experts. When Alexander Hudek, a computer scientist whose resume includes heavyweight research like working on the human genome project, turned to automating the review of legal contracts in 2011, he figured that he would tweak standard algorithms and that it would be a four-month job.

The Kira program sharply winnows the number of documents read by people, but human scrutiny is still required. Yet the efficiency gains can be striking. Kiras clients report reducing the lawyer time required for contract review by 20 percent to 60 percent, said Noah Waisberg, chief executive of Kira. In Miami, Luis Salazar, a partner in a five-lawyer firm, began using software from the start-up Ross Intelligence in November in his bankruptcy practice. Ask for the case most similar to the one you have and the Ross program, which taps some of IBMs Watson artificial intelligence technology, reads through thousands of cases and delivers a ranked list of the most relevant ones, Mr. Salazar said. Skeptical at first, he tested Ross against himself. After 10 hours of searching online legal databases, he found a case whose facts nearly mirrored the one he was working on. Ross found that case almost instantly. Mr. Salazar has been particularly impressed by a legal memo service that Ross is developing. Type in a legal question and Ross replies a day later with a few paragraphs summarizing the answer and a two-page explanatory memo.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   The results, he said, are indistinguishable from a memo written by a lawyer. That blew me away, Mr. Salazar said. Its kind of scary. If it gets better, a lot of people could lose their jobs. Not yet. The system is pretty good at identifying the gist of questions and cases, but Ross is not much of a writer, said Jimoh Ovbiagele, the chief technology officer of Ross. Humans take the rough draft that Ross produces and create the final memos, which is why it takes a day. The start-ups engineers are trying to fully automate the memo-writing process, but Mr. Ovbiagele said, We are a long way from there at this point. The Good Old Days James Yoon, a lawyer in Palo Alto, Calif., recalls 1999 as the peak of the old way of lawyering. A big patent case then, he said, might have needed the labor of three partners, five associates and four paralegals. Today, a comparable case would take one partner, two associates and one paralegal. Two obvious factors have led to that downsizing: tightened legal spending and digital technologies that automated some tasks, like document searches, said Mr. Yoon, a partner at Wilson Sonsini Goodrich & Rosati. Mr. Yoon uses software tools like Lex Machina and Ravel Law to guide litigation strategy in his patent cases. These programs pore through court decisions and filing data to make profiles and predictions about judges and lawyers. What are the chances a certain motion will be approved by a particular judge, based on all his or her past rulings? Does the opposing counsel go to trial often or usually settle cases? Mr. Yoon compares what he does to the way baseball and football analysts assess the tendencies of players and coaches on other teams.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   The clever software, he said, is changing how decisions are made, and its changing the profession. But its impact on employment would seem to be far less than, say, electronic discovery. The data-driven analysis technology is assisting human work rather than replacing it. Indeed, the work that consumes most of Mr. Yoons time involves strategy, creativity, judgment and empathy  and those efforts cannot yet be automated. Mr. Yoon, who is 49, stands as proof. In 1999, his billing rate was $400 an hour. Today, he bills at $1,100 an hour. For the time being, experience like mine is something people are willing to pay for, Mr. Yoon said. What clients dont want to pay for is any routine work. But, he added, the trouble is that technology makes more and more work routine.

Credit Jim Wilson/The New York Times     HONG KONG  In 2014, Baidu announced a hiring coup in the world of artificial intelligence: It had brought in the Stanford and Google alumnus Andrew Ng to lead a new research lab in Silicon Valley. Just under three years later, Mr. Ng said in a blog post on Tuesday that he was leaving the Chinese search engine company. His departure is a blow to Baidu, which has been betting big on artificial intelligence, a technology that is expected to undergird a range of others, like voice recognition and driverless cars. In a post on Facebook and Twitter, Baidu said: Andrew Ng joined Baidu with a shared goal, to improve life through artificial intelligence. Today, that goal remains strong. Thank you, and all the best on your new chapter!   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   The company now has more than 1,300 employees dedicated to A.I. In a signal of just how critical the efforts are to the company, it said in January that it had hired Qi Lu, a former executive at Microsoft and an A.I. specialist, to become the chief operating officer.  Continue reading the main story         Advertisement   Continue reading the main story       Mr. Ngs announcement comes after the technology executive Hugo Barra left Xiaomi , a Chinese phone maker and e-commerce company, for Facebook. Mr. Ng and Mr. Barra were viewed as part of a nascent trend of Silicon Valley executives jumping to well-funded Chinese internet companies. They seemed to represent a new era of closer ties, and competition, between Americas tech giants and Chinas. The resignations underline how that trend never materialized. Few American tech executives followed them, and Chinas internet behemoths remain mostly focused on their home markets. Even so, analysts say, the Chinese companies have grown ever more innovative, particularly in A.I. For instance, last year when Microsoft researchers declared they had created software capable of matching human skills in understanding speech, Mr. Ng chided Microsoft, pointing out that Baidu had achieved a similar feat in 2015.

Mr. Ng wrote that he would continue working to ensure A.I. made life better for everyone. He wrote that he saw the technologys impact going far beyond large tech companies like Google and Baidu. In addition to transforming large companies to use A.I., there are also rich opportunities for entrepreneurship as well as further A.I. research. Mr. Ng is part of a still-small coterie of researchers who are experts in deep learning, a branch of artificial intelligence that seeks to use computers to emulate the functions of the human brain. During his time at Baidu, Mr. Ng said the lab at Silicon Valley had helped create two different business units, one that works on speech recognition and another focused on driverless cars. As Chinas most dominant search engine, Baidu has long had a lock on a profitable section of online advertising. Yet as more Chinese consumers picked up smartphones, the company has struggled to keep its hold on ad spending. In a bid to surpass its rivals, the company has poured money into A.I. technology that executives say will support next-generation products. Mr. Ng wrote that the lab he helped start and is now leaving is working on many of those technologies, such as face-recognition (used in turnstiles that open automatically when an authorized person approaches), Melody (an A.I.-powered conversational bot for health care) and several more.

Photo by Eric Thayer for The New York Times.  Watch in Times Video          embed            Read our coverage and watch live video of the hearing here . Washington once again will be watching on Monday to see how far James B. Comey, the F.B.I. director, will go in discussing the sensitive investigation into Russias election meddling. Members of the House Intelligence Committee have summoned Mr. Comey and Adm. Michael S. Rogers, the director of the National Security Agency, to a hearing beginning at 10 a.m. as the panel tries to respond to President Trumps insistence that President Barack Obama had him wiretapped at Trump Tower during the campaign. The panel  which is leading an investigation into Russias efforts to influence the 2016 election  also wants to press Mr. Comey and Admiral Rogers to answer questions about what they have found in the course of the federal investigation into connections between Mr. Trumps associates and any contacts they may have had with Russia. Heres how the hearing may play out: Wiretap? What Wiretap? In the aftermath of Mr. Trumps Twitter storm three weeks ago in which he accused Mr. Obama of wiretapping him, Mr. Comey pushed senior Justice Department officials to publicly reject Mr. Trumps claim, since Mr. Comey believed that Mr. Trump had falsely insinuated that the F.B.I. had broken the law. But Justice Department officials declined to go along with his request.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   Mr. Comey will be in a tricky spot as he tries to navigate questions about the continuing investigation. In January, Mr. Comey said he would never comment on investigations  whether we have one or not  in an open forum like this when asked whether the bureau had investigated links between Mr. Trumps associates and Russia.  Continue reading the main story         Advertisement   Continue reading the main story       Republican and Democratic lawmakers who have been briefed in classified settings by Mr. Comey have said there is no evidence that Mr. Obama had Mr. Trump wiretapped. A spokesman for the F.B.I. declined to comment on what Mr. Comey will say on Monday. But our guess is that Mr. Comey will answer the question about the wiretap, saying that it does not exist. Discussing something publicly that doesnt exist is much easier than talking openly about classified information. What Else Will Comey Say? Its harder to predict how far Mr. Comey will go in discussing other details about the investigation  or if he will even confirm that the F.B.I. is investigating Mr. Trumps associates.

Last July, he held a news conference to announce that the bureau was not recommending charges against Hillary Clinton in connection to her use of a private email account, but he went on at some length about her misdeeds. Democrats have blasted Mr. Comeys decision, saying it was inappropriate, violated Justice Department guidelines and unfairly maligned Mrs. Clinton. So far, the bureau has not publicly acknowledged the existence of the investigation into the connections between Mr. Trumps associates and Russia. Typically, F.B.I. officials do not discuss developing investigations. But at times when the press has reported about an investigation at length, the officials will acknowledge the existence of an inquiry. The panel would like to examine the evidence that the bureau has obtained, but Mr. Comey may tell lawmakers that they cannot see it until his investigation is over. If Mr. Comey acknowledges the investigation, it could balloon into a scandal for the still-young Trump administration. What May Lawmakers Ask Him? Republicans want Mr. Comey to explain what the F.B.I. is doing to investigate leaks of sensitive national security matters that have surfaced about Mr. Trumps associates since Election Day. The panels chairman, Devin Nunes, Republican of California and an official on the Trump transition team, has said that the panel will focus on the leaks.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   The one crime we know thats been committed is that one, Mr. Nunes said on Fox News Sunday, referring to the disclosure of classified information. That is a crime thats been committed. We dont know the answer to that. Thats what were trying to get to the bottom of. Were there any other names that were unmasked, leaked and leaked out? We just dont know that yet. Who Will Sit Next to Comey? Riding shotgun next to Mr. Comey will be Admiral Rogers, who, as the head of the N.S.A., oversees the governments wiretapping programs. Admiral Rogers may be more reserved in what he says. During the transition, he was a leading candidate to be Mr. Trumps director of national intelligence, a position that ultimately went to former Senator Dan Coats. Senior national security officials during the Obama administration had recommended that Mr. Obama fire Admiral Rogers, accusing him of poor leadership. What About the Clinton Emails? Since Mr. Trump was elected, Mr. Comey has not publicly addressed his decision in late October to inform Congress that the F.B.I. was examining a new trove of emails related to Mrs. Clintons private server. Democrats have contended that Mr. Comeys decision helped cost Mrs. Clinton the election. Its not clear whether Democratic lawmakers  who want to use the hearing to heighten attention on Mr. Trumps ties to Russia  will use their time to discuss emails.

Comey, testified before the House Intelligence Committee on Monday in Washington. Credit Eric Thayer for The New York Times March 20, 2017 To the Editor: At the hearing of the House Intelligence Committee on Monday, Representative Adam B. Schiff of California, the ranking Democrat, succinctly recounted the coincidences about Donald Trumps operatives contacts with Russian intelligence. When you hear them all together like that, its really damning. Up until now I allowed Mr. Trump a tiny bit of benefit of the doubt. No longer. I am convinced that the Trump campaign actively colluded with the Russians to deny Hillary Clinton the presidency. And that is an impeachable offense. JOHN DIEHL, SAN FRANCISCO To the Editor: The F.B.I. director, James Comey, who improperly influenced the election, investigates whether the Russians did? ILYA SHLYAKHTER CAMBRIDGE, MASS. To the Editor: Re  Britain Furious as Trump Pushes Claim of Spying  (front page, March 18): How long do we as a nation have to mollify Donald Trump in his accusation that former President Barack Obama tapped his phone at Trump Tower? Why isnt it enough that our intelligence agencies, leaders of both the House and Senate Intelligence Committees, and even an anchor from his favorite resource, Fox News, have said there is no evidence? Now Mr. Trump has added insult to insult by involving the chancellor of Germany, and angering our closest ally, Britain, by saying it might have wiretapped him, an idea he got watching a very talented legal mind on Fox News. One can just imagine President Vladimir Putins satisfaction at this international rupture and its destabilizing effect as Mr. Trump offends our most important allies to perpetuate a lie. Mr. Trump seems to think its a show of strength or power to refuse to apologize when you are not only clearly wrong, but clearly lying. Instead, it makes him look like a petulant, inept fool who lacks the strength of character to take responsibility. Now that his lie has caused an international incident, are congressional Republicans going to finally put country first? Will they, out of a sense of decency, admit that a lie is a lie, and show outrage at a president who either doesnt care about or cant recognize the truth? JANE RUPERT, HUNTINGTON, N.Y. To the Editor: Since President Trump is unable and other American officials are unwilling, I offer my deepest apologies to Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany and Prime Minister Theresa May of Britain, and our other friends around the globe. Our president has made irresponsible, inaccurate and unsubstantiated claims many times in the past and continues to do so to his own citizens. Add to these the rudeness and lack of respect for you and your countrymen  I am ashamed. I believe that I speak on behalf of the majority of United States citizens. CATHERINE ROTHMAN NORFOLK, VA.

(No date has yet been set for the Senate Intelligence Committees parallel investigation.) The list of initial witnesses does not inspire confidence in the House committees effectiveness. It should be relatively easy to get at the truth of whether there was collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia over the hacking. I have some relevant experience. When I was a member of Parliament in Britain, I took part in a select committee investigating allegations of phone hacking by the News Corporation. Today, as a New York-based journalist (who, in fact, now works at News Corp.), I have followed the Russian hacking story closely. In November, I broke the story that a Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act court had issued a warrant that enabled the F.B.I. to examine communications between U.S. persons in the Trump campaign relating to Russia-linked banks. So, I have some ideas for how the House committee members should proceed. If I were Adam Schiff, the leading Democrat on the committee, I would demand to see the following witnesses: Carter Page , Paul Manafort , Richard Burt , Erik Prince , Dan Scavino , Brad Parscale , Roger Stone , Corey Lewandowski , Boris Epshteyn , Rudolph Giuliani , Michael Flynn , Michael Flynn Jr. , Felix Sater , Dmitry Rybolovlev , Michael Cohen , Jack Dorsey , Mark Zuckerberg , Peter Thiel , Robert and Rebekah Mercer , Stephen Bannon , Sebastian Gorka , Michael Anton , Julia Hahn and Stephen Miller , along with executives from Cambridge Analytica , Alfa Bank , Silicon Valley Bank and Spectrum Health . There are many more who need to be called, but these would be a first step. As to lines of questioning, here are some suggestions. To the White House director of social media, Dan Scavino: You tweeted an anti-Semitic meme about Hillary Clinton from Donald Trumps account during the election. That meme appeared to have come from an automated account on a Russian-controlled network of malware-infected computers, or botnet. What knowledge did you have of the existence of a network of fake Twitter profiles that supported your campaign and were partisans of Russia? To the Trump campaign adviser and businessman Carter Page: You have said that the Trump campaign approved your July visit to give a speech in Moscow. Provide the committee with a full list of everyone you spoke to during that trip and describe precisely what was discussed. Were sanctions ever a topic? When you met the Russian ambassador, Sergey Kislyak, at the Republican National Convention in Cleveland, what was the conversation? When you returned to Moscow after the election, you presented slides comparing Rex Tillerson and Hillary Clinton as secretaries of state before Mr. Tillerson was announced as Mr. Trumps choice. Who told you Mr. Tillerson would be the pick? Stephen Miller, then a campaign spokesman, stated that Jeff Sessions was putting together the foreign policy team . How were you recruited to that team? What contact did you have with its head, Mr. Sessions? Did you at any time discuss leaking, hacking, WikiLeaks, the release of emails phished from the Clinton campaign chairman, John Podesta, or any other information not publicly available on Mrs. Clinton, or any person related to her campaign, with any Russian national, in the United States or elsewhere? Describe any and all financial discussions you had with any person during the campaign about the sale of a 19.5 percent stake in the state-owned Russian oil company Rosneft. To the former Alabama senator, now attorney general, Mr. Sessions: Describe any communications, not merely meetings, you had with Russian citizens during the campaign. Did you ever discuss a shift in policy on Ukraine to be exchanged for the lifting of sanctions? Describe in full the content of your conversations with Mr. Kislyak. Were you aware that the Russian ambassador was also alleged to be a recruiter of spies ? Did you select Mr. Page as a foreign policy adviser for the Trump campaign? If not, who did? Why did you consider him suitable to serve on your team? To your knowledge, did you break the law during the campaign? If so, how? To your knowledge, did anyone else related to the Trump campaign break the law during the campaign? Did you have any knowledge during the campaign of serving F.B.I. agents and police officers whom Rudy Giuliani, Erik Prince and Mr. Flynn claimed were leaking information to them? Did you advise anybody involved that this was against the law? If not, why not? Did you know Mr. Flynn was lying to Vice President Mike Pence about his calls to Russia? Did you know Mr. Flynn misled Vice President Pence on the matter of his sons security clearance? Do you have any knowledge, direct or indirect, whether Mr. Trumps lawyer Michael Cohen, or any member of his family, traveled out of the country to meet with Russians during the campaign? Do you have knowledge of whether Mr. Cohen, or any Trump associate, directly or through shell companies, made payments either to hackers or to internet companies that ran a botnet of fake accounts and websites on behalf of Russia? On Nov. 7, I reported that sources had told me of the existence of a FISA warrant targeting two Russia-linked banks. That warrant gave permission for the communications of American citizens that were incidentally collected as part of that investigation to be examined. (I did not report the existence of a wiretap, nor do I have any knowledge of such.) This is an issue of the utmost consequence. If Mr. Trumps tweet alleging that Trump Tower was wiretapped on the orders of President Barack Obama was untrue, Mr. Trump is guilty of a slur. If, however, the president tweeted real news, he revealed the existence of intercepts that cover members of his team in a continuing investigation. That would be obstruction of justice, potentially an impeachable offense. The framing of the committees questions matters immensely. Legally, witnesses cannot confirm or deny even the existence of a current national security investigation. The very mention of a FISA warrant would allow Mr. Sessions to avoid the substance by excusing himself from commenting. Committee members must therefore word their questions without reference to any case. I would simply ask Mr. Sessions this: Was the presidents tweet about a wiretap at Trump Tower, to your knowledge, illegal? If so, to whom have you reported this offense? To your knowledge, did any person illegally inform the president that there was a wiretap at Trump Tower? The presidents unwillingness to answer questions about contacts between his campaign team and Russian officials, and the pattern of contradictory and misleading statements on those contacts, are toxic. Never in American history has a president been suspected of collaborating with a hostile foreign power to win an election. The founders provided three equal branches of government to protect the republic. The American people now depend on the House committee to do its job and uncover the truth.

Credit Win McNamee/Getty Images March 23, 2017 To the Editor: Re  G.O.P. Leader Puts New Spin on Wiretaps  (front page, March 23): The dog and pony show of misdirection and obfuscation continues with the bizarre decision of the House Intelligence Committees chairman, Representative Devin Nunes, to brief the White House and the press regarding conversations of Trump aides that were picked up incidentally. The House Intelligence Committee, which is investigating collusion between the Trump campaign and the Russians before the election, is headed by a man who served on the executive committee of the Trump transition team. Huh? And now he runs to the White House and the press with leaked information before showing it to the Democrats on his committee? (He has since apologized for that.) This information serves as a distraction that makes our president under investigation feel somewhat vindicated, which is total nonsense when this information could have come from the White House itself. This would be like Senator Sam Ervin, investigating the Watergate break-in, going to the Nixon White House to brief the president on information he had received. Mr. Nunes has demonstrated that we need a special select committee in Congress to investigate collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia. My only question for both Mr. Nunes and President Trump is: How stupid do you think the American people really are? STEPHEN F. DESMOND PROVIDENCE, R.I. To the Editor: Re  A Smell of Treason in the Air,  by Nicholas Kristof (column, March 23): The Associated Press article cited by Mr. Kristof reveals that Paul Manaforts connections to Russia (the original deep state) run even deeper and murkier than we had thought. According to The A.P., the former Trump campaign head secretly worked for a Russian billionaire with a plan to greatly benefit the Putin government. Sean Spicers reaction to this news is illuminating. He first tried to relegate Mr. Manafort to the role of a bench-warming, utility infielder on the Trump team, asserting that the former campaign chairman had played a very limited role for a very limited amount of time. But most telling is Mr. Spicers second response to Mr. Manaforts hiring by Oleg Deripaska, Russian magnate and Putin confidant: To suggest that the president knew who his clients were from a decade ago is a bit insane. No, Mr. Spicer, such due diligence is called thorough vetting. Its a process that the Trump administration insists is essential for immigrants but not for its own high-level personnel. For shame. JEFFREY CONOVER, CHICAGO To the Editor: Nicholas Kristof reasonably speculates, with aid of information from intelligence experts, that people in the Donald Trump campaign may have committed treason by cooperating with the Russians during the 2016 election. If he is correct, and if Mr. Trump is impeached on this basis, it would be wrong for Vice President Mike Pence to replace Mr. Trump. In cases in which the grounds for impeachment are election fraud or treason, provision should be made, through constitutional amendment, to rerun the election. My 11-year-old daughter, Sarah, offered this judgment. ROSS ZUCKER, HARRISON, N.Y.

Stone Jr., an informal adviser to President Trump, has been asked by the Senate Intelligence Committee to preserve any records he may have in connection to a broader inquiry into Russian attempts to interfere with United States elections. The letter sent to Mr. Stone, a copy of which was obtained by The New York Times, represents the first public indication of the scope of the committees inquiry, and possible connections to Mr. Trumps campaign. The Senate committee asked Mr. Stone, who is also under scrutiny from other federal investigators, to preserve and retain all hard copies and electronically stored information as specified below in furtherance of the committees ongoing investigation into Russian actions targeting the 2016 U.S. elections and democratic processes globally. Mr. Stone confirmed the existence of the letter, which was dated Feb. 17. However, he said he had received it only on Friday, by email.

Nixon acolyte and self-described dirty trickster, more closely since he posted on Twitter in August 2016 about John D. Podesta, Hillary Clintons campaign chairman, whose private emails were hacked and provided to WikiLeaks. Mr. Stone said on Twitter that Mr. Podesta would soon face his time in the barrel, two months before the emails were made public. Mr. Stone maintained that he was alluding to business activities he attributed to Mr. Podesta, not prior knowledge of the hackings. Mr. Stone said he is eager to provide the committee with information. I am anxious to rebut allegations that I had any improper or nefarious contact with any agent of the Russian state based on facts, not misleading and salacious headlines, he said, adding, I am willing to appear voluntarily if the committee isnt looking for the headline of issuing a subpoena.

The intelligence agencies pushing this false Russian narrative through a series of illegal leaks have hurt my ability to make a living and are soiling my reputation, he said. The government is in possession of no evidence whatsoever that shows that I colluded with the Russian state. Mr. Stone has also been critical of the investigation into Mr. Trumps unproven assertion that President Barack Obama wiretapped his phones during the presidential campaign, even challenging the truthfulness of James B.

        Roger Stone (@RogerJStoneJr) March 18, 2017     Mr. Stone has said any contact he had with Russians represented only surface-level exchanges with no broader import.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   In 2016, Mr. Stone said at a public event that he had been in communication with Julian Assange, the founder of WikiLeaks, and suggested they had a large collection of material to publish on Mrs. Clinton and her husband, Bill, in the weeks before Election Day. Mr. Stone later clarified that it was through an intermediary and, he said, perfectly legal. In February 2016, the Smoking Gun website approached Mr. Stone about private messages exchanged on Twitter with Guccifer 2.0. Mr. Stone, who initially told the site that he did not recall the messages, later sent captured shots of the brief exchange to The Washington Times, describing them as innocuous. He also pointed out that the messages were sent well after the hacked Democratic National Committee emails were made public. He would have needed a time machine to have colluded, he said. In an interview this week, CBS News asked Mr. Stone about 16 interactions with Guccifer 2.0, which Mr. Stone told The New York Times included public Twitter posts and private messages, and he maintained that they were all part of exchanges, as opposed to separate contacts. Mr. Stone, who believes his communications were monitored by intelligence officials, based on published reports, maintained that he had released the only exchanges with Guccifer 2.0, saying the contacts were so benign that he had forgotten about them. He also does not fully accept American intelligence information indicating that Guccifer 2.0 is a front for Russian intelligence officers. I had never heard allegations that Guccifer 2.0 was a Russian asset until now, and am not certain its correct, Mr. Stone said. He pointed out that he wrote a piece for Breitbart , a conservative website, on Aug. 5, nine days before the message exchange. Im just an available foil, he said.

Schiff, Democrat of California, the chairman and ranking member of the House Intelligence Committee, spoke on Wednesday at a news conference in Washington about Russian election interference.   Credit Gabriella Demczuk for The New York Times     WASHINGTON  Russias campaign to disrupt last years presidential election has spawned a tangle of inquiries with competing agendas and timetables, and with little agreement on the most important things that should be investigated. Staff members for the Senate Intelligence Committee have spent weeks poring over raw intelligence that led the Obama administration to conclude that Russia meddled in the election , but they have yet to be given any access to far more politically charged information  evidence of contacts between Russians and associates of President Trump. The House Intelligence Committee is conducting its own investigation of issues surrounding Mr. Trump and Russia, but the committees Republican chairman has said a top priority is to unmask whoever is speaking to journalists about classified information. Democrats on the committee hope the investigation can force a disclosure of the presidents tax returns. The progress of these congressional inquiries depends at least in part on a third investigation by the F.B.I. , in which counterintelligence agents have been scrutinizing past contacts between Russian officials and Mr. Trumps aides. Officials say the F.B.I. effort will probably take many months or even years, however eager Congress might be for quick answers.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   And, while the F.B.I. conducts its investigation in secrecy, the White House insists publicly that there is nothing to investigate.  Continue reading the main story         Advertisement   Continue reading the main story       It puts us in a very difficult position, said Frank Montoya Jr., a former F.B.I. agent who served as the governments senior counterintelligence official and retired last year. We are pushed and pulled by Congress, and then having to address the concerns of the White House and Justice Department. The overlapping investigations have, in some cases, already been plagued by partisan sniping and misdirection by Mr. Trump, raising questions about whether there can ever be a full public accounting of the scope of Russias campaign to influence the election in November. Monday will bring the first public intelligence committee hearing on Russia since then, when the F.B.I. director, James B. Comey, and the director of the National Security Agency, Michael S. Rogers, will testify before the House panel. But in a sign of how convoluted Russian matters have become, their testimony is most anticipated not for what they will say about their investigation, but for whether they will publicly deny Mr. Trumps claim that Trump Tower had been wiretapped during the campaign, for which he has cited no evidence. The wiretapping claim shows how easy it is  when all the answers are cloaked in secrecy  to send investigators in different directions and muddy the conversation. Representative Jackie Speier, a California Democrat who sits on the House Intelligence Committee, lamented that lawmakers had spent weeks not talking about Russia, and instead talking about whether he was wiretapped. Congressional leaders have not indicated how they envision their inquiries ending, and so far they are still seeking common ground on how to begin. It is a very different time, said Senator Ron Wyden, Democrat of Oregon and a member of the Senate Intelligence Committee. He contrasted the Russia inquiries with investigations into the Watergate break-in or abuses by intelligence agencies, which were bipartisan efforts that operated on a clear track.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   Mr. Wyden was hesitant to lay out a specific timeline for the Senate investigation. Thats the way to really lose credibility, he said. I think you let the facts drive the answer to that. Representatives Devin Nunes, Republican of California and the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, and Adam B. Schiff, Democrat of California and the committees ranking member, have made a point of appearing publicly in sync on the Russia investigation, despite their sharp political differences. Both believe that the House investigation is vital, but for different reasons: Mr. Nuness primary concern so far has been leaks of classified information, whereas Mr. Schiff has tried to keep the focus on Russian meddling. He has also had to manage other Democrats who want to prioritize digging into Mr. Trumps ties to Russia and who have called for the committee to subpoena the presidents tax returns.

Counterintelligence investigations can last for years, and they rarely become public or lead to criminal charges. Agents and analysts, working with their counterparts at the C.I.A. and other intelligence agencies, are still trying to figure out the scope of Russian intelligence operations related to the election, including who was involved and how to prevent a repeat. Exploring any connections between Mr. Trumps associates and Russians, officials say, is only one aspect. Unlike the criminal cases the F.B.I. investigates  from financial crimes to mafia grifting  the bureau in counterintelligence cases focuses less on solving a case than on better understanding the nature of intelligence activity. There is a lot of smoke, but the million-dollar question is whether we can prove what essentially comes down to a criminal violation, said Mr. Montoya, who handled the fallout from the disclosures by Edward J. Snowden, the former National Security Agency contractor. If there are smoking guns out there, its likely going to take a human being to say what has happened. Because it is a counterintelligence investigation, it can just go on and on. Even then, agents may not be able to answer one of the central questions swirling in the Washington maelstrom: whether anyone from the Trump campaign colluded with Moscow to influence the election. American officials say they have so far found no proof of that. But current and former officials say they uncovered evidence that Mr. Trumps associates were in repeated contact with Russian officials and others close to President Vladimir V. Putin  including people tied to Russian intelligence. In recent weeks, it emerged that Roger J. Stone Jr., a longtime adviser to Mr. Trump, had communicated with Guccifer 2.0 , the online persona believed to be a front for Russian intelligence officials involved in disseminating emails stolen from the Democratic National Committee. Mr. Stone has denied there was anything improper about the contact, and he was one of many, including political operatives and journalists, to communicate with the hackers. Michael T. Flynn, a Trump campaign adviser who went on to be his national security adviser, was paid more than $65,000 by companies linked to Russia in 2015, according to congressional investigators. Mr. Flynn was forced to resign after misrepresenting his conversations with the Russian ambassador to the United States.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   Last July, the same month that WikiLeaks began releasing the hacked emails from the Democratic committee, Carter Page, a foreign policy adviser to Mr. Trump, visited Moscow for a speaking engagement. Mr. Page has declined to say whom he met there, but has said they were mostly scholars. American intelligence agencies also intercepted communications of Russian officials, some of them within the Kremlin, in which they discussed their contacts with Trump associates. Foreign allies last year began providing the United States with intelligence indicating possible meetings between Russian officials and associates of Mr. Trump. It is not clear if American intelligence has confirmed whether those meetings actually took place. Even if the F.B.I. unearths evidence that a Trump associate had colluded with Russia in the presidential election, finding a way to use the information in court would be very difficult. American intelligence agencies would fiercely resist disclosing how they had obtained their information. Its very unusual to be involved in something that ends up in an arrest, said Christopher Lynch, a former F.B.I. and C.I.A. counterintelligence analyst. We may know what happens but not be able to do anything about it. Former agents have stories of cases that broke surprisingly after long stretches with no developments. But those cases did not require giving updates to Congress and the American people. This is unprecedented, Mr. Montoya said. When is the last time we had to work on a counterintelligence matter thats so public?   Michael S. Schmidt contributed reporting.
