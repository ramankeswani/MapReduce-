They were all equally, and impressively, fast, the researchers reported in Biology Letters in March. _________   Think you know viper?

Credit Gene J. Puskar/Associated Press     Have you ever boycotted an item or brand because of the actions, beliefs or statements of the company or the person who sells it? Do social, environmental or political concerns factor into your decisions about what you buy or dont buy? Why or why not? In  Shopping Becomes a Political Act in the Trump Era , Julie Creswell and Rachel Abrams write: A couple of weeks ago, people boycotted Nordstrom for one reason: The department store sold Ivanka Trump products.  Now people are boycotting Nordstrom for another reason: The store said it would not sell her products.  These days, a shirt is not always just a shirt, and a store is not always just a store. Handbags, dresses and other ordinary items  and where they are bought  have become politicized, turning shopping decisions into acts of protest for the millions of people in pro- and anti-President Trump camps. Under Armour, L.L. Bean, T.J. Maxx and many other companies have already been pulled into a sort of ideological tug of war. Students: Read the entire article, then tell us:  What did you think about while you were reading the article? At what points did you identify, or not, with the details? Why?

Credit Yana Paskova for The New York Times     Do you like to stay up on whats going on in politics and the government? How much are you following the news lately? When politics stories appear on social media, do you click on them? Have you noticed an increase in civics-related conversations recently among your friends, family members or teachers? How much is civics on your radar? Discuss the importance and priority of civics in your personal life and school. In  The Snapchat Cohort Gets Into Politics, and Civics Is Cool , Elizabeth Harris writes: In Bridgette Francis Advanced Placement comparative government class at the College of Staten Island High School for International Studies, there was palpable excitement over a recent project  on the North American Free Trade Agreement.  In the hallways of Middle School 447 in Brooklyn, talk of gay rights and President Trumps executive order on immigration has replaced chatter about the Kardashians or Beyonce, or somebodys new sneakers, said Leslie Hughes, a seventh-grade English teacher.  And at Riverside High School in Greer, S.C., theyre talking about Jeff Sessions and theyre talking about Betsy DeVos, said Lindsey Beam, a science teacher and adviser to the youths in the government club.  These are signs of unusual times.  With Mr. Trump in the White House, the obsession with politics that has many adult Americans fiercely focused on the Senates latest confirmation hearing and the presidents last Twitter message has filtered down to those not yet of voting age. High school and even middle school students are showing a level of civic engagement not seen in years, their teachers and principals say. Students: Read the entire article, then tell us:  Are you seeing an increase in class discussions about government, civics and politics? If so, how do you feel about them? Do you feel you know enough about these topics to participate, if a conversation occurs in class? Why or why not?  Do you find yourself talking about politics with your friends and family more often than you used to? What kinds of conversations are you having?

And theyre seeking direction on how we get back to that point. Why or why not?
