Ford sees mobility services as potentially more profitable than its traditional business of making and selling cars.   Credit Luke Sharrett/Bloomberg     SAN FRANCISCO  One of the oldest automakers in the United States is making a billion-dollar bet that one day, owning a car may not be a necessity of American life. Ford Motor announced on Friday its plans to invest $1 billion over the next five years in Argo AI, an artificial intelligence start-up formed in December that is focused on developing autonomous vehicle technology. The move is Fords biggest effort to move into self-driving car research. Argo AI will develop the technology exclusively for Ford at first, and then plans to license its technology to others. The investment is also a way for Ford, which is more than century old, to tap into Silicon Valley talent and make headway in a competitive space. Former Google and Uber self-driving technologists will lead the effort out of Pittsburgh, a hub for robotics and autonomous vehicle research, and satellite offices will be in place in the San Francisco Bay Area and southeastern Michigan.

But Argo AI will also use shares of its stock to lure robotics and engineering professionals from other companies, a challenge in a field where companies like General Motors, Chrysler, Uber and Google are all racing to bring autonomous vehicles to the mainstream.  Continue reading the main story         Advertisement   Continue reading the main story       If we can combine the best of a start-up and marry that with proper equity compensation, then thats the best of both worlds, Mark Fields, president and chief executive of Ford, said at an event with reporters in San Francisco on Friday. The move comes as Ford positions itself as not just a manufacturer of cars, but as a provider of mobility services, enabling people to get around without owning cars. That is especially important as companies like Uber and Lyft, ride-hailing services popular in urban areas, have reduced the need for people to have their own vehicles. Ford sees mobility services as potentially more profitable than its traditional business of making and selling cars. Manufacturing vehicles requires billions of dollars in investments in plants and engineering  costs that are often difficult to recoup. Company executives have said mobility services could generate returns of around 20 percent, compared with the 8 percent it earns on making vehicles today.

There is not a strong enough pipeline of talent coming out of the universities today, Bryan Salesky, chief executive and co-founder of Argo AI, said on Friday. Mr. Salesky said Argo AI was looking to hire 200 employees across its three offices by the end of the year. In the last several months, Ford acquired Chariot, a start-up that ferries commuters around the San Francisco area, and invested in Civil Maps, which is developing 3-D mapping technology that can be used by self-driving cars. In August, Ford also acquired SAIPS, an Israeli company developing machine learning and computer-vision technology. A year ago, Ford opened a research center in Palo Alto, Calif., a move Mr. Fields acknowledged was aimed at making Ford part of the ecosystem of Silicon Valley. Ford is also remaking its headquarters and main development center in Dearborn, Mich., just outside Detroit, into two sprawling, high-tech campuses of energy-efficient buildings  similar to those that dot Silicon Valley. The automaker envisions the new campuses, which will take 10 years to complete, as places that will showcase autonomous shuttles as well as electric bikes and other green modes of transportation. Other automakers are moving in the same direction. General Motors has invested $500 million in Lyft, a ride-hailing service and main rival of Uber. G.M. also acquired Cruise Automation, a maker of sensors and other gear that can enable conventional automobiles to drive themselves on highways.

Platt, left, who was a C.I.A. officer, and Gennadiy Vasilenko, a K.G.B. agent, became friends during the Cold War.     John C. Platt, a Central Intelligence Agency officer who forged a remarkable and secret friendship with a Soviet K.G.B. agent in the midst of the Cold War, only to see their friendship betrayed by a Russian mole inside the C.I.A., died on Jan. 4 at his home in Potomac Falls, Va. He was 80. His wife, Paige Platt, said the cause was esophageal cancer. Mr. Platt, who was known as Jack, was a gruff former Marine officer who for years ran a training program in Washington to teach C.I.A. case officers how to operate under cover. But he was best known in the spy world for his longtime friendship with Gennadiy Vasilenko, a K.G.B. officer whose betrayal by Aldrich Ames, the Soviet mole at the C.I.A., led to Mr. Vasilenkos imprisonment in Moscow. Mr. Platt, who had joined the C.I.A. in 1963, met Mr. Vasilenko in the late 1970s while he was based in Washington, where he was trying to identify and meet K.G.B. officers posted there with the aim of recruiting them to spy for the United States. In 1977, a Soviet defector told Mr. Platt that one of his classmates from the K.G.B.s training institute was working under diplomatic cover at the Soviet Embassy in Washington. The classmate he identified was Mr. Vasilenko.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   To arrange what appeared to be an inadvertent encounter, Mr. Platt had an intermediary help him run into Mr. Vasilenko at a Harlem Globetrotters game in Washington. But Mr. Platt was quickly surprised to see that he was getting along with his adversary.  Continue reading the main story         Advertisement   Continue reading the main story       Halfway through the game I realized, I really like this guy, he recalled in an interview in 1997. Mr. Vasilenko, a tall, gregarious Russian, had been a highly skilled volleyball player whose dream of making the Soviet national team in time for the 1964 Olympics had been dashed by injuries. Instead, he joined the K.G.B., and in 1976 he had been assigned to the K.G.B. station in Washington. Even as they developed a friendship, Mr. Platt kept trying to recruit Mr. Vasilenko to become an American spy, but Mr. Vasilenko always rebuffed him. I never stopped trying to recruit him, Mr. Platt said in 1997. But he never crossed the line. In fact, even as Mr. Platt and Mr. Vasilenko struck up their friendship, Mr. Vasilenko was secretly handling an important American spy without revealing the spys existence to Mr. Platt. The American was Ronald Pelton, a former National Security Agency staff member who had walked into the Soviet Embassy in Washington in 1980 and told the Soviets about a secret American operation to eavesdrop on Soviet communications by tapping into an underwater cable off the coast of the Soviet Union. Mr. Pelton was not unmasked until he was compromised by Vitaly Yurchenko, a K.G.B. officer who defected in 1985. Meanwhile, Mr. Platt and Mr. Vasilenko continued to meet, and Mr. Platt continued to try to recruit him as they drank together, went hunting and shooting together, and had dinner together at the Vasilenko home with Mr. Vasilenkos wife and children.

He even kept up the relationship after his supervisors, who were growing suspicious, told him to break it off.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   In 1981, Mr. Vasilenko was transferred back to Moscow, and the two men lost contact with each other. But Mr. Vasilenko resurfaced when he was assigned to Guyana, and Mr. Platt visited him there in the fall of 1987. Mr. Platt retired from the C.I.A. that year but stayed on as a contractor into 1988, specifically to keep trying to lure Mr. Vasilenko into espionage. But then Mr. Vasilenko vanished after flying to Cuba from Guyana in January 1988. On his arrival he was arrested by K.G.B. operatives and interrogated about his relationship with Mr. Platt. Mr. Ames, who had begun spying for the Soviets in 1985, almost certainly gave Moscow C.I.A. files that contained Mr. Platts reports on his contacts with Mr. Vasilenko. Fortunately for Mr. Vasilenko, Mr. Platt, in his reports to his superiors, had never exaggerated their relationship by claiming to have recruited Mr. Vasilenko to spy for the United States. The reports showed only that Mr. Vasilenko had held unauthorized meetings with Mr. Platt. The K.G.B. held Mr. Vasilenko for six months. Without evidence that he had spied for the Americans, the Russians released him and forced him out of the K.G.B. Mr. Platt did not find out that Mr. Vasilenko was still alive until August 1991. They reconnected and eventually went into international business together. In 2005, however, Mr. Vasilenko was once again arrested by the Russian authorities, this time on weapons charges. In an interview on Monday, Mr. Vasilenko said he believed the real reason for that arrest was that he had helped a former K.G.B. colleague get a visa to the United States, without realizing that the former colleague had provided information to the United States that helped unmask the former F.B.I. agent Robert Hanssen as a spy for Moscow. In 2010, Mr. Vasilenko was released to the United States as part of a spy trade in which four Russians who had been seized by the Soviet authorities were exchanged for 10 Russian sleeper agents who had been arrested by the United States.

The proposal was presented in a 2002 memo written in part by Bruce Jessen, one of two psychologists who eventually helped create the C.I.A.s enhanced interrogation program. The memo, obtained by The New York Times, recommended opening at least one secret overseas site where prisoners would be subjected to constant sensory deprivation and develop  a profound sense of despair. The military, though, did not act on the proposal for an undisclosed non-U.S., unsuspected, secure location to hold, manage and exploit detainees. The Department of Defense, through a spokeswoman, declined to comment on the extent to which the plan, which originated in the militarys Joint Personnel Recovery Agency, was considered. Aside from sensory deprivation, the memo suggested that additional pressure tactics be permitted against prisoners, including those that maximize cultural undesirability, but it did not mention the brutal physical coercion techniques, such as waterboarding, later approved for use in the C.I.A. prisons.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   The memo is included among several government documents provided during the discovery process in a lawsuit brought in federal court in Spokane, Wash., against Dr. Jessen and the other psychologist, James E. Mitchell, by two former C.I.A. prisoners and the representative of a third man, who died in custody.  Photo        Bruce Jessen, left, and James Mitchell   Credit ABC News    The documents, along with others previously released, are helping to fill in gaps in the historical record about the interrogation program of the George W. Bush era. Their disclosure comes soon after the Trump administration drafted an executive order calling for reviving the C.I.A. black site prisons, though the White House has since appeared to back off from the idea after lawmakers and cabinet officials objected.  Continue reading the main story         Advertisement   Continue reading the main story       Also disclosed in the lawsuit were a series of PowerPoint training slides for American personnel apparently headed to the military detention center at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, discussing how they could defeat efforts by terrorism suspects to resist questioning. Those slides  or a similar set  were used in a training course by Dr. Jessen and a colleague in March 2002, and excerpted in a 2008 Senate Armed Services Committee report. Among the potential methods listed are psychological torture through isolation, threats against self or family and the use of drugs. When Dr. Jessens memo was written in April 2002, he was the chief psychologist at the Joint Personnel Recovery Agency, a Defense Department unit overseeing training programs in which military personnel are subjected to simulated torture tactics and mock interrogation to prepare them for possible capture by regimes violating the laws of war. Dr. Jessen and most of his colleagues had no experience in conducting actual interrogations, but the Department of Defense legal counsel sought information from the agency on detainee exploitation beginning in late 2001. Dr. Jessen soon left his military position to help set up the C.I.A. interrogation program, along with Dr. Mitchell. The two men eventually created their own company, Mitchell, Jessen and Associates, which received $81 million from the C.I.A. to manage the program.          OPEN Document    Document: Exploitation Draft Plan    The existence of the 2002 memo was mentioned in the Senate report on detainee abuse published in 2008, but the document itself had not previously been made public.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   The memo recommended practices similar to those later used at C.I.A. sites, such as holding only one or two subjects at a time and having an operational team that included a psychologist, interrogators, interpreters, guards, a physician, an intelligence officer and other support personnel, including video technicians. The plan called for video/sound feed between interrogation rooms, confinement cells and control room. It also described ethically conflicting roles for the physician  both advising interrogators and treating the subject. The memo was written at a time when Pentagon officials were deeply divided over the militarys role in detention and interrogation in the new war on terrorists. Many officials were already uneasy about interrogation procedures being used at the military detention center in Guantanamo Bay. The memos solution to the mounting internal criticism was to have a small team led by the Joint Personnel Recovery Agency run a smaller, more efficient prison.   Lasting Scars  Articles in this series examine the American legacy of brutal interrogations.             The memo also insisted that secrecy be paramount and that the International Committee of the Red Cross, which monitors prisoners of war to ensure they are treated humanely, be kept out of the proposed prison. No press, IRC, US or foreign observers, the memo states. These documents reveal some of the earliest planning for the systematic torture and abuse that Jessen and others would inflict on U.S. prisoners, said Dror Ladin, a lawyer with the American Civil Liberties Union, which is representing the former detainees. The emphasis on keeping the prisons hidden showed, Mr. Ladin said, that those involved in the plans knew that what they were doing was wrong.

While Dr. Jessen was the original author of the JPRA report, the document that the government produced in discovery is the final version that was modified by other government officials for specific purposes, said the lawyer, James Smith, who also represents Dr. Mitchell.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   Dr. Jessen had no role in creating that final version, he wrote. Mr. Smith also asserted that every action taken by Drs. Mitchell and Jessen was approved and directed by the C.I.A. after the Department of Justice and the Office of the President advised that the contemplated action was legal. He said the two men had no involvement in activities alleged in the plaintiffs complaint, which claimed the psychologists had designed and administered the C.I.A.s brutal interrogation program. According to the Senate report, Dr. Jessen drafted his memo and sent it to the senior civilian leadership and commander of the Joint Personnel Recovery Agency, Col. John R. Moulton, who is known as Randy. He requested that Dr. Jessen prepare a briefing to take up for approval.   Got a confidential news tip?

Lawyers for Dr. Mitchell and Dr. Jessen have sought to depose several former C.I.A. officials in an effort to buttress the defenses argument that the psychologists actions were approved by the C.I.A. Lawyers for the A.C.L.U., working with the Gibbons law firm of Newark, have said that they were trying to avoid asking the government to release classified information in the case, and instead were relying heavily on public records. Their strategy is to avoid demanding any information that might lead to the imposition of the state secrets privilege , which allows the government to prevent information from being made public in court cases by claiming it could damage national security. That could shut down the case. If it goes forward, a trial is expected to take place in June. In a filing in the case last week, Chad A. Readler, the acting United States assistant attorney general, and other government lawyers indicated that the government would seek to invoke the privilege to block testimony by James Cotsana, a former C.I.A. operations officer who Dr. Mitchell and Dr. Jessen have said supervised them at one time. The Justice Department requested additional time to invoke the state secrets privilege, it said, because the new C.I.A. director will need to assess whether to do so, and the attorney general will have to approve the plan. The multiple levels of review, the government added, present unique challenges in this case given the recent change of administration. Subpoenas to depose John A. Rizzo, a former acting general counsel of the C.I.A., and Jose A. Rodriguez, a former deputy director of operations, were recently canceled by the defendants, who received statements from the two men instead. The A.C.L.U. is now seeking to depose them.

Martin IIIs house in Glen Burnie, Md., in October. He was indicted on Wednesday on charges of stealing highly classified information.   Credit Nate Pesce for The New York Times     WASHINGTON  A former security contractor was indicted on Wednesday on charges of stealing a trove of highly classified information that federal prosecutors, for the first time, said included documents on sensitive counterterrorism operations, a foreign intelligence target the C.I.A. was tracking and the launch of a satellite. The 20-count indictment that was unsealed in Maryland federal court offered just a glimpse of what prosecutors claim Harold T. Martin III, 52, stole undetected for years . Mr. Martin, of Glen Burnie, Md., was arrested in late August after the F.B.I. raided his house and found an estimated 50 terabytes of electronic files in his home office, car and shed. It is still not clear why Mr. Martin was hoarding the documents, and prosecutors have not suggested, at least publicly, that he might have passed the information to anyone or sold it to a foreign intelligence agency. The indictment says Mr. Martin was employed as a private contractor for the American government from December 1993 to August 2016. In that time, he worked for at least seven private companies, including Booz Allen Hamilton. He held security clearances that allowed him access to some of the governments most sensitive intelligence programs.

Rosenstein, the United States attorney for Maryland, said in a statement.  Continue reading the main story         Advertisement   Continue reading the main story       Mr. Martins lawyer, James Wyda of the federal public defenders office, said he had no comment. If convicted on all counts, Mr. Martin could face a 200-year prison sentence. He is being held without bail.

Privacy Policy  Opt out or contact us anytime      According to the indictment, he is accused of taking materials from the C.I.A., the National Security Agency , the United States Cyber Command, the Defense Department and the National Reconnaissance Office, which is in charge of Americas intelligence satellites. A majority of the documents listed in the indictment against Mr. Martin were taken from the N.S.A., according to prosecutors. There is a 1996 N.S.A. weekly status summary of national defense concerns around the world; an outline of an exercise involving N.S.A. and American military resources to demonstrate existing cyberintelligence and operational capabilities; and an N.S.A. antiterrorism operational document concerning extremely sensitive U.S. planning and operations regarding global terrorists. It appears that Mr. Martin took home classified information just days before his arrest, while he was working at the Cyber Command. One document was dated Aug. 17, 2016, and was described as discussing gaps in military capabilities and details of specific operations. According to court documents, Mr. Martin served in the United States Navy for four years until 1992 and then was in the Navy Reserve for eight years.   Scott Shane contributed reporting.

Licorice contains glycyrrhizin, a sweetener derived from the root of the licorice plant, and is used to flavor candies, soft drinks, herbal teas and other products. Pills and supplements containing concentrated licorice are also a popular herbal remedy for respiratory ailments and other ills. The analysis, in The American Journal of Epidemiology , included 1,049 mothers and their healthy infants born in Finland in 1998. Eleven percent of the mothers consumed more than 500 milligrams of glycyrrhizin a week, the amount found in about 8.8 ounces of pure licorice (many licorice candies and foods contain anise flavorings and only small amounts of glycyrrhizin). At age 13, compared with those whose mothers ate the least licorice, those whose mothers consumed the most averaged seven points lower on I.Q. tests and had triple the risk for attention deficit disorder problems. Girls in the high-consumption group also tended to reach puberty earlier and have a higher body mass index.   Glycyrrhizin increases levels of cortisol, the stress hormone, which may affect development of the fetal nervous system. We know that there are limitations in observational studies like this, said the lead author, Katri Raikkonen, of the University of Helsinki. But we have tried to account for numerous variables, and we know from animal studies that there are detrimental consequences for offspring of mothers who consume glycyrrhizin. Insofar as you can avoid it during pregnancy, you should do so.

The Doctor  who isnt referred to as Doctor Who  is a Time Lord from a distant planet who explores the universe in a time machine called the Tardis (which stands for Time and Relative Dimension in Space). A plucky human companion usually accompanies the Doctor, who faces a rotating cast of alien adversaries. Originally conceived as a family-friendly educational program, the series began in 1963 and, with the exception of a 16-year gap (1989-2005), has been broadcast since. The show is a national institution in Britain and a cult favorite elsewhere in the world, with more than 800 episodes ( a Guinness world record ). The Doctor is capable of regenerating, a concept that was introduced to prolong the series when its first lead actor, William Hartnell, left amid failing health. Mr. Capaldi, above, is the 12th actor  and the 12th white man  to fill the role. Fans have urged the producers to address the lack of diversity when the 13th Doctor makes his  or her  debut.

Mr. Harms, chief executive at MOIA, a Volkswagen-backed ride-hailing start-up, moved to Berlin, which has a growing tech scene.   Credit Gordon Welters for The New York Times     WOLFSBURG, Germany  One of the first things Ole Harms did after taking over Volkswagen s new ride-hailing start-up was leave town. Staid Wolfsburg, Volkswagens home, was not the best place for the automaker to mount a defense against Silicon Valley challengers keen to upend the car industry, and he needed to move. Nobody knows how the world is going to look in the coming years, said Mr. Harms, a bearded 41-year-old dressed in a gray cardigan over a crisply pressed white shirt. The biggest skill you have to have is the ability to change. So he packed up and took his team to new digs in Berlin, where increasingly urgent attempts to tap into a growing tech scene are part of German carmakers efforts to ride a digital wave sweeping the industry  before it rolls straight over them.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   Autonomous driving, electric cars and ride-hailing apps from Silicon Valley, like Uber, are reshaping transportation. Young people no longer feel as compelled as previous generations to own cars. And Wall Street shows scant respect for automakers and their global manufacturing prowess: The market value of Google, which is building a driverless car, is more than double that of BMW , Daimler and Volkswagen combined.  Continue reading the main story         Advertisement   Continue reading the main story       At stake is the fate of the German economy, Europes largest, at a time when the region is only beginning to emerge from a decade-long economic malaise. Germany , in particular, is as dependent on its carmakers as Michigan is on Chrysler, Ford and General Motors. Industry executives here often cite how Apples iPhone quickly erased Nokias once-dominant position in the mobile handset market, and they are determined not to let something similar happen to them. I am convinced that we are going to see more change in the next 10 or 15 years than we have seen in the last 100 years, Peter Schwarzenbauer, a member of the BMW management board, said in a telephone interview. The big question is always, Do we car manufacturers learn to become tech companies more quickly than a tech company learns to be an automotive player? Non-German carmakers have readily embraced Silicon Valley through partnerships and investment deals. Fiat Chrysler, for instance, is working with Google on self-driving cars. General Motors has poured $500 million into Lyft, the ride-booking service. And Volvo, the Swedish automaker owned by Geely of China, provided the chassis for Ubers recent driverless car tests . By contrast, Germanys automotive giants have favored a more confrontational approach. That has been backed by many locals, who have so far rebuffed Ubers aggressive local expansion plans that have often run roughshod over domestic regulation, and by German politicians eager to please some of the countrys biggest employers. BMW, for example, is working with the chip maker Intel and Mobileye , an Israeli tech company, to develop a self-driving car of its own by early in the next decade. It has also formed a partnership with IBM to use artificial intelligence to allow vehicles to automatically adapt to their owners preferences. To combat the likes of Tesla, the California electric automaker, BMW is planning to expand its i Series line of battery-powered and hybrid vehicles. Since 2014, it has sold 100,000 of the i3 model, which runs on batteries and has a lightweight carbon fiber body.

Of the three automakers, it has also been the only one so far to become an active partner with Uber , albeit in a limited deal where it provides a set of its autonomous vehicles to the ride service. Daimler also owns Car2Go, a short-term car rental service; Blacklane, an upmarket ride-hailing app; and MyTaxi, Europes largest taxi-hailing service. Andrew Pinnington, chief executive of MyTaxi, said the automakers backing had allowed it to expand rapidly across Europe, where it has often teamed up with local taxi associations to combat the rise of Uber. This is a game that requires deep pockets, Mr. Pinnington said. The German carmakers digital plans have led to increased collaboration between what have long been staunch rivals.

While not a household name, the Berlin-based company provides about 80 percent of the built-in navigation systems for cars in North America and Europe, and is the only large-scale competitor to Google Maps. The future of Germany as an industrial nation depends on how companies succeed in bringing the manufacturing and digital worlds together, said Frank Ridder, research leader for Germany, Austria and Switzerland for Gartner, a technology research firm. Taken together, the carmakers digital reboot is aimed at rejuvenating Germanys vaunted industrial base. About one-fifth of jobs in Germany are in manufacturing, double the portion in the United States. But factory jobs as a percentage of total employment have been declining for years, prompting the government to dole out hundreds of millions of euros in research and development funds to meld traditional manufacturing with the latest technology. The initiative, called Industry 4.0, reflects a dawning realization that Germanys historic success may not necessarily help the country thrive in a smartphone-centric world.

The company, which is still dealing with its emissions cheating scandal , is the worlds biggest automaker, but was the slowest of the three to embrace the digital age, and is now trying to catch up. That is where Mr. Harms comes in. A former consultant at Capgemini, he joined the carmaker in 2008 and is now chief executive of MOIA, a new Volkswagen service that sits somewhere between ride-hailing services and traditional city bus networks. Unlike Uber, which has often run into resistance from officials in Europe, MOIA plans to cooperate with local governments and act as an extension of existing public transportation networks. Instead of lumbering buses following fixed routes, Mr. Harms said, MOIA shuttles will adjust their destinations and schedules according to customer demand. The vehicles will be electric, and in the future, some may be self-driving. MOIA has yet to sign any deals, but it is negotiating with cities including Hamburg and Berlin. It hopes to expand quickly into the United States and China. In smaller cities, Mr. Harms said, MOIA could offer an inexpensive form of public transportation, even though rivals like Uber and Didi Chuxing, a Chinese ride-hailing service, are already well established in many of these locations. The whole mobility market  transportation as a service  is just at the beginning, Mr. Harms said. Volkswagens recent push into new digital frontiers has taken on added momentum since Matthias Muller took over as chief executive after the emissions scandal . Under Mr. Muller, Volkswagen has set a goal of selling at least two million electric cars a year by 2025 as it tries to rebuild its image and reduce its dependence on diesel cars. In June, Volkswagen bought a piece of the ride-hailing business by investing $300 million in Gett, a taxi-hailing service available in cities including New York and London. But for Mr. Harms, the carmakers best hope of survival is if they can prove the value of owning big factories, even though most previous efforts by the industry  and other traditional sectors  to compete with digital upstarts have proved unsuccessful. A vehicle is extremely sensitive. You cant put out a beta version and then two weeks later an update, he said. We are the ones who already know how to do it very well.

Bannon Doesnt Belong There. By  Michael G. Mullen Feb. 6, 2017 In his first weeks in office, President Trump has outlined plans to reorganize the White Houses National Security Council . This is in keeping with tradition: New presidents regularly reconfigure the council to fit their management style and national security priorities. Some of Mr. Trumps plans, such as including the director of the C.I.A. as a full voting member of the council, are welcome. But some of Mr. Trumps other plans are unsettling and should be remedied as soon as possible  in particular the role he has given to his top political adviser, Stephen K. Bannon. Whats more, according to Mr. Trumps plans for the National Security Council, neither the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the nations highest-ranking military officer and the presidents primary military adviser, nor the director of national intelligence, the presidents primary intelligence adviser, will be a permanent member of the councils principals committee, a core group responsible for formulating policy. President George W. Bushs council, on which I served from 2007 through 2009 as chairman of the Joint Chiefs of staff, was arranged similarly to Mr. Trumps. But it bears noting that under President Obama, both the director of national intelligence and I were permanent members of the principals committee, codifying the importance of these positions. Image Sean Spicer, the White House press secretary, showing paperwork that compares the makeup of the Trump administrations National Security Council to those of previous administrations. Credit Stephen Crowley/The New York Times In my experience there are very few  if any  meetings of the principals committee at which the input of the military and the intelligence community is not vital. With an increasingly belligerent Russia, tensions in the South China Sea and a smoldering Middle East, it makes little sense to minimize the participation of the professionals leading and representing these two groups. The Trump White House insists that the new organizational structure does not downgrade the roles of the chairman of the Joint Chiefs or the director of national intelligence. (The White House and Gen. Joseph F. Dunford Jr., the current chairman of the Joint Chiefs, have both said that General Dunford will fully participate in the councils duties.) If this is true, the administration should clarify that by making them permanent members of the principals committee. That would send a strong signal that Mr. Trump will still take seriously the military and intelligence community. The second much needed adjustment to Mr. Trumps arrangement of the council is the removal of Mr. Bannon from the principals committee. Putting aside for a moment Mr. Bannons troubling public positions, which are worrisome enough, institutionalizing his attendance threatens to politicize national security decision making. The security council was formed in 1947 to serve a unique role in our government. It facilitates and coordinates, providing a forum through which federal agencies discuss and debate policy and, ultimately, provide counsel to the president about how best to keep the American people safe. At N.S.C. meetings, representatives from the State Department, the Pentagon, the Treasury Department, the intelligence community and other agencies speak freely and critically about the full breadth of options available to the United States. Those discussions can get heated at times. They can certainly get territorial. But they seldom get political  nor should they. Mr. Bush understood this, as did his successor. As has been widely reported, Mr. Bush barred Karl Rove, his chief political adviser, from council meetings. And while I remember David Axelrod, Mr. Obamas political adviser, attending meetings early in that administration, he did not vote or otherwise engage in the discussion. Having Mr. Bannon as a voting member of the principals committee will have a negative influence on what is supposed to be candid, nonpartisan deliberation. I fear that it will have a chilling effect on deliberations and, potentially, diminish the authority and the prerogatives to which Senate-confirmed cabinet officials are entitled. They, unlike Mr. Bannon, are accountable for the advice they give and the policies they execute. Consistent though Mr. Bannons presence may be with the predilections of our new president, it results in a blurring of presidential responsibilities  Republican Party leader and commander in chief  that is unhealthy for the republic. Im perfectly aware that political concerns color the national security decisions that any president makes. The invasion of Iraq, the surge in Afghanistan, air operations over Libya, sanctions on Russia and, of course, the decision not to strike Syria after President Bashar al-Assad crossed Mr. Obamas red line on chemical weapons were all informed  if not dominated  by political calculations. But those decisions were made outside the confines of the Situation Room, where the security council meets. I cannot remember a single instance during my four-year stint as chairman of the Joint Chiefs where it was otherwise. Thats the way it should be. Every president has the right and the responsibility to shape the security council as he sees fit. But partisan politics has no place at that table. And neither does Mr. Bannon. Michael G. Mullen, a retired United States Navy admiral, was the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff from 2007 to 2011.

But that does not discourage young players in the dead of the New Jersey winter, where the fields of dreams are industrial hangars with fluorescent lighting, artificial turf and mesh netting to protect the windows. Where New Jersey seems to have an edge is in the number of professional players and former pros willing to train alongside the kids. For example, advising the young batters of Toms River is Todd Frazier, a graduate of Toms River South High and current Chicago White Sox third baseman, who hit 40 home runs last year. (Mr. Frazier has two brothers, Charlie and Jeff , who also played pro ball, and they each have their own training facilities.) In a backyard shed in Forked River, the proper grip for a changeup is demonstrated by Mark Leiter , who pitched for 11 years in the majors. And every now and then this winter, high school prospects hoping to train like the pros can work out with Los Angeles Angels outfielder Mike Trout , a favorite son of Vineland and the reigning American League M.V.P., widely considered the games best player. These clinics can cost anywhere from $40 to $200 a day, and at least one of them, like the sessions run by Dan Richter , who has trained Mr. Trout since he was a high school player, are invitation-only. But the young players of New Jersey are aware that all of this talent in one place is unusual. And theyre not questioning their good fortune. Jaden Grillo, 13, of Holmdel, attends winter clinics and has trained with Mr. Leiter. He is encouraged by the success the pros have had. They inspire me to do better and to have hope, Jaden said.
