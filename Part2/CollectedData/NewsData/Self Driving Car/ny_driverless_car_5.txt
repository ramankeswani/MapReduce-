When Uber bought Otto, Mr. Levandowski became Ubers vice president in charge of its self-driving car project.   Credit Ramin Rahimian for The New York Times     SAN FRANCISCO  Late last year, Uber, in defiance of California state regulators, went ahead with a self-driving car experiment on the streets of San Francisco under the leadership of Anthony Levandowski, a new company executive. The experiment quickly ran into problems. In one case, an autonomous Volvo zoomed through a red light on a busy street in front of the citys Museum of Modern Art. Uber, a ride-hailing service, said the incident was because of human error. This is why we believe so much in making the roads safer by building self-driving Ubers, Chelsea Kohler, a company spokeswoman, said in December. But even though Uber said it had suspended an employee riding in the Volvo, the self-driving car was, in fact, driving itself when it barreled through the red light, according to two Uber employees, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they signed nondisclosure agreements with the company, and internal Uber documents viewed by The New York Times. All told, the mapping programs used by Ubers cars failed to recognize six traffic lights in the San Francisco area. In this case, the car went through a red light, the documents said.    Video by Charles Rotter   The description of the traffic violation reflects Ubers aggressiveness in its efforts around self-driving cars and the ambition of its project leader, Mr. Levandowski, who is now at the center of a lawsuit brought against Uber by Waymo , an autonomous car business. Waymo is Googles cousin company under their parent entity, Alphabet .

Continue reading the main story         Advertisement   Continue reading the main story       After leaving Google in January 2016, Mr. Levandowski formed the self-driving truck company Otto. About six months later, Uber bought Otto for $680 million, and Mr. Levandowski became Ubers vice president in charge of its self-driving car project. Waymo filed a lawsuit on Thursday in federal court against Uber and Otto, accusing Mr. Levandowski and Uber of planning to steal trade secrets. The suit said Mr. Levandowski retrieved information from a highly confidential server with designs of crucial technologies used in its autonomous vehicles in the month before he resigned from Google, where he had spent nine years working on maps and self-driving cars.     Graphic  The Race for Self-Driving Cars  There are increasing signs that autonomous cars have arrived  and may be driving on our city streets sooner than we think.         OPEN Graphic      Alphabet and Uber view autonomous vehicles as using critical technology that may upend the automobile industry. Google started working on driverless cars around the time when Uber was formed, and Google is eager to prove that, despite its size and past successes, it can still innovate like a start-up. And replacing human drivers with self-driving cars would allow Uber to theoretically provide safer rides around the clock. Robot cars would also allow the ride-hailing service to avoid one of its biggest headaches  its drivers. Theres an urgency to our mission about being part of the future, Travis Kalanick, Ubers chief executive, said in an interview in August after announcing Ottos acquisition. This is not a side project. This is existential for us. Engineers like Mr. Levandowski are part of a limited pool of people with the experience and capability to lead efforts on self-driving cars. They are wooed by traditional automakers looking to acquire new technical talent and tech companies, both established firms and start-ups, who see the opportunity to use artificial intelligence and sensors to disrupt another industry. Whats in these peoples heads is hugely in demand, because the talent pool just doesnt have enough miles under the wheels, said Martha Josephson, a partner in the Palo Alto, Calif., office of Egon Zehnder, an executive recruiting firm.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   In fact, Sebastian Thrun, who founded Googles self-driving car project and is now the chief executive of the online teaching start-up Udacity, said last year that the going rate for driverless car engineering talent was about $10 million a person. Current and former co-workers of Mr. Levandowski, who asked for anonymity because they did not have permission to speak to reporters, said he was aggressive and determined with an entrepreneurial streak. Since leaving Google, Mr. Levandowski, 36, has embodied the Silicon Valley ethos that it is better to ask for forgiveness rather than permission.

But in an internal email to Uber employees obtained by The New York Times, Mr. Levandowski said that Otto did not steal any of Googles intellectual property, and that self-driving technology has been his lifes passion, having worked on it since his college days. He alluded to sharing more information with employees when he could in the future. A Waymo spokesman declined to comment on whether the company would refer its claims to law enforcement.     5 Things That Give Self-Driving Cars Headaches  Despite their multitude of sensors and processors, autonomous cars have a lot of trouble with some everyday aspects of driving.             Mr. Levandowski first gained renown as a graduate student at the University of California, Berkeley, in 2004, when he designed a riderless motorcycle that was entered in the Pentagons first contest for autonomous vehicles. A profile in The New Yorker, published in 2013 , said Mr. Levandowski grew so focused on overcoming the bikes technical hurdles that he offered $5,000 to the girlfriend of a team member, who Mr. Levandowski felt was being distracted, to end the relationship. He joined Google in 2007 as part of its Maps team and helped to build the companys Street View product. When Google gave the green light to begin working on a self-driving car in 2009, Mr. Thrun picked Mr. Levandowski for the original team. Mr. Levandowski gained some notoriety within Google for selling start-ups, which he had done as side projects, to his employer. In his biography for a real estate firm, for which he is a board member, Mr. Levandowski said he sold three automation and robotics start-ups to Google, including 510 Systems and Anthonys Robots, for nearly $500 million. After this story was published, the real estate firm updated its website erasing Mr. Levandowskis biography and said that it had erroneously reported certain facts incorrectly without Mr. Levandowskis knowledge.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   During Mr. Levandowskis time on Googles self-driving car project, the companys advances pushed autonomous vehicles out of the realm of science fiction. By late 2016, nearly 60 of Googles self-driving cars had driven more than two million miles on the road in four different states. But according to former co-workers, Mr. Levandowski became frustrated with the pace of progress at Google, worrying that the company was squandering its technical advantage by not moving fast enough. When Otto was unveiled in May, it showcased a flashy video of one of its trucks on a haul through the Nevada desert. The star of the show was the drivers seat, completely empty, as the truck drove itself down the highway. But that test drive was carried out without the proper permits and against the will of the Nevada Department of Motor Vehicles, a move that the agency eventually called illegal. When Uber bought Otto, Mr. Levandowski found a kindred spirit in Mr. Kalanick, who is also known for pushing the rules. In an interview with Bloomberg Businessweek in August 2016, Mr. Kalanick said they were brothers from another mother. After one week of testing in San Francisco last year, Uber backed down from its fight with California regulators and announced it was pulling its self-driving Volvos out of the city after the states D.M.V. revoked the registrations of the vehicles. When asked on Friday about the incident with the red traffic light, Ms. Kohler, the Uber spokeswoman, said in a statement: Our self-driving technology required human intervention. The vehicle operator had time to intervene, but failed to take over before crossing the stop line and manually proceeded through the protected crosswalk. In December, Uber said it remained 100 percent committed to eventually bringing autonomous vehicles to California. Nonetheless, the company loaded its Volvos onto a flatbed truck, and took them to Tempe, Ariz., a city more friendly to testing self-driving vehicles. In bold black letters stamped across the trucks white cab was the name of the truck operator: Otto .   Correction: March 1, 2017   An article on Saturday about talent in the driverless technology field referred incorrectly to comments by Anthony Levandowski, a former Google engineer who started the self-driving truck company Otto, which was bought by Uber and is at the center of a lawsuit by another autonomous car business, the Google affiliate Waymo. The statement, denying that Otto stole any of Googles intellectual property, was paraphrased from an internal company email; it was not a direct quotation from Mr. Levandowski.

Credit Jeff Swensen for The New York Times     SAN FRANCISCO  Waymo, the self-driving car business spun out of Googles parent company, claimed in a federal lawsuit on Thursday that Uber was using intellectual property stolen by one of Googles former project leaders. In a federal court filing in San Francisco, Waymo said Anthony Levandowski, who runs Ubers autonomous car division, downloaded 14,000 files from Google a month before leaving to start his own self-driving car company, Otto. Uber acquired Otto in August for $680 million, about seven months after Mr. Levandowski left Google. Otto and Uber have taken Waymos intellectual property so that they could avoid incurring the risk, time, and expense of independently developing their own technology, the company said in the filing. Ultimately, this calculated theft reportedly netted Otto employees over half a billion dollars and allowed Uber to revive a stalled program, all at Waymos expense. Uber did not respond to requests for comment. In its filing, Waymo said it was inadvertently copied on an email from one of its suppliers with drawings of Ubers circuit board design for its lidar technology, short for light detection and ranging,  that are laser-based sensors used in self-driving cars. Waymo said Ubers design bore a striking resemblance to its proprietary and highly secret design and infringed on Waymos patents.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   Waymo also said that a number of Google employees, who subsequently left to join Mr. Levandowski at Otto, downloaded additional trade secrets before departing. These included supplier lists, manufacturing details and technical information, Waymo said.  Photo        Anthony Levandowski, left, and Lior Ron, who founded Otto, at the companys offices in San Francisco in 2016.    The suit accuses Uber of stealing trade secrets, infringing on patents and competing unfairly in an effort to catch up on autonomous vehicle technology.  Continue reading the main story         Advertisement   Continue reading the main story       Otto was the brainchild of a handful of former Google employees who pioneered autonomous vehicle research at the search giant. Mr. Levandowski, who had been at Google nine years, led that effort. He is a prominent figure in the world of self-driving vehicles, having worked on the technology for more than a decade and achieving some degree of renown as a graduate student at the University of California, Berkeley, in 2004, when he designed a self-driving motorcycle that was entered in the Pentagons first contest for autonomous vehicles. Later, when Google began working on self-driving cars, it acquired Mr. Levandowskis start-up, 510 Systems. Mr. Levandowski left Google in early 2016 to found Otto with Lior Ron , who also was experienced in autonomous vehicle research and digital mapping. Waymo noted in its suit that the sale to Uber closed shortly after Mr. Levandowski received his final multimillion dollar compensation payment from Google. Companies in Silicon Valley and Detroit are betting big on self-driving car technology. And the intense interest has spawned a string of expensive investments and lawsuits. Last year, General Motors paid more than $1 billion for Cruise Automation, an autonomous vehicle technology start-up, and Ford recently announced plans to invest $1 billion over five years in Argo AI, an artificial intelligence start-up formed in December.          OPEN Document    Document: Waymos Complaint Against Uber    In January, Tesla filed a lawsuit against Sterling Anderson, a former director of the companys Autopilot program, saying that he broke his employment contract by trying to recruit Tesla employees to join a new self-driving car company. Teslas suit, filed against Mr. Anderson and his partner Chris Urmson, a former Google employee, also claims that Mr. Anderson took proprietary information and tried to cover his tracks by destroying information.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   In December, Googles parent company, Alphabet , said that its seven-year-old autonomous vehicle project was spinning off from its research lab X and would operate as a stand-alone company called Waymo. Alphabet said its decision to spin out Waymo was a signal that the company thought its self-driving technology had advanced beyond research project status and was ready for commercialization. Waymo executives have said it is open to using the technology in many ways, including a ride-hailing service to compete with Uber.

Mr. Levandowski was named vice president of Ubers self-driving technology, and he reports directly to Travis Kalanick, the companys chief executive. Mr. Levandowski leads Ubers Advanced Technologies Center in Pittsburgh, the epicenter of the companys testing and self-driving efforts. Uber has said it could be years before self-driving vehicles enter wide mainstream use. But the company has already deployed early tests in Pittsburgh and Tempe, Ariz ., where the public can travel in prototype vehicles. In Fort Collins, Colo., Otto recently completed its first self-driving truck delivery, a 120-mile beer delivery for Budweiser. Uber has also struck a deal with Volvo to jointly develop a self-driving vehicle, the XC-90; early versions of it have been released in some cities.     Graphic  The Race for Self-Driving Cars  There are increasing signs that autonomous cars have arrived  and may be driving on our city streets sooner than we think.         OPEN Graphic      In December, Uber ran into opposition to a test of its self-driving Volvo XC-90s in San Francisco, an operation the California Department of Motor Vehicles said was illegal because Uber did not hold the proper permits . One week later, Uber relented, redirecting its test to Tempe and pulling a fleet of its self-driving cars out of the Bay Area. Uber, now privately valued at nearly $70 billion, has raised a dizzying amount of money from venture capitalists around Silicon Valley. One of its early investors was GV, the venture capital arm of Alphabet. In August, David Drummond, a longtime Alphabet executive who was instrumental in GVs $250 million investment in Uber in 2013, stepped down from his seat on Ubers board of directors as it became increasingly clear the two companies were on a collision course. It has been a difficult week for Uber. The company is still reeling from a blog post written by Susan Fowler , a former Uber employee, who claimed she was sexually harassed by a manager at the company and was ignored when she complained to the human resources department. The company said it was investigating Ms. Fowlers claims and other concerns about a toxic workplace culture . Mitch and Freada Kapor, early investors in Uber, wrote in a blog post on Thursday that they are frustrated with the companys inability to change its culture, despite their attempts to help. They also expressed concern about the independence of the investigation, which will be led by Eric H. Holder Jr., the former United States attorney general, and Arianna Huffington, an Uber board member. Mr. Holder has been paid to work on behalf of Uber since at least 2016, they wrote, and Ms. Huffingtons board seat also compromises her independence.

The ride-hailing company was hit with a storm of bad news last week.   Credit Tyrone Siu/Reuters     What might this week bring in news about Uber? Last week, Uber, a ride-hailing giant, experienced an avalanche of bad news. It began with a blog post from a former Uber engineer, Susan Fowler, detailing a history of harassment and discrimination that she said she experienced at the company, and snowballed into allegations of even more widespread bad behavior within Uber. Several of Ubers investors criticized the company and BuzzFeed reported that Travis Kalanick, the companys chief executive, held a meeting with 100 women engineers on Thursday about the issues. All of this was compounded by a lawsuit last Thursday from Waymo, the self-driving car business that was spun off from Googles parent company, accusing Uber of using intellectual property stolen by one of Googles former project leaders.  Photo        Then last Friday, Mike Isaac and Daisuke Wakabayashi, tech reporters for The New York Times, reported that Uber had also been incomplete about its characterization of an incident involving one of its self-driving cars running through a red light in San Francisco. At the time, Uber blamed the running of the red light on human error, which was taken as a sign that a human was driving the car . But according to two Uber employees and internal Uber documents viewed by The New York Times, the car was actually driving itself when it barreled through the red light. Now a fresh week dawns.

Of the 40 cars that began the crash-filled Nascar race, only 25 finished.   Credit Chuck Burton/Associated Press     DAYTONA BEACH, Fla.  Kurt Busch won his first Daytona 500 on Sunday, prevailing with a last-lap pass on an afternoon that was more survival of the fittest than a contest of the fastest. The race, Nascar s biggest showpiece and its season-opening event, was marred by one crash after another, including a 17-car wreck that took out, among others, three of the four members of the Stewart-Haas Racing team. But it was Busch, in the teams only surviving entry, who came away with the win  though not unscathed. This cars completely thrashed, he said. Theres not a straight panel on it. Buschs victory came in his 17th start in the event, and after a race in which he led only one lap: the final one. It was also Buschs first win in 32 races at Daytona International Speedway. He had three previous runner-up finishes in the 500. Buschs team owner, the former Nascar driver Tony Stewart, competed in 18 Daytona 500 races and never won, so he knows firsthand how difficult the race is to win. But he also knows how unexplainable the route to the checkered flag can be.

Of the 40 cars that started the race, only 25 finished.  Continue reading the main story         Advertisement   Continue reading the main story       It was a mess out there, said A. J. Allmendinger, who finished third. At one point, three multicar crashes had drawn half the field into a vortex of accidents. When the racing resumed, it did so without some of the sports biggest names. Gone were drivers like the defending Cup champion Jimmie Johnson, Dale Earnhardt Jr., Kyle Busch, Brad Keselowski and Danica Patrick . It was the races second wreck  which brought the fifth caution flag  that took out Johnson. Trevor Bayne nicked the back of Johnsons No. 48 Chevrolet, sending him spinning into the wall at Turn 4. That could have been avoided, and it wasnt called for, Johnson said afterward, fuming. From the minute I got off of Turn 2 on the entire back straightaway, I kept getting hit, and the rear tires are off the ground.

Daytona is always survival. Ninety percent of this race is to protect the car, and 10 percent is to go for aggression. Even when Busch opted for aggression on the final lap, however, he knew there were no guarantees it would work out. The more unpredictable it becomes at Daytona, the more predictable it becomes in its unpredictability, he said. How else to explain that  for only the 10th time in the races 59 years  the champion won on a final-lap pass? Or that it was the first time in the races history that the winner had led for a single lap?   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   Given that the lead changed four times in the final three laps, the trophy could have gone to any of several drivers. One who seemed poised to claim it was Chase Elliott, the 21-year-old son of the former Nascar driver Bill Elliott. For the second year in a row, Chase Elliott started in the pole position. He used it to his advantage, leading for 38 laps. But late in the race, running strong and with only two laps to go, Elliott ran out of gas. Immediately after the race, he left the track with his father, without speaking to reporters. The race featured nine cautions and 37 lead changes over all. The final change came after another driver, Kyle Larson, also ran out of gas. The victory was the first for Stewart as an owner. If I knew that when I retired Id win this race the next year, Id have retired 17 years ago, said Stewart, a three-time Cup series champion. Sure, you want to win it as a driver. But I can tell you that as an owner, its a pretty exciting feeling. Nascar fans also got their first taste of stage racing, the sports new format for deciding its season champion. In Sundays race, the 200 laps were divided into three stages: 60 laps for the first two and 80 for the final stage. Points were awarded based on the results of each stage, part of an effort by Nascar to add drama, and stakes, to the early parts of its races instead of merely the final laps. Buschs brother, Kyle, won the first stage, and Kevin Harvick won the second, though neither completed all 200 laps. But as the sun went down, and despite the new scoring system, it was that third and final stage people will remember the most.

In an effort to provide more excitement for fans, and rewards for drivers, points will be given to leaders at certain stages of races, not just the finish.   Credit John Raoux/Associated Press        DAYTONA BEACH, Fla.  In a sport known for tweaking and adjusting, nobody does it better  or more  than Nascar . Yet even by Nascars standards, the scoring changes that the series has made ahead of this season, which will begin Sunday with the Daytona 500, are remarkable. Gone is the season-ending chase-for-the-championship format. In its place is stage racing, which essentially divides all races into three distinct segments, each having a point value that carries with it championship consequences. Think of baseballs innings, or football and basketballs quarters, or hockeys periods. Now add extra value to which team is ahead at the end of each inning or quarter or period. Thats what Nascar is trying to do. An even better example might be a boxing match, with a fighter rewarded with points after each round. Whatever the analogy, Nascars vice chairman, Mike Helton, said the sports rules makers were influenced by fans desire for more excitement in the beginning and middle of its races, and by drivers desire to be rewarded for how they race throughout a competition, rather than where they stand when the checkered flag is waved.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   The only wrinkle is that there has been no dry run to the new format. Instead, its unveiling arrives with the start of the 2017 season. Nascar also announced a new penalty structure along with some rule changes, though nothing as earthshaking as the thunderclap of a change in the format for deciding who is the sports top driver.  Continue reading the main story         Advertisement   Continue reading the main story       There are no off weeks, said Denny Hamlin, the defending Daytona 500 winner. Every single race matters. Not only that, but every lap of every race matters. In the formats first test, Sundays Daytona 500 will be divided into two stages of 60 laps (or 150 miles) and a final 80-lap (or 200-mile) stage. The winners of the first two stages will receive 10 points. The final stages winner  that is, the winner of the race  will earn 40. Several drivers got a head start on the system by earning points Thursday night in the pre-500 Duel races , meaning that as many as 70 points could be had in Nascars opening week. Other races during the season will carry a maximum of 60 possible points, divided into three stages. Duel races during the season will also continue to earn championship points incrementally, with the winner again receiving 10 and the 10th-place finisher earning 1.

Privacy Policy  Opt out or contact us anytime      If that qualifies as manufactured motivation, drivers arent necessarily complaining. From our standpoint, you always felt a little bit relaxed once you had a race win, Hamlin said. You would sometimes go into test mode. In the new format, points will accumulate through the first 26 races and carry over for the top 16 drivers, who qualify for a final 10-race playoff. The series will culminate in a winner-take-all format at Novembers race in Homestead, Fla. Now with each accomplishment that you have during each given race, whether youre collecting points for the overall regular season or youre trying to collect points through a stage win or a race win, each accomplishment makes your road to Homestead a little bit easier, Hamlin said. Its all about us making it to Homestead and trying to race for a championship, and I think this format does that. This was not an autocratic decision. A special committee of former drivers like Jeff Gordon and current drivers like Hamlin and Dale Earnhardt Jr., along with Nascar officials, teams, sponsors and manufacturers, convened in the off-season in an attempt to re-energize a sport for which viewership has declined, both at racetracks and on television.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   The stages are going to bring a lot of excitement for the drivers and the fans, Earnhardt said. I think this creates a lot of interest in a part of the event, in every event, every single week. There are ancillary benefits to Nascar, too  like clearly defined commercial breaks in each race. It wasnt only declining viewership and ticket sales that concerned Nascar; there also was a motivation to adapt to shorter attention spans and an aging fan base. Gone are the days when a predominantly male fan base came of age by getting under the hoods of cars and tinkering with engines to improve performance. These days, the thought of modifying an engine on a new car is as foreign as many of the automobiles traversing Americas roads. According to Nielsen Scarborough research, Nascars core fan base is 48 years old. The new points system, and a new title sponsorship agreement with Monster Energy drinks, are seen as a clear attempt by Nascar to appeal to a younger audience. The driver Brad Keselowski said, You look at Nascar and you look back at the way our races were formatted back in the 40s and 50s, it was formatted around endurance  long races, trying to make sure you were there until the end. But endurance is no longer the charm, even in races that run hundreds of miles. Instead, Nascar hopes the modern-day appeal will be incremental drama and continuing excitement. If we created motorsports from scratch today, Keselowski said, this is exactly how we would have done it.

Weekday subway ridership rose in 2016 to its highest level since 1948, but weekend ridership dropped 3 percent. The reasons include rising delays and more alternatives for riders.   Credit Christian Hansen for The New York Times     After a period of soaring subway demand in New York City, ridership dropped last year, and transit officials say the rise of Uber and other car service apps may be partly to blame. Annual subway ridership fell slightly in 2016 for the first time since 2009, according to statistics from the Metropolitan Transportation Authority. Weekday ridership was at its highest level since 1948, but weekend ridership fell about 3 percent, suggesting that New Yorkers and tourists were finding other ways to get around. The authoritys acting chairman, Fernando Ferrer, said on Thursday that several factors could be contributing to the decline: rising subway delays , the popularity of Uber and other apps , and weekend maintenance work that disrupts service. It may be all of the above, Mr. Ferrer told reporters after an authority board meeting. Im very glad that our ridership is at historic highs. If it declines a little bit  and Ive seen those numbers, and its a little bit  there is no reason for alarm.

Continue reading the main story         Advertisement   Continue reading the main story       The secret to success in New York City over the last 20 years is the transit systems ability to absorb the growth in travel from population and economic growth, said Bruce Schaller, a former senior official at the citys Transportation Department. If all that growth translated into more use of private cars or taxis and Ubers, its not a sustainable way to grow the city. Mr. Schaller, who worked on a prominent traffic study released by Mayor Bill de Blasios administration last year, is finishing a new report on the growth of ride-hailing apps like Uber. Mr. Schaller found that ridership in New York of Uber and other apps had tripled to about 16 million passengers in October 2016, from about five million in June 2015. Mr. Schaller is a consultant and said the report was an independent analysis to help inform the debate over for-hire vehicles. On the subway, annual ridership fell about 0.3 percent last year to 1.756 billion trips, according to the authority. But dont celebrate roomier trains quite yet  the system is still teeming with more than six million riders on some weekdays. The new figures come at a time when both the subway system and Uber are facing problems that could influence how New Yorkers make transportation decisions. Subway delays have more than doubled in the past five years, and trains are more frequently breaking down. As riders fume over worsening service, on Thursday several members of the transportation authority board criticized Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo, who effectively controls the agency, for cutting $65 million in state aid to the M.T.A. in his executive budget. But Mr. Cuomos office has argued that overall state funding for the authority, including tax revenue, would increase by about $30 million. Officials at the authority said the funding changes would not lead to fare and toll increases or service changes. At the same time, some New Yorkers have deleted Uber over concerns that the company tried to profit during airport protests last month against President Trumps immigration order, as well as the ties the companys chief executive, Travis Kalanick, had to Mr. Trump. This week, a former Uber engineer called attention to sexual harassment and other problems at the company , leading to more negative headlines. Uber has said it is investigating the accusations. One Uber user, DePaul Vaughn, said that after the airport controversy he deleted the app from his phone.

Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   Mr. Vaughn, 37, who works in the advertising industry, said he takes the subway to work but sometimes avoids it on the weekends. Theres been a lot of work on the train, he said. A lot of times, its a headache. A spokeswoman for Uber, Alix Anfang, said the company took pride in serving neighborhoods that lack good access to public transit. Its lower-cost car pool option, UberPool, helps New Yorkers get to bus, subway and ferry lines, she said. Ubers mission is to provide reliable, affordable transportation to everyone, everywhere, Ms. Anfang said in a statement. Other New Yorkers rely on bicycles or private cars. Citi Bike, the bicycle-sharing program, set a ridership record in 2016 with nearly 14 million trips  an increase of about four million trips compared with 2015. Suzy Bal, a Brooklyn resident, was so fed up with the subway that she bought a car. She commutes on the subway during the week and drives on the weekend, she said. I was tired of taking the train all the time, everywhere I wanted to go, she said. Ms. Bal, 27, said she used Uber on weekends if she expected to drink alcohol, but she avoided the subway. The train traffic is horrible on the weekends, she said on Thursday, surveying the Fourth Avenue-Ninth Street station in Park Slope. Also, its just so dirty. Bus ridership also dropped last year  part of a downward trend over the last decade or so. Weekday bus ridership fell about 1.6 percent last year to just under 2 million riders. Weekend bus ridership fell about 4 percent last year to under 2.2 million riders. The citys transportation commissioner, Polly Trottenberg, who also serves on the authoritys board, said the city wanted to work with the agency to improve bus service.

I dont come to participate, she said. I come to kill it.   Credit Jonathan Ferrey/Getty Images     DAYTONA BEACH, Fla.  Danica Patrick is not a fan of average. Never was. The problem for Patrick is that in her fourth full season on Nascar s top circuit, that is just what she became most weeks: an also-ran. Patrick had no top-10 finishes last season, and has only six in 154 career starts. In a series that typically runs 40-car fields, Patricks average starting position last year was 25th. Her average finish was 22nd. Any way you slice it, that is average. And Patrick is the first to admit that is not good enough. Im not O.K. with trying, she said on Wednesday as she continued preparations for Sundays season-opening Daytona 500. I dont come to participate. Thats awful. I come to kill it. I come to show what I can do as a driver, because I believe in myself. The pressing question is how long sponsors and racing fans will continue to believe in Patrick, who will turn 35 next month. More than a few Nascar followers believe this is Patricks make-or-break season. They include Ricky Craven, the former driver and current ESPN analyst, who concedes that Patricks once wide window of opportunity may be closing.  Photo        Patrick has changed cars and engines this season, which many see as a make-or-break one for her.   Credit Jared C. Tilton/Getty Images    I feel like shes stalled in terms of progress, he said. Patrick, however, says she sees progress. She switched cars this season  from a Chevrolet SS to a Ford Fusion  and engines. The change in cars allows her more direct contact with a manufacturer for changes and adjustments, but it is the other switch, to Roush Yates Engines, that may make more of a difference.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   Last year, Patrick got her engines from Hendrick Motorsports. The problem was not one of quality, she said, but of competition: Hendrick oversaw a team in competition with Patricks team, Stewart-Haas Racing, an arrangement akin to a golfers having to use a rivals clubs.  Continue reading the main story         Advertisement   Continue reading the main story       Hendrick runs a professional operation, Patrick said. But still, how can you ever be sure that youre getting the best stuff? There is more potential now. Roush Yates provides engines for other teams, but they dont have their own team, she said. I went to the engine shop last week, and it was just cool to hear how, if we want to work on the bottom end more, or the top end, or certain elements of the performance of the engine, we can just ask. It might not seem like much, but in a sport often decided by inches and fractions of seconds, it can be the difference between top-tier finishes and average ones.

You think to yourself, Man, if my engine performed one-tenth faster on the lap, if my car was one-tenth better, where would two-tenths put me? Everything makes a difference, and there is not that much difference between everyone. Its possible the Roush Yates engine was the difference in Sundays 75-lap Advance Auto Parts Clash exhibition race, in which Patrick finished fourth. Though the result didnt earn her any points, it was the highest finish for a woman in a Nascar-sanctioned event at Daytona International Speedway. It was also the highest finish for Patricks SHR team. Now she wants more. To be fair, its not as if Patrick doesnt have some significant credits on her resume already. A former IndyCar series rookie of the year, Patrick posted her sole victory in that series in the 2008 Indy Japan 300. Should she win a Nascar race, she would join a short list of drivers who have won races in IndyCar and in Nascar. Having more control of her engine should help Patrick achieve that goal. At the same time, she knows that there will always be things beyond her control, obstacles that have held her back or, more recently, moved her toward the back of the pack. She still struggles because of her gender, she said, lamenting that lapped drivers sometimes still block her but then allow male drivers to pass. I dont like getting passed by a girl, so Im sure they dont, either, Patrick said. I get that. But Ive witnessed with my own eyes when somebody Im trying to get by, somebody in lap traffic, that theyre making my life a living hell. Then I watch them move over for someone else. And Im thinking, Oh, my god. This is what I deal with every single weekend.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   She sighed. The only thing I can do is tell myself that what doesnt kill me makes me stronger, she said. It makes me better in all situations. And that over time, they must get used to it. They will get used to it. And it will get easier.

The Haggler has, for a long time, tried to make it clear that this nitwit is not to be confused with the Haggler, but the message does not seem to be getting through. If anything, the nitwit  Hey Haggler. Can you stop with the insults, please? Ive been pretty patient with your attacks, which are completely gratuitous, for years. The nitwit speaks! Hey, how about if you zip it for the time being, hmmm? For, like, another five or six minutes. Because nobody comes to this space to listen to you. Seriously. They come for the Haggler. They come for consumer justice. Exactly! And the sooner you stop interrupting, the sooner well get to consumer justice.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   Wow. Deep breaths. You see, dear readers, what the Haggler puts up with? Its sad. But it wont deter the Haggler, who in this episode learns more than he needs to know about vintage cars.  Continue reading the main story         Advertisement   Continue reading the main story       Q. In May, I placed an ad on Craigslist to sell my 1969 Plymouth Road Runner, hoping to pocket at least $23,000. I was soon contacted by a rep at Dusty Old Cars, in Nashua, N.H., who said if I consigned the car to the company it would transport the vehicle to its premises, post photos on its website  which is viewed by buyers around the world  and net me as much as $35,000. Good deal, it seemed. We signed a contract, stipulating that I would be paid a minimum of $23,000. Or so I thought. In August, I was enraged to get a check from Dusty for a little more than $18,000. The company had accepted an offer of $23,000 from which it subtracted a 10 percent commission, a number of fees and nearly $2,000 in repairs. I maintain that the car was in fantastic shape  it had been almost completely refurbished  and these repairs were unnecessary. Im not sure you can get any of my money back, but maybe you could make sure others dont fall into the same trap.  Joseph Mastromarino, Derry, N.H. A. Mr. Mastromarino is one of dozens of unhappy Dusty Old Cars customers. The New Hampshire attorney generals office has a list of nearly 90 complaints about the company on its site , and James Boffetti, the states senior assistant attorney general, told the Haggler that the office is currently investigating the company. Customers were told time and again, We sold your car for $10,000 but we put $6,000 of repairs into it, Mr. Boffetti said on the telephone. So minus our commission, heres a check for $3,000. He added that some customers were not paid a cent for their vehicles. Anthony Marotto, for instance, told the Haggler that he was paid unsatisfactory amounts for six of the 10 cars he consigned to Dusty and a grand total of zilch for four of them. At least Mr. Marotto was never threatened with a lawsuit. That happened to Stephen Kelly, who received nada for the 1970 Cadillac DeVille that he had consigned to Dusty. After posting a complaint to a Better Business Bureau of New Hampshire website, he got a call from Dustys owner, Stephan Condodemetraky, who is heard in a TV news report about the matter, broadcast last year, issuing a warning on a voice mail message: You know, it took me about five minutes for me to locate you, sir. So its going to take about five minutes for my lawyer to locate you, too. And then were going to come after you personally. Thats after we file criminal charges with the police departments.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   The Haggler thinks it is time for readers to meet Mr. Condodemetraky, a highly voluble character with an affinity for long explanations and a deep love of jargon. (Instead of jalopy he prefers materially problematic asset.) But first a little heads-up. Do not expect this guy to retreat an inch. People are dishonest, he said during two surprisingly entertaining conversations last week. Mr. Condodemetraky said that Mr. Mastromarino, for instance, had completely misrepresented the state of his Road Runner, and that the repairs performed were required to sell the car for $23,000. Further, he said, those repairs were allowed under the terms of the contracts Mr. Mastromarino signed. As for Mr. Marotto and the four cars that didnt yield him a dime, expensive and needed repairs wiped out any profit that he might have expected, Mr. Condodemetraky said. Obvious question: Why not tell Mr. Marotto that he is going to wind up with nothing before the repairs or the sales occur? We told him at least three or four times, Mr. Condodemetraky said. Not only did we do that, we took him through the mechanical inspection of each asset. Untrue, said Mr. Marotto. Before he learned through the Haggler that the cars had been sold, he added, he had considered filing a stolen car report. What about the 89 complaints on the attorney generals website, the Haggler asked Mr. Condodemetraky. Weve done almost 6,000 transactions since we opened in 2011, he said. Lets say 5,500. Eighty-nine complaints is about 1.5 percent of all our customers. He wondered: Can The New York Times match that tiny ratio of satisfied to unsatisfied customers? The Haggler is in no position to say. But you get the picture. In Mr. Condodemetrakys view, every one of his critics is lying or mistaken, or both lying and mistaken. But the sheer number of those critics is taking a toll. Last week, Dusty Old Cars filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy, listing between $500,000 and $1 million in liabilities and naming 19 ex-customers in its list of creditors with the largest unsecured claims.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   Do you think this has led Mr. Condodemetraky to rethink his business model? Oh, you are adorable. We continue to operate, he said, with some pride. We consigned cars today and we sold cars today.   EMAIL: haggler@nytimes.com  or tweet to @TheHagglerNYT.

The system can be used to track people in the volatile Xinjiang region in far western China. Credit The New York Times By  Edward Wong Feb. 24, 2017  Officials in Chinas largest prefecture, in the far-western region of Xinjiang, are requiring all drivers there to install a Chinese-made satellite navigation system in their vehicles, according to an official news report this week. Police officials say drivers must install the navigation system by June 30. The installation rate will reach 100 percent, said a report on Monday on the website of The Korla Evening Post, a newspaper in the prefectures capital, Korla. The report was also posted on the government-managed website of Beidou , the Chinese satellite navigation system. Beidou is Chinas version of the Global Positioning System, or GPS. The new requirement is intended to help the authorities track people in a region where violence sometimes erupts because of ethnic tensions. Parts of Xinjiang are home to ethnic Uighurs, a Turkic-speaking people who mostly practice Sunni Islam and often resent policies made by the ethnic Han, the dominant group in China. The most notable burst of violence occurred in 2009, when ethnic rioting convulsed Urumqi , the regional capital, resulting in about 200 deaths, most of them ethnic Han, according to official reports. Officials responded with a harsh security crackdown. Other episodes have resembled domestic terrorism, and some officials say the attackers have connections to groups engaged in global jihadist activities, but they have not offered any evidence to buttress that claim. The prefecture, Bayingol Mongol Autonomous Prefecture, is next to Urumqi, and many vehicles that travel through it are going to or coming from Urumqi. Oasis towns with heavy Uighur populations lie to its west. The prefectures population is 32 percent Uighur and 59 percent Han, according to official statistics, even though the prefectures name implies that Mongolians are a significant population. (In fact, they are 3 percent of the total.) Last year, central Communist Party officials appointed Chen Quanguo as the new party chief of Xinjiang. Mr. Chen formerly oversaw the Tibet Autonomous Region, which also has chronic problems involving ethnic conflict. Mr. Chen has tried to roll out more hard-line policies. It seems likely that he hopes to get a seat this fall on the Politburo, a top governing body in the party. Nicholas Bequelin, the East Asia director for Amnesty International, said the requirement to install the navigation system was consistent with Xinjiangs important role as a trial ground for Chinas ambition to create a world-class, high-tech counterterrorism force. While preventing terrorist attacks is a legitimate concern for the government, Mr. Bequelin said, the kind of indiscriminate, quasi-totalitarian policies rolled out in Xinjiang under Mr. Chen are bound to create a deep pool of resentment that will indeed turn into a real time bomb for China. In 2014, a series of bomb blasts in the prefecture killed six people, according to an official report. Security forces then shot people whom the report described as rioters. Forty people died, including some who blew themselves up, the report said. In 2013, a Uighur farmer used a knife to kill at least five people and wound seven, according to an official report. News of the navigation system requirement first appeared in a post on the official microblog of the Bayingol traffic police department on Feb. 4. The post said: In recent years, the international antiterrorism situation has been grim. Cars are the main means of transport for terrorists and have become a frequently chosen tool in terrorist attacks. Another post said that on Feb. 19, police officers met to discuss the requirement. After that, a post appeared telling car owners about the order. Since then, all those posts have been deleted from the official microblog account, but cached versions were saved and are viewable online. In the past week and a half, officials in Xinjiang have ordered paramilitary units and police officers to hold large rallies in at least three cities with significant Uighur populations as demonstrations of force. A report on the official regional government website said the rally at a central square in Urumqi involved at least 10,000 security officers and hundreds of vehicles.
