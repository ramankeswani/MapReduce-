Credit Ramin Rahimian for The New York Times     SAN FRANCISCO  Several months before filing a lawsuit against Uber, Google demanded arbitration against the head of Ubers self-driving car unit, claiming that he used confidential salary information while trying to poach former colleagues to a new venture that he eventually sold to Uber. Googles previously undisclosed legal action against Anthony Levandowski, who is accused by Waymo of stealing corporate secrets when he worked there and taking them to Uber, came out in a motion filed by Ubers lawyers on Wednesday. Waymo, an autonomous car business, spun out into its own subsidiary of Googles parent company, Alphabet, in December. Mr. Levandowski is at the center of a high-powered legal dispute between Waymo and Uber. Waymo has said that Mr. Levandowski, who joined Uber six months after leaving Google, when the ride-hailing service bought his start-up Otto for $680 million in August, colluded with Uber to steal information about Waymos self-driving vehicle technology. Waymo filed a motion seeking a temporary injunction this month to stop Ubers driverless car development.

Arbitration is usually less expensive and proceeds faster than a federal lawsuit. It is not argued in front of a jury, and arbitration hearings are not part of the public record.  Continue reading the main story         Advertisement   Continue reading the main story       In Wednesdays motion, Uber said that Waymo filed two arbitration demands against Mr. Levandowski in October saying that he breached the confidentiality agreement in his employment contract with Google when he used confidential salary information to make targeted offers to Waymos employees to aid Uber and Otto. Similarly, he used that information to induce Waymo employees to join a competing driverless-car enterprise, according to court documents.

Waymo said Wednesday evening that it intended to oppose Ubers motion. Uber said it would move forward with its request for arbitration on the dispute with Waymo this week. The broad arbitration provisions in Levandowskis employment contracts require that disputes with anyone arising out of or related to Levandowskis employment must be arbitrated, wrote Arturo Gonzalez, Ubers layer. Uber is also asking an arbitrator to declare that Waymos accusations that Uber misappropriated trade secrets and competed unfairly are meritless. While Uber wants to arbitrate Waymos claims that Uber is using trade secrets and competed unfairly, the ride-hailing service said Waymos claims of patent infringement should move ahead in federal court.

A deal with SoftBank could help Didi Chuxing contend with a rash of difficulties.   Credit Alberto Estevez/European Pressphoto Agency     HONG KONG  Didi Chuxing, a company in China that last year bested Uber in that huge ride-sharing market, is in negotiations to get SoftBank of Japan to take part in a multibillion-dollar investment round, according to people familiar with the talks. Should a deal be reached, it could be the latest big bet that SoftBanks eccentric leader, Masayoshi Son, has placed on a significant technology company. Mr. Son has been raising $100 billion for what he calls the SoftBank Vision Fund and has already pledged to invest $50 billion and create 50,000 jobs in the United States. While it is unclear whether that fund is involved in the talks over Didi Chuxing, analysts say it could be further used to make sizable investments in big, global tech companies. A deal could also help Didi Chuxing, which counts Apple among its powerful backers , contend with a rash of difficulties. Since the company bought Ubers business in China in the summer to form a business valued at $35 billion, it has been mired in regulatory pressures . Still, executives at the company have said that they harbor international ambitions, and it is pushing aggressively to catch up in the development of driverless car technologies. A deal with SoftBank is also intended to increase Didi Chuxings value, said one of the people familiar with the talks.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   It is unclear whether Didi Chuxing will reach a deal with SoftBank and at what amount or whether it will involve other investors. The people familiar with the talks spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly about the discussions. Bloomberg earlier reported the talks on Tuesday.  Continue reading the main story         Advertisement   Continue reading the main story       The fund-raising efforts by Didi Chuxing show how foreign investors currently value dominance in China, an internet market largely closed to foreign competition that has the largest smartphone-using populace in the world. A new multibillion-dollar round would also put Didi roughly on par with the total funds raised by Uber. It has also raised money at home from the two biggest internet companies in China: Alibaba, an e-commerce giant, and Tencent, a games and social media conglomerate. Didi Chuxings longer-term expansion is likely to be closely watched as a touchstone of the prospects of Chinas homegrown internet champions. The company has a number of high-profile investors, both Chinese and foreign, and whether it develops important technology for autonomous cars or is able to expand into other markets will become a new barometer for the abilities of companies that have grown large in Chinas relatively isolated market.

Privacy Policy  Opt out or contact us anytime      Along with receiving a bigger valuation, analysts said Didi would most likely use the money to invest in next-generation technology, like autonomous vehicles, and potentially also on international expansion, though the company has so far done little outside its domestic market. Didi has been content to invest in and work with a band of similar ride-hailing companies in India, Southeast Asia and America. The partners include Ubers main rival in the United States, Lyft . It is uncertain whether Didi would consider introducing its own service to challenge those partners as part of an international push, look to other markets in developing countries or continue to invest in promising companies. Even so, the company has put money into recruiting foreign talent. In March, Didi said it was creating a research and development lab in Silicon Valley that is focused on developing artificial-intelligence technologies to help with security and driverless cars. It also said that it would use A.I. to aid it in the data analytics required to improve transportation in Chinas many traffic-snarled cities. As a part of the effort, the company poached Charlie Miller, a well-known computer scientist who once worked for Uber. Yet even as it speeds ahead with technology, Didi has faced a more prosaic challenge at home. New rules in China that have required drivers in some of the countrys biggest cities to have registration documents have pinched the companys ability to respond to customer demand. Regulations have had a direct impact on the supply of cars, said Xue Yu, a senior analyst at IDC, a market research firm. For customers, it will be a lot more difficult to order a car than before the new regulations were announced, Mr. Xue said. This has largely raised the operation costs for Didi.

Credit Jeff Swensen for The New York Times     Uber said on Saturday that it was suspending the testing of its self-driving vehicles, a day after one of the vehicles was involved in a collision in Tempe, Ariz. The Uber vehicle, which had a person in the drivers seat but was in self-driving mode, was not at fault in the accident, according to Josie Montenegro, a Tempe Police Department spokeswoman. Ubers Volvo XC90 sport utility vehicle was hit when the driver of another car failed to yield, she said. The collision caused Ubers vehicle to roll over onto its side. Ms. Montenegro and an Uber spokeswoman, Chelsea Kohler, confirmed the accident on Friday evening and said neither driver suffered serious injuries. We are continuing to look into this incident and can confirm we had no back-seat passengers in the vehicle, Ms. Kohler said in a statement.

She said Uber had also suspended testing in Pittsburgh and San Francisco for the day, and possibly longer.  Continue reading the main story         Advertisement   Continue reading the main story       The news of the accident was first reported by ABC-15 , an Arizona affiliate station. The incident comes at a difficult time for Uber, which for the last two months has fielded multiple crises involving the companys workplace culture and business practices. Earlier in March, The New York Times reported the existence of a tool called Greyball , which Uber engineers used to skirt authorities cracking down on Uber drivers worldwide. In addition, Travis Kalanick, Ubers chief executive, was forced to apologize for his aggressive behavior after Bloomberg published video of a verbal altercation he had with an Uber driver. Although Uber was not at fault in the Arizona accident, the incident is problematic for the company, a start-up based in San Francisco, which has gone head-to-head with regulators as it has tried to persuade cities to allow public testing of its autonomous vehicles. Google, General Motors and Ford Motor Company are all testing autonomous vehicles in California and have registered to do so.

The permits require companies to disclose the number of accidents their vehicles have been involved in. Shortly after the San Francisco testing began, one of Ubers self-driving cars failed to recognize a stoplight and sailed through a crosswalk . The car was driving itself at the time, according to internal documents reviewed by The Times. After the California Department of Motor Vehicles revoked the registrations for Ubers self-driving cars, the company took its vehicles to Arizona for testing , where the governor did not require the company to seek autonomous testing permits. Google, which has long tested self-driving vehicles in California, has also been in a number of accidents over the years. Typically, those accidents have been the fault of the other drivers. Auto companies working on self-driving technology face the difficulty of building smarter vehicles that must not only adhere to the rules of the road but must also account for the error-prone nature of human drivers, a far more difficult variable.

Credit Ramin Rahimian for The New York Times     The long-running rivalry between Uber and Google has taken many twists and turns. The two companies have been competing to hire talent and to race ahead of each other in technologies like driverless cars. Now, the latest fracas between the technology behemoths is heading into uncertain legal waters. It all began last month, when Googles sister company that focuses on self-driving cars, Waymo, sued Uber for using stolen intellectual property in its autonomous vehicles. Though the case could eventually end up going to trial, Uber made a push on Wednesday for parts of the lawsuit to be settled through arbitration, writes Daisuke Wakabayashi, a tech reporter for The New York Times. Specifically, Uber revealed in a new court document that Waymo previously pursued arbitration with Anthony Levandowski, who formerly worked on Googles self-driving cars and is now the head of Ubers autonomous car unit. According to the filing, Waymo went the arbitration route with Mr. Levandowski last October over its contention that he tried to hire Google employees by using confidential salary information from the company. Its unclear what the outcome of the arbitration was.  Newsletter Sign Up  Continue reading the main story  Interested in All Things Tech?

Credit Eric Risberg/Associated Press     SAN FRANCISCO  An Uber executive accused of stealing driverless car technology from his former employers at Google is exercising his Fifth Amendment right to avoid self-incrimination, according to his lawyers. The lawyers for Anthony Levandowski, the former head of Googles self-driving car project who is now leading a similar effort at Uber, said he was broadly asserting his Fifth Amendment rights because there was potential for criminal action in the case, according to court transcripts obtained on Thursday. The legal maneuver adds even more intrigue to the high-profile fight between two of the technology industrys largest companies, which are squaring off in the race to put driverless cars on the road. Mr. Levandowski is at the center of a lawsuit between Uber and Waymo , which was spun out from Google to become its own Alphabet subsidiary. Waymo has accused Mr. Levandowski of stealing documents and poaching employees before quitting Google and then colluding with Uber to use that technology to advance driverless car efforts at the ride-hailing service.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   Shortly after leaving Google, Mr. Levandowski started his own self-driving truck start-up, Otto. Six months after Otto was formed, Uber acquired the company for $680 million . Waymo filed a motion seeking a temporary injunction this month to stop Ubers autonomous vehicle development.  Continue reading the main story         Advertisement   Continue reading the main story       As part of the motion seeking the injunction, Waymo said that Mr. Levandowski, while still working at Google, installed software that allowed him to download over 14,000 files, or about 9.7 gigabytes of data, pertaining to the driverless car program. Uber was ordered to hand over those files. In the transcript of a private hearing before Judge William Alsup in United States District Court in San Francisco, Mr. Levandowskis lawyers said he was invoking his Fifth Amendment right to avoid self-incrimination in not turning over documents that may pertain to the case. Arturo Gonzalez, one of Ubers lawyers, said they have made clear to Mr. Levandowski that he needs to release any documents relevant to the case as part of discovery. We obviously have a conflict, he said. Miles Ehrlich, one of the lawyers representing Mr. Levandowski, said the Uber executive was asserting his Fifth Amendment rights to protect against compelled disclosure that would identify the existence, location or possession of any responsive documents. He also said that Mr. Levandowskis decision to invoke the Fifth Amendment may change as they examine the case.

When Ubers lawyer told the court that the company could not force him to testify, Judge Alsup said Uber had the right to order him to cooperate or be fired. Without arguing about whether or not Mr. Levandowski stole documents, Ubers lawyer said the company intended to prove that its driverless car technology was not stolen from Waymo. The more we get into this, it might look like a public relations disaster for Uber, said Michael Carrier, a law professor at Rutgers University. The mere fact that youre pleading the Fifth doesnt look good. The acquisition of Otto and the hiring of Mr. Levandowski was critical for Uber. It is betting that autonomous cars are essential to its future, allowing it to run a fleet of cars around the clock without having to pay drivers. Angela Padilla, Ubers associate general counsel, said in a statement that the company plans to publicly lay out its case on April 7. We are very confident that Waymos claims against Uber are baseless and that Anthony Levandowski has not used any files from Google in his work with Otto or Uber, she said. A Waymo spokesman declined to comment. Ubers lawyers tried to keep the hearing confidential, arguing that it could harm Mr. Levandowskis reputation. Judge Alsup dismissed that argument.

Automakers are the biggest users of industrial robots, which have decreased employment and wages in local economies.   Credit Bill Pugliano/Getty Images     Who is winning the race for jobs between robots and humans? Last year, two leading economists described a future in which humans come out ahead. But now theyve declared a different winner: the robots. The industry most affected by automation is manufacturing. For every robot per thousand workers, up to six workers lost their jobs and wages fell by as much as three-fourths of a percent, according to a new paper by the economists, Daron Acemoglu of M.I.T. and Pascual Restrepo of Boston University. It appears to be the first study to quantify large, direct, negative effects of robots. The paper is all the more significant because the researchers, whose work is highly regarded in their field, had been more sanguine about the effect of technology on jobs. In a paper last year , they said it was likely that increased automation would create new, better jobs, so employment and wages would eventually return to their previous levels. Just as cranes replaced dockworkers but created related jobs for engineers and financiers, the theory goes, new technology has created new jobs for software developers and data analysts. But that paper was a conceptual exercise. The new one uses real-world data  and suggests a more pessimistic future. The researchers said they were surprised to see very little employment increase in other occupations to offset the job losses in manufacturing. That increase could still happen, they said, but for now there are large numbers of people out of work, with no clear path forward  especially blue-collar men without college degrees.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   The conclusion is that even if overall employment and wages recover, there will be losers in the process, and its going to take a very long time for these communities to recover, Mr. Acemoglu said.  Continue reading the main story         Advertisement   Continue reading the main story       If youve worked in Detroit for 10 years, you dont have the skills to go into health care, he said. The market economy is not going to create the jobs by itself for these workers who are bearing the brunt of the change. The papers evidence of job displacement from technology contrasts with a comment from the Treasury secretary, Steve Mnuchin, who said at an Axios event last week that artificial intelligences displacement of human jobs was not even on our radar screen, and 50 to 100 more years away. (Not all robots use artificial intelligence, but a panel of experts  polled by the M.I.T. Initiative on the Digital Economy in reaction to Mr. Mnuchins comments  expressed the same broad concern of major job displacement.) The paper also helps explain a mystery that has been puzzling economists: why, if machines are replacing human workers, productivity hasnt been increasing. In manufacturing, productivity has been increasing more than elsewhere  and now we see evidence of it in the employment data, too. The study analyzed the effect of industrial robots in local labor markets in the United States. Robots are to blame for up to 670,000 lost manufacturing jobs between 1990 and 2007, it concluded, and that number will rise because industrial robots are expected to quadruple. The paper adds to the evidence that automation, more than other factors like trade and offshoring that President Trump campaigned on, has been the bigger long-term threat to blue-collar jobs. The researchers said the findings  large and robust negative effects of robots on employment and wages  remained strong even after controlling for imports, offshoring, software that displaces jobs, worker demographics and the type of industry.

The data doesnt explain why, but Mr. Acemoglu had a guess: Women are more willing than men to take a pay cut to work in a lower-status field. The economists looked at the effect of robots on local economies and also more broadly. In an isolated area, each robot per thousand workers decreased employment by 6.2 workers and wages by 0.7 percent. But nationally, the effects were smaller, because jobs were created in other places. Take Detroit, home to automakers, the biggest users of industrial robots. Employment was greatly affected. If automakers can charge less for cars because they employ fewer people, employment might increase elsewhere in the country, like at steel makers or taxi operators. Meanwhile, the people in Detroit will probably spend less at stores. Including these factors, each robot per thousand workers decreased employment by three workers and wages by 0.25 percent.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   The findings fuel the debate about whether technology will help people do their jobs more efficiently and create new ones, as it has in the past, or eventually displace humans. David Autor, a collaborator of Mr. Acemoglus at M.I.T., has argued that machines will complement instead of replace humans, and cannot replicate human traits like common sense and empathy. I dont think that this paper is the last word on its subject, but its an exceedingly carefully constructed and thought-provoking first word, he said. Mr. Restrepo said the problem might be that the new jobs created by technology are not in the places that are losing jobs, like the Rust Belt. I still believe there will be jobs in the years to come, though probably not as many as we have today, he said. But the data have made me worried about the communities directly exposed to robots. In addition to cars, industrial robots are used most in the manufacturing of electronics, metal products, plastics and chemicals. They do not require humans to operate, and do various tasks like welding, painting and packaging. From 1993 to 2007, the United States added one new industrial robot for every thousand workers  mostly in the Midwest, South and East  and Western Europe added 1.6.   The study, a National Bureau of Economic Research working paper published Monday, used data on the number of robots from the International Federation of Robotics (there is no consistent data on the monetary value of the robots in use.) It analyzed the effect of robots on employment and wages in commuting zones, a way to measure local economies. The next question is whether the coming wave of technologies  like machine learning, drones and driverless cars  will have similar effects, but on many more people.

Credit Tony Powell/Washington Life Magazine     WASHINGTON  On the fourth floor of the Eisenhower Executive Office Building, the staff of the White House chief technology officer has been virtually deleted, down from 24 members before the election to, by Friday, only one. Scores of departures by scientists and Silicon Valley technology experts who advised President Trumps predecessor have all but wiped out the larger White House Office of Science and Technology Policy. Mr. Trump has not yet named his top advisers on technology or science, and so far, has made just one hire: Michael Kratsios, the former chief of staff for Peter Thiel, the Silicon Valley investor and one of the presidents wealthiest supporters, as the deputy chief technology officer. Neither Mr. Kratsios, who has a bachelors degree in political science from Princeton, nor anyone else still working in the science and technology office regularly participates in Mr. Trumps daily briefings, as they did for President Barack Obama.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   The impression this leaves is that Trump isnt interested in science and that scientific matters are a low priority at the White House, said Vinton G. Cerf, a computer scientist, vice president of Google and one of the chief architects of the internet. The dwindling of the White House science and technology staff for scientific research could have long-term consequences, Mr. Cerf said.  Continue reading the main story         Advertisement   Continue reading the main story       It is unclear whether the vacancies are the result of the Trump administrations overall slowness in hiring or a signal that the president places less importance on science and technology than Mr. Obama did. A White House official who asked not to be identified cast the issue as one of timing: Mr. Trump, the official said, is still reviewing candidates to be his chief science adviser, considers the science and technology office important and will soon have a new staff for it. But critics see the empty offices as part of a devaluation of science throughout the Trump administration, including the reversal of Mr. Obamas climate change policies and proposals to sharply reduce spending for research on climate change, science and health. They note that Mr. Obama appointed his top science adviser, John P. Holdren, a Harvard physicist and climate-change expert, in December 2008, weeks before his inauguration.     Graphic  President Trumps 100 Days of Record-Low Approval Ratings  President Trump has the lowest job approval of any president since Gallup began tracking in 1953.         OPEN Graphic      At the same time, conservatives  including a member of Mr. Trumps transition team  have called for getting rid of the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy. (The chief technology officer is a part of that larger office.) They argue that the office, created by Congress in 1976, is a bloated bureaucracy that duplicates expertise already found at government agencies. Eliminating the O.S.T.P. (or at least electing not to staff it until Congress can act) would not block the president from access to science and technology advice, James Jay Carafano, who advised Mr. Trumps transition team, wrote in a report issued last summer by the conservative Heritage Foundation. Rather, it eliminates a formal office whose purpose is unclear and whose capabilities are largely redundant. Mr. Trump has echoed that sentiment, at least when it comes to government jobs over all. Last month he responded to criticism about the high number of vacancies across his administration by telling Fox News that a lot of those jobs, I dont want to appoint, because theyre unnecessary to have. You know, we have so many people in government, even me, Mr. Trump said. I look at some of the jobs and its people over people over people. I say, What do all these people do? You dont need all those jobs.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   If Mr. Trump applies that logic to the science and technology office, he will end decades of tradition in which the president increasingly relied on his own advisers for expertise on federal research budgets, emerging trends and technical crises. Mr. Trumps first budget proposes slashing $5.8 billion, or 18 percent, from the National Institutes of Health and $900 million, or about 20 percent, from the Energy Departments Office of Science, which runs basic research at the national laboratories. The Environmental Protection Agency would be cut by 31 percent. On Tuesday, Mr. Trump issued executive orders that roll back Mr. Obamas Clean Power Plan, which would have closed hundreds of coal-fired power plants in an effort to curb planet-warming carbon dioxide emissions. Those actions have been taken without advice or guidance from scientists and engineers inside the White House. The few remaining policy advisers have ceased distributing daily memos on policy issues like climate change, machine-learning regulation, or the ethics of big data collection. They are flying blind when it comes to science and tech issues, said Kumar Garg, who left the Office of Science and Technology Policy as a senior adviser after the election.

Bush administration, there were 50 people in the office, but Mr. Obama more than doubled the staff, to 130, and moved the office into a building on the White House grounds. Mr. Obama turned to the science office during crises like the 2014 Ebola outbreak in Africa; the 2011 nuclear spill in Fukushima, Japan ; and the Deepwater Horizon oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico in 2010. The staff of the science office developed the White Houses recommendations for regulation of commercial drones and driverless cars at the Transportation Department. Last year, the staff produced an attention-grabbing report that raised concerns about the threat that robots posed to employment and that advocated retraining Americans for higher-skilled jobs. The staff also put on the annual White House science fair.

The agenda was always huge in scope and ambition, and something was always happening, said Nicole Wong, a former deputy chief technology officer under Mr. Obama. The departure of science and technology experts from the White House means dozens of science and technology programs begun under Mr. Obama have gone untended in the weeks since Inauguration Day. The O.S.T.P. is the conduit for scientific perspective and scrutiny to the president and is a priority in White House decision making, said Danny Weitzner, a former deputy chief technology officer in the Obama administration and now the director of internet policy research at M.I.T. Under Mr. Obama, the science and technology office included 19 policy advisers in the environment and energy division, 14 in the national security and international affairs division, nine in the science division and 20 in the technology and innovation division.   We are all sitting on the edge of our seats hoping nothing catastrophic happens in the world, said Phil Larson, a former senior science and technology adviser to Mr. Obama. But if it does, who is going to be advising him? Current White House officials declined to say how many people remained in each division. But four former officials who recently left the office said that a wave of departures scheduled for Friday could potentially reduce the number of people left to a handful, not counting about eight administrative staff members.

BOUDETTE   MARCH 30, 2017      Continue reading the main story  Share This Page   Continue reading the main story            Photo        Emily Hurwitz, 28, an advertising executive who lives in San Francisco, with her 2012 Volkswagen Tiguan, which was recently purchased through Shift, a used-car online retailer.   Credit Peter DaSilva for The New York Times     Dennis McNabb had just started thinking about buying a roomier car last year when he suddenly had no choice. A heavy storm rolled across Texas and dropped golf-ball-size hail that pummeled his 2013 Hyundai Genesis and punched holes in the sedans windows. Another shock came when Mr. McNabb, a firefighter from San Antonio, saw the sticker prices of new cars. The Toyota 4Runner sport utility vehicle had caught his eye, but 2016 models were more than $40,000 when loaded up with the heated seats, touch screen and other options that he wanted. Mr. McNabb quickly found a solution: a used 2014 4Runner with 38,000 miles that cost him just $29,750 and came with a one-year warranty. The new ones are fairly expensive, and you lose about a third of the value as soon as you drive it off the lot, he said. The 2014 is pretty much fully loaded, and its practically the same car as the 2016, but way less. Kind of a no-brainer.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   Over the last several years, as the American economy has gained steam and consumers have rushed out to buy new cars, the average price of a new automobile has edged higher and higher. Last year, new vehicles on average sold for a record $34,077 , according to Edmunds.com, an auto-information website. Thats a 2.7 percent increase from 2015 and a 13 percent jump since 2011.  Continue reading the main story         Advertisement   Continue reading the main story       Thats also more than many consumers can or want to pay. The result is that used cars, especially the nearly new models that were leased or turned in by their original buyers, represent increasingly enticing deals. Its very hard to beat the value of a late-model used car, said Jessica Caldwell, a senior analyst at Edmunds.com . Depreciation is one of the biggest costs of owning a car, she noted. If you buy a used car with low mileage, someone else has already taken the depreciation hit, so its a very smart way to get a car. New-car prices are rising as automakers add more technology. Features like rear cameras, radar sensors, collision-preventing automatic braking systems and Bluetooth are now standard in most new cars and trucks. Americans preference for S.U.V.s and other larger vehicles is also pushing prices higher compared with the days when less expensive small cars were more in vogue. Consumers arent the only ones seeing opportunities in used vehicles. In Jackson, Mich., 80 miles west of Detroit, Wes Lutz has just built a 5,000-square-foot addition to his Chrysler Dodge Jeep franchise to accommodate his expanding used-car sales. Weve hired salespeople and managers because theres a lot of demand for used cars, Mr. Lutz said. If youre looking at a $33,000 price for new, you can get a similar car for half the price. Thats a great deal, especially for people who dont drive that much, or first-time car buyers. Mr. Lutz estimates that hell soon be selling 200 or more used cars a month, up from the 130 he typically sold per month last year. Other, bigger car dealers are making similar bets. AutoNation , a chain of 371 new-car franchises, is spending up to $500 million to set up a chain of used-only outlets. The first opens in Corpus Christi, Tex., in May. The company is also trying to take some of the anxiety out of buying used cars. Its new-car franchises now offer pre-owned models with uniform, no-haggle pricing, and promise to fix or disclose any recall issues a used car has.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   More people will look at used if theyve got peace of mind that youre getting a fair price, said Marc Cannon, AutoNation s vice president of marketing. Theres a lot of potential in the used business, and we think this is what consumers want.  Photo        A used-car lot in Reading, Pa. Americans bought 38.5 million used cars in 2016.   Credit Mark Makela for The New York Times    Americans purchased 38.5 million used cars in 2016, about the same as in 2015. That includes all used cars, from 20-year-old rust buckets to former demonstration models that dealers sell as used even though they may have fewer than 100 miles on the odometer. Sales of certified pre-owned cars rose 4 percent from 2015, to a record 2.6 million vehicles in 2016, according to Edmunds.com. Those are cars that are less than three years old, generally have under 50,000 miles, and have been inspected and serviced by a franchise dealer. They usually come with an extension to the original warranty. Thats the type of deal Mr. McNabb got on his 4Runner. Like new-car prices, used prices have also been rising, to an average of $19,189 in 2016, according to Edmunds.com. But analysts think used prices will ease because inventories are rising. This year, about 3.5 million cars that were leased for two or three years will be returned and sold as gently used cars, Ms. Caldwell, the Edmunds.com analyst, said. One caveat about buying pre-owned cars is that they are usually not subject to the rebates and discounts manufacturers typically offer on new cars. Also, even cars that are only a year or two old may not have the latest technology. So it pays to shop carefully. Joe Codiroli, a Defense Department consultant in Richmond, Va., discovered that last month when he looked for a bargain on a slightly used Subaru Forester . He wanted to get a model with EyeSight, Subarus safety electronics system, which includes advanced cruise control with automatic braking and blind-spot warning technology. The used Foresters he found didnt have those features. On top of that, he found that Subaru was offering zero-percent financing on the 2017 Forester. He picked out a reddish one  a color Subaru calls Venetian pearl. It came down to a few thousand dollars difference between new and used, Mr. Codiroli said. So the value for the extra features and the zero-percent swayed me to go with new. And hes glad he opted for the latest safety electronics. If a car cuts in front of me on the highway, it just slows down nice and easy, he said. Its phenomenal. Its easier to drive, and I feel a lot safer.
