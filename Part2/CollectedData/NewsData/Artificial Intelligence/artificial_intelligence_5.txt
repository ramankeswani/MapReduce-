When Uber bought Otto, Mr. Levandowski became Ubers vice president in charge of its self-driving car project.   Credit Ramin Rahimian for The New York Times     SAN FRANCISCO  Late last year, Uber, in defiance of California state regulators, went ahead with a self-driving car experiment on the streets of San Francisco under the leadership of Anthony Levandowski, a new company executive. The experiment quickly ran into problems. In one case, an autonomous Volvo zoomed through a red light on a busy street in front of the citys Museum of Modern Art. Uber, a ride-hailing service, said the incident was because of human error. This is why we believe so much in making the roads safer by building self-driving Ubers, Chelsea Kohler, a company spokeswoman, said in December. But even though Uber said it had suspended an employee riding in the Volvo, the self-driving car was, in fact, driving itself when it barreled through the red light, according to two Uber employees, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they signed nondisclosure agreements with the company, and internal Uber documents viewed by The New York Times. All told, the mapping programs used by Ubers cars failed to recognize six traffic lights in the San Francisco area. In this case, the car went through a red light, the documents said.    Video by Charles Rotter   The description of the traffic violation reflects Ubers aggressiveness in its efforts around self-driving cars and the ambition of its project leader, Mr. Levandowski, who is now at the center of a lawsuit brought against Uber by Waymo , an autonomous car business. Waymo is Googles cousin company under their parent entity, Alphabet .

Continue reading the main story         Advertisement   Continue reading the main story       After leaving Google in January 2016, Mr. Levandowski formed the self-driving truck company Otto. About six months later, Uber bought Otto for $680 million, and Mr. Levandowski became Ubers vice president in charge of its self-driving car project. Waymo filed a lawsuit on Thursday in federal court against Uber and Otto, accusing Mr. Levandowski and Uber of planning to steal trade secrets. The suit said Mr. Levandowski retrieved information from a highly confidential server with designs of crucial technologies used in its autonomous vehicles in the month before he resigned from Google, where he had spent nine years working on maps and self-driving cars.     Graphic  The Race for Self-Driving Cars  There are increasing signs that autonomous cars have arrived  and may be driving on our city streets sooner than we think.         OPEN Graphic      Alphabet and Uber view autonomous vehicles as using critical technology that may upend the automobile industry. Google started working on driverless cars around the time when Uber was formed, and Google is eager to prove that, despite its size and past successes, it can still innovate like a start-up. And replacing human drivers with self-driving cars would allow Uber to theoretically provide safer rides around the clock. Robot cars would also allow the ride-hailing service to avoid one of its biggest headaches  its drivers. Theres an urgency to our mission about being part of the future, Travis Kalanick, Ubers chief executive, said in an interview in August after announcing Ottos acquisition. This is not a side project. This is existential for us. Engineers like Mr. Levandowski are part of a limited pool of people with the experience and capability to lead efforts on self-driving cars. They are wooed by traditional automakers looking to acquire new technical talent and tech companies, both established firms and start-ups, who see the opportunity to use artificial intelligence and sensors to disrupt another industry. Whats in these peoples heads is hugely in demand, because the talent pool just doesnt have enough miles under the wheels, said Martha Josephson, a partner in the Palo Alto, Calif., office of Egon Zehnder, an executive recruiting firm.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   In fact, Sebastian Thrun, who founded Googles self-driving car project and is now the chief executive of the online teaching start-up Udacity, said last year that the going rate for driverless car engineering talent was about $10 million a person. Current and former co-workers of Mr. Levandowski, who asked for anonymity because they did not have permission to speak to reporters, said he was aggressive and determined with an entrepreneurial streak. Since leaving Google, Mr. Levandowski, 36, has embodied the Silicon Valley ethos that it is better to ask for forgiveness rather than permission.

But in an internal email to Uber employees obtained by The New York Times, Mr. Levandowski said that Otto did not steal any of Googles intellectual property, and that self-driving technology has been his lifes passion, having worked on it since his college days. He alluded to sharing more information with employees when he could in the future. A Waymo spokesman declined to comment on whether the company would refer its claims to law enforcement.     5 Things That Give Self-Driving Cars Headaches  Despite their multitude of sensors and processors, autonomous cars have a lot of trouble with some everyday aspects of driving.             Mr. Levandowski first gained renown as a graduate student at the University of California, Berkeley, in 2004, when he designed a riderless motorcycle that was entered in the Pentagons first contest for autonomous vehicles. A profile in The New Yorker, published in 2013 , said Mr. Levandowski grew so focused on overcoming the bikes technical hurdles that he offered $5,000 to the girlfriend of a team member, who Mr. Levandowski felt was being distracted, to end the relationship. He joined Google in 2007 as part of its Maps team and helped to build the companys Street View product. When Google gave the green light to begin working on a self-driving car in 2009, Mr. Thrun picked Mr. Levandowski for the original team. Mr. Levandowski gained some notoriety within Google for selling start-ups, which he had done as side projects, to his employer. In his biography for a real estate firm, for which he is a board member, Mr. Levandowski said he sold three automation and robotics start-ups to Google, including 510 Systems and Anthonys Robots, for nearly $500 million. After this story was published, the real estate firm updated its website erasing Mr. Levandowskis biography and said that it had erroneously reported certain facts incorrectly without Mr. Levandowskis knowledge.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   During Mr. Levandowskis time on Googles self-driving car project, the companys advances pushed autonomous vehicles out of the realm of science fiction. By late 2016, nearly 60 of Googles self-driving cars had driven more than two million miles on the road in four different states. But according to former co-workers, Mr. Levandowski became frustrated with the pace of progress at Google, worrying that the company was squandering its technical advantage by not moving fast enough. When Otto was unveiled in May, it showcased a flashy video of one of its trucks on a haul through the Nevada desert. The star of the show was the drivers seat, completely empty, as the truck drove itself down the highway. But that test drive was carried out without the proper permits and against the will of the Nevada Department of Motor Vehicles, a move that the agency eventually called illegal. When Uber bought Otto, Mr. Levandowski found a kindred spirit in Mr. Kalanick, who is also known for pushing the rules. In an interview with Bloomberg Businessweek in August 2016, Mr. Kalanick said they were brothers from another mother. After one week of testing in San Francisco last year, Uber backed down from its fight with California regulators and announced it was pulling its self-driving Volvos out of the city after the states D.M.V. revoked the registrations of the vehicles. When asked on Friday about the incident with the red traffic light, Ms. Kohler, the Uber spokeswoman, said in a statement: Our self-driving technology required human intervention. The vehicle operator had time to intervene, but failed to take over before crossing the stop line and manually proceeded through the protected crosswalk. In December, Uber said it remained 100 percent committed to eventually bringing autonomous vehicles to California. Nonetheless, the company loaded its Volvos onto a flatbed truck, and took them to Tempe, Ariz., a city more friendly to testing self-driving vehicles. In bold black letters stamped across the trucks white cab was the name of the truck operator: Otto .   Correction: March 1, 2017   An article on Saturday about talent in the driverless technology field referred incorrectly to comments by Anthony Levandowski, a former Google engineer who started the self-driving truck company Otto, which was bought by Uber and is at the center of a lawsuit by another autonomous car business, the Google affiliate Waymo. The statement, denying that Otto stole any of Googles intellectual property, was paraphrased from an internal company email; it was not a direct quotation from Mr. Levandowski.

Der Spiegel said that it saw a list that indicated that the German intelligence service, the BND, had monitored at least 50 phone numbers, fax numbers and email addresses beginning in 1999. One number was listed for The New York Times in Afghanistan. Others monitored by the BND included Reuters offices in Afghanistan, Pakistan and Nigeria, as well as the BBC World Service in London, Der Spiegel reported. The surveillance targets also included The Daily News of Zimbabwe, unnamed news agencies in Kuwait, Lebanon and India, and journalists organizations in Nepal and Indonesia, the article said.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   The only journalist identified by name as having been monitored was Arnaud Zajtman, 44, a Belgian journalist who Der Spiegel said had worked for almost 20 years in Africa, including a decade in Kinshasa, the Democratic Republic of Congo.  Continue reading the main story         Advertisement   Continue reading the main story       The German newsmagazine said it had contacted Mr. Zajtman and told him that it appeared that the BND had noted the telephone numbers of two of his Congolese contacts. Mr. Zajtman told Der Spiegel that it was not a good feeling to know that highly sensitive sources might have been monitored. Martin Knobbe, one of three reporters who wrote the article, confirmed that the newsmagazine had seen the BND list of connections, but said it did not have it in its possession.

He said the BND list mostly contained numbers and addresses that appeared to be several years old. He declined to specify the circumstances under which Der Spiegel viewed the document. The BND routinely declines to comment on its activities, and Der Spiegel said it had received the standard reply that the intelligence service was obliged to explain its actions only to the German government or relevant bodies of Parliament. Der Spiegel noted that the activities of the BND had come under scrutiny during a three-year parliamentary investigation of allegations that the intelligence services of the United States had conducted mass surveillance outside the United States. Those accusations were initially made by Edward J. Snowden, a former C.I.A. employee and National Security Agency contractor, who leaked top-secret documents in 2013 that exposed the extent of the N.S.A.s classified cybersecurity program. Those allegations stirred strong reactions in Germany, where citizens remember the state surveillance of the Nazi and Communist years. The controversy reached its height when it was revealed in fall 2013 that the United States had monitored a cellphone used by Chancellor Angela Merkel . Ms. Merkel testified before the parliamentary panel for seven hours this month, but no new details emerged about the N.S.A. activity or the BND links to the American services disclosed earlier during the inquiry. The panel is expected to deliver its final report this summer.

Credit Fazry Ismail/European Pressphoto Agency     SEOUL, South Korea  Officials from North Korea s secret police and Foreign Ministry were involved in the killing of the estranged half brother of the countrys leader, South Korean intelligence officials told lawmakers on Monday. Ever since Kim Jong-nam , the eldest brother of the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un , was first reported assassinated, the South Korean government has held the North responsible. On Monday, the National Intelligence Service in Seoul provided more details of what it described as state-sponsored terrorism, saying that four of the eight North Koreans identified as suspects by the Malaysian authorities were agents from North Koreas Ministry of State Security, the countrys secret police. Speaking on Monday in a closed-door parliamentary hearing, Lee Byung-ho, the director of the National Intelligence Service, said that two other suspects worked for the North Korean Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The remaining two were affiliated with Air Koryo , the Norths state-run airline company, and Singwang Economics and Trading General Corporation, Mr. Lee said, according to two lawmakers who attended the briefing. Singwang is among North Korean companies facing United Nations sanctions. The Malaysian authorities have said that Mr. Kim was killed by an extremely toxic nerve agent known as VX . They said that the North Koreans had hired and trained two women, one from Indonesia, the other from Vietnam, to attack Mr. Kim at Kuala Lumpur International Airport. The women smeared his face with the chemical while he was waiting to check in for a flight to Macau, where he and his family had a home, they said.

Mr. Lee, the South Korean intelligence chief, was quoted by the lawmakers as saying that the eight North Koreans, working as two four-member teams, converged in Kuala Lumpur to carry out the Feb. 13 assassination.

The four North Koreans who made up the assassination team left Malaysia the same day Mr. Kim was killed and are believed to be back in their country, Mr. Lee was quoted as saying.

Mr. Hyon worked for the Ministry of State Security, he said. Mr. Hyon and the Air Koryo employee, Kim Uk-il, remain at the embassy in Malaysia. A third member of the support team, identified as Ri Jong-chol, has been arrested in Kuala Lumpur. The fourth, identified as Ri Ji-u, is believed to be at large in Malaysia. North Koreas Ministry of State Security specializes in ferreting out people whose loyalty to Kim Jong-uns totalitarian regime is in doubt. Mr. Kim is believed to have used the ministry in the arrests and executions of senior officials, including an uncle, Jang Song-thaek , who was executed on charges of corruption and sedition in 2013. The ministry also runs a network of prison camps. During the intelligence briefing on Monday, Mr. Lee told the lawmakers that five senior officials affiliated with the State Security Ministry had been executed with antiaircraft guns. He also said that Gen. Kim Won-hong , who was removed as chief of the secret police in January, was in detention as part of a purge. Mr. Lee said that General Kim and his five deputies had angered Kim Jong-un by filing false reports, but he did not elaborate. The Souths intelligence agency had said earlier that General Kim was dismissed on charges of corruption and abuse of power. He was the latest in a series of high-ranking party and military officials that Kim Jong-un has fired, demoted or executed in efforts to consolidate his power through what South Korean officials have called a reign of terror.

The FBI is totally unable to stop the national security leakers that have permeated our government for a long time, he said on Twitter.   Credit Doug Mills/The New York Times     WASHINGTON  President Trump on Friday assailed the F.B.I. as a dangerously porous agency, charging that leaks of classified information from within its ranks were putting the country at risk  and calling for an immediate hunt for the leakers. Mr. Trumps complaints were his latest attacks on his own governments law enforcement and intelligence agencies, which he has characterized as misguided, irresponsible and politically motivated. The criticisms appeared to be a response to a news report Thursday night indicating that a White House official had asked the F.B.I. to rebut an article detailing contacts between Mr. Trumps associates and Russian intelligence officials. The report on Thursday night by CNN asserted that a White House official had called top leaders at the F.B.I. to request that they contact reporters to dispute the account, which appeared last week in The New York Times. Sean Spicer, the White House press secretary, told reporters on Friday morning that the CNN report was indefensible and inaccurate, and he has also called the Times article untrue. But on Friday morning, Mr. Trumps focus was on which members of his administration were sharing unflattering information about him with reporters, and his desire to find the perpetrators.   The FBI is totally unable to stop the national security "leakers" that have permeated our government for a long time. They can't even......

        Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) Feb. 24, 2017     Mr. Spicer argued on Friday that CNN had misreported a series of exchanges between Reince Priebus, the White House chief of staff, and leaders of the F.B.I. in the wake of the Times report.

Mr. Priebus did that in an interview on Sunday. The F.B.I. on Friday declined to provide its account of those conversations and declined to comment on Mr. Trumps Twitter statements. The executive editor of The Times, Dean Baquet, said on Friday that The Times had numerous sources confirming this story. Attacking it does not make it less true, Mr. Baquet said. An F.B.I. official confirmed on Thursday night that the White House had asked last week for the bureaus help disputing the story, and that senior F.B.I. officials had rejected the request, citing the continuing investigation into Russian efforts to affect the election. The official declined to say whether White House officials had reached out directly to Mr. Comey, Mr. McCabe or others. The official said the White House had reached out to American intelligence agencies in the hopes of enlisting their help. Tension between the F.B.I. and the White House is not unheard-of. President Bill Clinton had an icy relationship with his F.B.I. director, Louis J. Freeh, whose agents investigated the president and his associates for years. But it is very unusual for a president to openly criticize the entire bureau.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   Mr. Trumps remarks add to an already unusual moment in history for the F.B.I. The bureau, along with other American intelligence agencies, has concluded that Russia unleashed a hacking campaign to disrupt the 2016 presidential election, in part to help Mr. Trump. F.B.I. agents are also investigating some of Mr. Trumps former campaign advisers and associates. Mr. Trump has been disparaging the intelligence community for months, particularly in response to its conclusion that Russia sought to influence the election on his behalf. In December, he suggested that United States intelligence agencies could not be trusted because they erroneously concluded that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction in Iraq. In January, he denounced leaks emanating from the intelligence community and argued that they were politically motivated.  Are we living in Nazi Germany?  he said.   Michael S.

Apology here .  Update : Searle, not Seattle. Damn spellcheck (or maybe the AI was making a Microsoft joke?)  Izabella Kaminska has a thought-provoking piece on the real effects of technology on wages, in which she argues that much recent innovation, instead of displacing manual workers, has displaced high-paying skilled jobs. As it happens, I sort of predicted this 20 years ago, in a piece written for the Times magazines 100th anniversary (authors were asked to write as if it was 2096, and they were looking back.)  I argued then that menial work dealing with the physical world  gardeners, maids, nurses  would survive even as quite a few jobs that used to require college disappeared. As it turns out, big data has led to more progress in something that looks like artificial intelligence than I expected  self-driving cars are much closer to reality than I would have thought, and maybe gardening robots and post-Roomba robot cleaners will follow. Still, the point about the relative displacement of cognitive versus manual jobs seems to stand.  An aside: given the way Google Translate and such work, Seattles Searles Chinese Room Argument doesnt look as foolish as I used to think it was.  Anyway, Kaminskas point about the disruptiveness of such technological change is something we should take seriously. After all, it has happened before. The initial effect of the Industrial Revolution was a substantial de-skilling of goods production. The Luddites were, for the most part, not proletarians but skilled craftsmen, weavers who constituted s sort of labor aristocracy but found their skills devalued by the power loom. In the long run industrialization did lead to higher wages for everyone, but the long run took several generations to happen  in that long run we really were all dead.  So interesting stuff. Id note, however, that it remains peculiar how were simultaneously worrying that robots will take all our jobs and bemoaning the stalling out of productivity growth.

Credit Jeff Swensen for The New York Times     SAN FRANCISCO  Waymo, the self-driving car business spun out of Googles parent company, claimed in a federal lawsuit on Thursday that Uber was using intellectual property stolen by one of Googles former project leaders. In a federal court filing in San Francisco, Waymo said Anthony Levandowski, who runs Ubers autonomous car division, downloaded 14,000 files from Google a month before leaving to start his own self-driving car company, Otto. Uber acquired Otto in August for $680 million, about seven months after Mr. Levandowski left Google. Otto and Uber have taken Waymos intellectual property so that they could avoid incurring the risk, time, and expense of independently developing their own technology, the company said in the filing. Ultimately, this calculated theft reportedly netted Otto employees over half a billion dollars and allowed Uber to revive a stalled program, all at Waymos expense. Uber did not respond to requests for comment. In its filing, Waymo said it was inadvertently copied on an email from one of its suppliers with drawings of Ubers circuit board design for its lidar technology, short for light detection and ranging,  that are laser-based sensors used in self-driving cars. Waymo said Ubers design bore a striking resemblance to its proprietary and highly secret design and infringed on Waymos patents.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   Waymo also said that a number of Google employees, who subsequently left to join Mr. Levandowski at Otto, downloaded additional trade secrets before departing. These included supplier lists, manufacturing details and technical information, Waymo said.  Photo        Anthony Levandowski, left, and Lior Ron, who founded Otto, at the companys offices in San Francisco in 2016.    The suit accuses Uber of stealing trade secrets, infringing on patents and competing unfairly in an effort to catch up on autonomous vehicle technology.  Continue reading the main story         Advertisement   Continue reading the main story       Otto was the brainchild of a handful of former Google employees who pioneered autonomous vehicle research at the search giant. Mr. Levandowski, who had been at Google nine years, led that effort. He is a prominent figure in the world of self-driving vehicles, having worked on the technology for more than a decade and achieving some degree of renown as a graduate student at the University of California, Berkeley, in 2004, when he designed a self-driving motorcycle that was entered in the Pentagons first contest for autonomous vehicles. Later, when Google began working on self-driving cars, it acquired Mr. Levandowskis start-up, 510 Systems. Mr. Levandowski left Google in early 2016 to found Otto with Lior Ron , who also was experienced in autonomous vehicle research and digital mapping. Waymo noted in its suit that the sale to Uber closed shortly after Mr. Levandowski received his final multimillion dollar compensation payment from Google. Companies in Silicon Valley and Detroit are betting big on self-driving car technology. And the intense interest has spawned a string of expensive investments and lawsuits. Last year, General Motors paid more than $1 billion for Cruise Automation, an autonomous vehicle technology start-up, and Ford recently announced plans to invest $1 billion over five years in Argo AI, an artificial intelligence start-up formed in December.          OPEN Document    Document: Waymos Complaint Against Uber    In January, Tesla filed a lawsuit against Sterling Anderson, a former director of the companys Autopilot program, saying that he broke his employment contract by trying to recruit Tesla employees to join a new self-driving car company. Teslas suit, filed against Mr. Anderson and his partner Chris Urmson, a former Google employee, also claims that Mr. Anderson took proprietary information and tried to cover his tracks by destroying information.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   In December, Googles parent company, Alphabet , said that its seven-year-old autonomous vehicle project was spinning off from its research lab X and would operate as a stand-alone company called Waymo. Alphabet said its decision to spin out Waymo was a signal that the company thought its self-driving technology had advanced beyond research project status and was ready for commercialization. Waymo executives have said it is open to using the technology in many ways, including a ride-hailing service to compete with Uber.

Mr. Levandowski was named vice president of Ubers self-driving technology, and he reports directly to Travis Kalanick, the companys chief executive. Mr. Levandowski leads Ubers Advanced Technologies Center in Pittsburgh, the epicenter of the companys testing and self-driving efforts. Uber has said it could be years before self-driving vehicles enter wide mainstream use. But the company has already deployed early tests in Pittsburgh and Tempe, Ariz ., where the public can travel in prototype vehicles. In Fort Collins, Colo., Otto recently completed its first self-driving truck delivery, a 120-mile beer delivery for Budweiser. Uber has also struck a deal with Volvo to jointly develop a self-driving vehicle, the XC-90; early versions of it have been released in some cities.     Graphic  The Race for Self-Driving Cars  There are increasing signs that autonomous cars have arrived  and may be driving on our city streets sooner than we think.         OPEN Graphic      In December, Uber ran into opposition to a test of its self-driving Volvo XC-90s in San Francisco, an operation the California Department of Motor Vehicles said was illegal because Uber did not hold the proper permits . One week later, Uber relented, redirecting its test to Tempe and pulling a fleet of its self-driving cars out of the Bay Area. Uber, now privately valued at nearly $70 billion, has raised a dizzying amount of money from venture capitalists around Silicon Valley. One of its early investors was GV, the venture capital arm of Alphabet. In August, David Drummond, a longtime Alphabet executive who was instrumental in GVs $250 million investment in Uber in 2013, stepped down from his seat on Ubers board of directors as it became increasingly clear the two companies were on a collision course. It has been a difficult week for Uber. The company is still reeling from a blog post written by Susan Fowler , a former Uber employee, who claimed she was sexually harassed by a manager at the company and was ignored when she complained to the human resources department. The company said it was investigating Ms. Fowlers claims and other concerns about a toxic workplace culture . Mitch and Freada Kapor, early investors in Uber, wrote in a blog post on Thursday that they are frustrated with the companys inability to change its culture, despite their attempts to help. They also expressed concern about the independence of the investigation, which will be led by Eric H. Holder Jr., the former United States attorney general, and Arianna Huffington, an Uber board member. Mr. Holder has been paid to work on behalf of Uber since at least 2016, they wrote, and Ms. Huffingtons board seat also compromises her independence.

Watch in Times Video          embed            BEIRUT, Lebanon  Attacks on two Syrian security offices in the central city of Homs on Saturday killed more than 30 people, including a senior official who ran the feared military intelligence services, state media and officials reported. An insurgent coalition linked to Al Qaeda and known as the Levant Liberation Committee claimed responsibility for the attacks, which left another high-ranking officer seriously wounded. In a statement on its channel on the messaging app Telegram, the group said five attackers had stormed the two security offices. The group said bombs were detonated at checkpoints outside the buildings just as rescuers arrived, leading to more casualties. The governor of Homs Province, Talal Barzani, said there were three blasts and that they killed more than 32 people. He said the attackers wore explosives and detonated them in the security offices.

The differing casualty estimates could not be immediately reconciled. Such discrepancies are not uncommon in the immediate aftermath of violence in Syria. Homs is one of Syrias largest cities and is largely under government control. The attacks are among the most spectacular against security agencies in the six-year-old conflict  a coordinated operation against two heavily secured government buildings using a combination of armed assaults and suicide bombings. In the early days of the conflict, bombings directed against state security institutions were frequent, usually against military intelligence branches in Damascus and other cities. One such attack took place in July 2012, when insurgents detonated explosives inside a high-level crisis meeting in Damascus, killing four top government officials, including the defense minister and the brother-in-law of President Bashar al-Assad. The Syrian security forces run a vast intelligence network that operates independently of the military and with little judicial oversight. Human rights groups and Syria monitors say the various branches are responsible for many crimes committed during the conflict, including torture, extrajudicial killings and the shootings of protesters. In a February report, the human rights group Amnesty International reported that 5,000 to 13,000 people were killed in mass hangings in the militarys Saydnaya prison in Damascus between 2011 and 2015. It said the detainees were sent to the prison from around the country by the states four main security branches, including the military intelligence.

The nominee, Philip Bilden, a former military intelligence officer who ran the Hong Kong branch of a private equity firm, said in a statement that he had informed Defense Secretary Jim Mattis that he did not want to continue to seek confirmation a month after he had been named for the post. It was the latest case in which wealthy businesspeople whom Mr. Trump has favored for government jobs have been tripped up by the demands of avoiding conflicts of interest. On Feb. 3, Vincent Viola, a billionaire Wall Street trader and Mr. Trumps choice for secretary of the Army, withdrew because he decided it was too difficult to detach himself from his business interests. Mr. Bilden said in a statement that he fully supported the presidents agenda. But he added, After an extensive review process, I have determined that I will not be able to satisfy the Office of Government Ethics requirements without undue disruption and materially adverse divestment of my familys private financial interests. He did not elaborate.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   CBS News reported on Feb. 18 that Mr. Bilden was likely to withdraw his nomination, but Trump administration officials denied it. Sean Spicer, the White House press secretary, said on Twitter that CBSs sources were wrong.

Mr. Bilden, the son of a naval officer, attended Georgetown University on an R.O.T.C. scholarship and served from 1986 to 1996 in the Army Reserve as an intelligence officer. He was a board member of the Naval Academy Foundation and the Naval War College Foundation and has two sons who attended the Naval Academy. He was reported to be Mr. Mattiss choice for the position. He made his fortune in a 25-year career at HarbourVest Partners, first in Boston and then in Hong Kong. Mr. Mattis said that in the coming days he would recommend a new Navy secretary candidate.

Kennedy Airport in February.   Credit Hiroko Masuike/The New York Times     When President Trump signed an executive order last month temporarily barring visitors from seven mostly Muslim countries, he said he was moving to protect the United States from terrorist attacks. The Homeland Security secretary, John F. Kelly, echoed the president, saying the travel ban was necessary because vetting procedures in those seven countries are suspect. But an internal report written by intelligence analysts at Mr. Kellys department appears to undercut the assessment that people from the seven countries  Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen  pose a heightened threat of terrorism. The three-page report found that country of citizenship is unlikely to be a reliable indicator of potential terrorist activity. The report adds to the difficulties the Trump administration has faced in carrying out the travel ban. Federal judges have suspended the order, and the administration has said it will redo it to withstand legal scrutiny, but has not given a timetable. The Department of Homeland Security assessment, first reported by The Associated Press, found that only a small number of people from the seven countries had been involved in terrorism-related activities in the United States since the Syrian civil war began in 2011. In addition, the report noted, while terrorist groups in Iraq, Syria and Yemen pose a threat to the United States, militant groups in the other four countries have a more regional focus.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   The report also found that in the past six years, the terrorism threat reached much more widely than the seven countries listed  individuals from 26 countries had been inspired to carry out attacks in the United States.  Continue reading the main story         Advertisement   Continue reading the main story       Furthermore, few individuals from the seven countries affected by the ban have access to the United States, the report said, noting the small numbers of visas granted by the State Department to citizens of those nations.

The White House said that it was politically motivated and disregarded information that would have provided support for the travel ban. The Department of Homeland Security said the report was just a draft and not a final comprehensive review of the governments intelligence. Stephen Miller, a senior aide to Mr. Trump, told Fox News on Tuesday that the redrawn executive order would have the same basic policy outcome. The Trump administration on Friday also took the first steps toward following through on the presidents plan to build a wall along the border with Mexico. Customs and Border Protection, an agency within the Department of Homeland Security, announced that it would begin accepting design proposals for a wall. The agency said it would need the proposals by March 10. After it chooses a list of potential vendors, full proposals would be required a few weeks later. The agency said it could make a final decision by the middle of April.

Denzel Washington and Viola Davis starred in the 2010 Broadway revival of August Wilsons drama and took home Tonys. In this film adaptation, directed by Mr. Washington, theyve reprised the roles and earned Oscar nominations. Mr. Washington, in what A. O. Scott of The New York Times called a verbal performance of unmatched force and nuance, plays Troy Maxon, an embittered Negro League baseball player turned trash collector in 1957 Pittsburgh who refuses to allow his son to accept a college football scholarship. Ms. Davis is his wife, Rose, a plain-spoken foil to her husbands grandiloquence  and the one left to smooth over the damage he does to his relationships, and to himself, through a rigidity he sees as an assertion of dignity. What about my life? she asks him in the midst of an especially wrenching confrontation, Mr. Scott wrote. What is most remarkable about this film is how thoroughly  how painfully, how honestly, how beautifully  it answers that question.  Photo        Michael Dorman, left, and Mark Boone Jr. in Patriot.
