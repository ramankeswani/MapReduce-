The original caption reads: Dec. 16, 1960: The remains of a mid-air collision of two planes over New York City wreaked death and chaos on the corner of Sterling Place and Seventh Avenue in Brooklyn, where a United Airlines flight from Chicago fell. The other plane, a Trans World Airlines flight from Ohio, fell on Staten Island. One 11-year-old boy survived , only to perish the next day . The death toll, 134, was the highest in United States aviation history at the time. Allyn Baum was the photographer.

Marnie copes with this separation in her usual fashion, calling Lori amid visits to the mall (cue the Crate & Barrel product placements) and visits to Loris dogs, Loris friends and Loris shrink. Marnie has started to see the therapist (Amy Landecker in a quick, deadpan turn) at Loris urging, though mostly she seems to go as a way to insinuate herself even more deeply into her daughters life. Its no wonder that Marnie seems like a smother-mother whos one 911 call away from a restraining order; no wonder too that she seems lonely. _________ The Word of the Day and the quiz question have been provided by Vocabulary.com .

Some basic tenets: Dont admit fault, dont admit that you got played, dont give any credence to the inner narrative that might complicate the outer one.  There are a few songs like that on SweetSexySavage, the first major label album from Kehlani, the Oakland, Calif., R&B singer who, over the course of two self-released albums, has emerged as an idiosyncratic lyricist with discernible swagger. But the most striking moments on this refreshingly warm LP are the others, the ones where she conveys weakness, vulnerability and self-awareness. _________   Think you know credence?

Chinese-built subway cars will soon appear in Chicago and Boston, Beijing is building a $5 billion high-speed rail line in Indonesia, and the Chinese government recently christened new rail freight service between London and Beijing. Another ambitious system in the works, the 2,400-mile Pan-Asia Railway Network, would link China to Laos, Thailand and Singapore.  But few places are being reshaped by Chinas overseas juggernaut like Africa, a continent that has seen relatively little new railroad construction in a century.  Despite years of steady economic growth, sub-Saharan Africa remains hobbled by an infrastructure deficit, according to the Africa Development Bank, with only half of its roads paved and nearly 600 million people lacking access to electricity.  Chinese companies, many of them state-owned and grappling with an economic slowdown at home, have stepped unto the breach, earning about $50 billion a year on new ports, highways and airports across the continent, according to the China Africa Research Initiative at Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies. _________   Think you know juggernaut?

Hesitantly, he said, Maybe there are special places in the world that have universal human appeal. I felt a similar, uncanny rush when I noticed that, at some point while he talked, we had each instinctually taken a seat on the rock ledge, next to the hashtag, and were now sitting side by side, staring into space where the two ancient campfires once burned.  Its not an especially spiritual experience when one human being walks into another human beings kitchen for the first time and simply knows where the silverware drawer is. At the back of Gorhams, though, that intuition was spread across two distinct kinds of humans and tens of thousands of years. Ultimately, why we are here and the Neanderthals are not can no longer be explained in a way that implies that our existence is particularly meaningful or secure. But at least moments like this placed our existence inside some longer, less-conditional-seeming continuity. _________   Think you know uncanny?

The idea below explains how Robin Fogel-Shrive uses cellphone selfies to break the ice and get students writing  an idea inspired by a Times article and Learning Network Student Opinion prompt. Do you teach, or learn, with The New York Times? Tell us about it here. _________ Idea : Students are asked to take their phone out and photograph themselves in selfie mode. The selfies serve as a springboard for writing and discussion, and along the way they help create classroom connections between teacher and students. Teacher : Robin Fogel-Shrive Institution : Konocti Education Center and William Carle Continuation High School in Lower Lake, Calif. Grade Level : Grades 9-12 _________  Photo         Credit Kobie Mathies    What Ms. Fogel-Shrive Did, and Why, in Her Own Words My teaching idea originally came from the October 2013 New York Times Sunday Review article,  My Selfie, Myself , and the Learning Network post,  Why Do We Take Selfies?  The focus on the selfie phenomenon, including todays Instagram and Snapchat applications, is a subject that can provide a bridge in the high school classroom, as students express themselves and share their chosen selfie persona with their fellow classmates and their classroom teacher.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   As a way to connect with my students at the beginning of the school year, and additionally to provide an engaging topic for a pretest writing assignment as a diagnostic tool for assessment, I found the selfie reading selection to be a perfect springboard for close reading of a complex text. Students, accustomed to school policy on keeping their phones in their backpacks, were certainly surprised and eager to be requested by me to take out your phones, take a selfie and send it to me!  Continue reading the main story         Advertisement   Continue reading the main story       While some students did not have access at the time (wireless and equipment challenges), and some wanted more time to prepare for their close-up, this prereading activity was captivating and enjoyable for students. Students background knowledge on the subject was acknowledged, and the article and questions posed provided the opportunity for rich discussion, entering the conversation, and connection to the writing task. Questions posed and then incorporated in a quickwrite were based on those in the Learning Network post, Why Do We Take Selfies? They included:  How often do you take selfies  pictures of yourself  with your cellphone camera and send them to someone, or post them on social media?  What kind do you take, and what reactions do you usually get?  Why do you think there has been such an increase in this kind of picture-taking in recent years? We then read the entire article over a period of a few days, while I printed and created a bulletin board of their selfies as they were sent to me. This display was maintained all year, and provided a forum of self-expression and classroom collaboration. Students discussed key concepts of the selfie phenomenon and responded to the following questions for their writing task:  Why do we take selfies? How does the selfie differ from a photograph taken by another, and what does this tell us about ourselves and our society?  Is taking selfies about vanity, about trying to understand how others see you, or about something else? Why do you think people take and share them?  Do you agree with the person quoted who says, The idea of the selfie is much more like your face is the caption and youre trying to explain a moment or tell a story? Why or why not?   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story    Do you agree or disagree with the closing statement that selfies can sometimes be a kind of visual diary?  Is the proliferation of selfies changing the way we have online conversations and interactions? How?  Photo         Credit Kayla Van Horn    Assessment The culminating assignment was a writing diagnostic utilized as a springboard for literacy and writing instruction across curriculums. A norming and scoring session was held after school with the teachers of core classes joining forces to analyze and determine student proficiency based on the California State University (CSU) English Placement Test (EPT) scoring guide. Teachers reviewed and discussed their observations, with an emphasis on content literacy, equity and Common Core State Standards. For my current ninth- and 11th-grade English classes, I plan to include the questioning strategy SOAPSTone (Subject, Occasion, Audience, Purpose, Speaker, Tone) into the above lessons after a first or second read of the article. Well pay particular attention to the O (Occasion), which can sometimes be a challenge, but here can be discerned in the authors introduction. SOAPSTone provides analysis of an expository text and supports the writing process. It can also be used as a formative assessment for the teacher, to determine whether students are understanding the text in its rhetorical context. The SOAPSTone strategy is an academic approach recommended by AP Central (The College Board), as well as the California State Universitys Expository Reading and Writing Curriculum (CSU ERWC), designed for postsecondary success. _________ Related Student Opinion | How Real Are You on Social Media?

The idea below explains how Joni-Jean Crivello helped foster a love of the print edition of The New York Times in students looking to connect current events to history, or just find the crossword puzzle. Do you teach, or learn, with The New York Times? Tell us about it here. _________ Idea: Use the print edition of The New York Times as a teaching tool for the social studies classroom  and as a reward Teacher: Joni-Jean Crivello Institution:  Medford Memorial Middle School , Medford, N.J. Grade Level: Middle school Why We Chose It: We admire Ms. Crivellos enthusiastic approach to bringing current events and a love of daily nonfiction reading into the social studies classroom.  Continue reading the main story         Advertisement   Continue reading the main story       _________ What Ms. Crivello Did and Why, in Her Own Words I use The New York Times almost daily as a teaching tool with my eighth-grade American history students. Connections exist consistently, whether we are analyzing American indigenous people , colonization or occupation in places like Zimbabwe , events leading to revolution, the idea of democracy , the assimilation of immigrants into American culture, the role of African Americans and women in society, civil unrest or civil war. Many adolescents will be old enough to vote in the 2020 presidential election, a compelling reason to incorporate the latest political news. As for issues, just about any article about the 2016 presidential campaign touched on separation of powers, protected speech, undue influence, gender issues, and the election process in general, to name just a few connections for students. Likewise, ISIL activities spawn discussions about fomenting rebellion and the Establishment Clause of the U.S. Constitution . Events in Baton Rouge or St. Paul have led to conversations about the fundamental right of privacy, the legacy of Reconstruction efforts, the challenges of assimilating cultures, and principles of nationalism and federalism. The Timess coverage of  Hamilton  alone is a frequent reference for both its civics content and cultural value. Middle schoolers appreciate being treated like adults by the simple act of sharing The New York Times and the multitude of discussions which always ensue. Our mission as educators is to instill a love of learning, cultivate open minds, and foster reflection of critical life events from multiple points of view. The Times offers dozens of assists in that regard every day. These young citizens care deeply for their world, but that is not possible without being included in the conversation. In addition, the Opinion page is a launching pad for persuasive and argumentative writing tasks. By including the news and editorial opinions in class periods and drawing connections with historical events, I do full lessons on the structure and general content of a newspaper. Utilizing The Times as a history teacher affords me an invaluable opportunity to stimulate the minds of our future leaders, entrepreneurs, service industry workers and journalists.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   A Suggested Activity Flip through the pages in front of your class sharing only the headlines, or a photograph or the topic of the days lead editorial. You will discover that becoming a newshound is part of our nature as curious beings. In short order, the student will turn the pages without provocation. Incorporate todays headlines and news. For example, to emphasize that the governments primary role is to keep its citizens safe, I will share parts of the Magazine article  America Is Safer Than It Used to Be. So Why Do We Still Have Calls for Law and Order?  Beyond the News Use The Times and be rewarded by students who interrupt the beginning of a daily lesson to inquire about what is in the news. Experience a teaching aha! moment when students run to you first thing in the morning to discuss an event about which they are aware. Relish in the fun of trying to solve the Final Jeopardy question and the daily crossword  talk about building knowledge and vocabulary, not to mention strategy. Most days I can barely enter my classroom without students grabbing The Times from my briefcase so they can have first crack at the crossword and Final Jeopardy. Typically, they give me my paper to hold onto until the end of the day so they could complete the puzzle or bring it home after dismissal. On the final day of school, I purchased copies of The Times for some of these students. They acted as if Santa had fulfilled their Christmas lists! A few days later, one of their moms wrote an email message to express her gratitude; she said she had experienced her first nirvana moment as a mother. On the previous day, her daughter asked her to buy a Sunday New York Times so she can read it and do the crossword puzzle. At 13! All the challenges I had experienced as a public educator in recent years melted away upon reading that one email. _________ Related   NYTimes Student Video  Video by Sarah Gross   A few years ago, two teachers from New Jersey, Sarah Gross and Jonathan Olsen, team-taught a humanities classes at High Technology High School where they began each day by reading The New York Times.

The idea below explains how Cynthia McCallister and Kate Louis use Metropolitan Diary to inspire students to write stories about life in their communities. Do you teach, or learn, with The New York Times? Tell us about it here. ________ Idea : Using Metropolitan Diary to teach high school narrative writing, and to help students become more democratically oriented citizens. Teachers : Cynthia McCallister is an associate professor of literacy and English education at New York University and the creator of the Learning Cultures curriculum model. Kate Louis is an English teacher at Urban Assembly High School for Green Careers, on Manhattans Upper West Side. Grade Levels : 9-12 Why We Chose It : Because Metropolitan Diary is a beloved feature of The New York Times, and because it lends itself to inspiring personal writing across a wide span of grade levels, skills and interests.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   ________ What Ms. McCallister Did and Why, in Her Own Words Im a teacher educator and curriculum designer who works with teachers and children in New York City K-12 public schools to improve curriculum and instruction in ways that support engagement and achievement. In my role as a coach in schools, some of what I do is show teachers and students how to master written language as a system of tools that can be used to achieve their own intentions and purposes. I also show students and teachers how to open up the curriculum to let students practice being a citizen in a free democracy through opportunities to share with one another the creative products of their own intellects.  Continue reading the main story         Advertisement   Continue reading the main story       Some of the most interesting text forms that I have shared with students have been culled from our own local newspaper, The New York Times. In New York City and around the world, The Times greases the wheels of democratic discourse. Its chock-full of stories in an almost infinitely creative presentation of forms. And one that students always seem to love the best is The Timess Metropolitan Diary. For 40 years Metropolitan Diary has been entertaining New Yorkers by providing a space for them to tell stories about themselves to each other, holding up a mirror to see reflections of irony and beauty, and all sorts of flecks in the kaleidoscope of our cultural character. This is one of my all-time favorites, about Dunkin Donuts, from March 1, 2009 : DEAR DIARY:  (This is a true story; it took place in Sheepshead Bay this winter.)  In Dunkin Donuts this morning, an old lady wearing a tattered watch cap started speaking to no one in particular.  I cant sleep at night. I have pains in my chest all the time. My leg hurts and my children do not love me.  People waiting in line hid in their cellphones, looked away or stared straight ahead.  I dont know what to do. I dont know where to turn. My husband died two years ago on the 27th.  Everyone pretended she wasnt there. The girls behind the counter took the next customers. The line inched forward.  At a side table, a beautiful young lady with matching purple scarf and hat looked at the old woman and said, simply, Honey, please sit down with me, and tell me your story.  Its possible, you see, for one person to save the world.  Mel Glenn Metropolitan Diary can provide an inspirational vehicle for students to tell their own stories about life in their hometown. The philosopher John Dewey wrote that democracy is a form of associated living  living in connection with other people, and having those connections be the fabric of society. Students can use Metropolitan Diary and other text forms from The New York Times to inspire their personal writing and to help them become more self-possessed as writers and more democratically oriented as citizens of our world.

Related Metropolitan Diary   Credit Librado Romero/The New York Times    The Writing Process We Use In most writing classrooms, teachers normally have to follow curriculum programs that dictate units of study. They assign students spaces to sit, and restrict whom they talk to so theyll get their work done. Shared interests are restricted by the limitations of the curriculum, and the interplay of forms of association are anything but free. These kinds of practices teach an ethos of suppression rather than self-expression, and they are antithetical to democratic life. We let students have complete freedom to write on topics of their own choice in forms of their own choosing  so the classroom space promotes democratic processes that can foster selfhood. And because the conversations students have about experiences are, essentially, the first drafts of their writing, they are instructed how to be thoughtful about making good choices to sit with people who will inspire rich conversations about writing ideas, and to find spaces in the classroom conducive to talk. Genre Exposure To ensure that students interests develop in numerous and varied ways, teachers conduct 10-minute Genre Exposure lessons each day. In Genre Exposure lessons, teachers use a wide variety of texts to inspire students personal writing. We ask students to think of the following, in relation to a text: What is it? What is this form called? Where is it found or used? By whom? For what purpose? What is its author trying to do or achieve? What responsive understanding is she or he seeking in the reader? What literary devices or text conventions is she or he using to achieve the intended response? (What conventions or literary devices is the author using to achieve the purpose?) Take a look at students in Kate Louiss writing classroom at the Urban Assembly High School for Green Careers . They have the option to sit where they please and write what they want (so long as they submit assignments on time). Kate presented Metropolitan Diary in a Genre Exposure lesson. Heres how she did it, in her own words: I shared the wonderful Dunkin Donuts article and this one .  Before introducing the genre examples, I shared the About Metropolitan Diary piece . We talked about how this is an opportunity for anyone to submit writing to The New York Times and what a special opportunity that is.  We then read the two examples aloud together. I asked students to articulate the purpose of the genre and a ninth grader volunteered, to talk about everyday experiences in New York City. I challenged them to think about how a reader would react differently to the two different examples. They agreed that one is meant to make you laugh and one is meant to make you cry, but they both tell stories that reveal what is so special about New York.  We asked students to brainstorm places where they see special, interesting or crazy things every day in their travels around the city. They came up with the train, the bus, the park (Central Park and the parks in their neighborhoods), sports practice, the bodega and the streets around school.  Jeannie Zonneveld, my co-teacher, suggested that our school is a vibrant place full of stories, some hysterical and some heartbreaking. We are an unscreened public high school and therefore we are very much a part of the public realm. This was eye-opening for me and for the students. I think we were all recollecting our craziest subway stories until Jeannie pointed out that the stories that make New York live right where we sat. On this day, Kates discussion detailed the traits and features of the Metropolitan Diary form. Her use of the exposure lesson  which can be used with any other form from The Times or any other text  helped surface students insights about how texts function. This helped them gain a better understanding about how to use texts  both composing and decoding them  to better communicate with others. Note : Take a look at this handout of Genre Collection Probes to use with students to help them analyze texts and to guide your own Genre Exposure lessons.  Photo        Chiara Maldonado, Alysha Ramirez meet with Winni Zhu, who is sharing her writing in a Writing Share.   Credit Kate Louis    Writing Work Time After the lesson, students have 40 minutes to spend on their own writing agendas during Work Time . Staggered throughout the ranking period are due dates for projects that align with Common Core State Standards expectations for writing narratives, informative pieces and arguments. Students determine when they need to schedule deadlines for drafts and Table Share meetings with peers to get feedback. Teachers use a Writing Conference Record as a context to support self-regulation of the writing process and to provide feedback to each student on a monthly basis. The Record prompts students to consider how their writing aligns with expectations from the Common Core State Standards for writing . The Share At the conclusion of writing time is The Writing Share , in which two students take turns sitting at the front of the room, taking responsibility to gain attention and manage their audience. They project an image of their writing from the document camera, state the purpose of their piece, tell the audience what kind of feedback they want, and read it aloud.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   For example, if I were sharing a draft of a Dunkin Donuts story, I might say, This is a Metropolitan Diary, and my purpose is to move the reader. I want to know from you the ways that I can make the piece persuade readers that one persons act of compassion is enough to save the entire world through the eyes of a single person who is suffering.  Photo        A subway rider swiping a MetroCard at Times Square. Related Metropolitan Diary   Credit Michael Nagle for The New York Times    Student Writing Examples Students in Kates class werent told to write a Metropolitan Diary on the day of the lesson. In fact, most kids were in the midst of other projects of their own choosing and decided not to write a Metro Diary piece the day of the lesson. But if the texts selected for the exposure lesson are compelling, students will choose to write them. After Kates lesson, there were several takers , three of whose pieces are shared here. (Note: These pieces arent yet finalized.) Dear Diary,  To the guy I sat on the D train:  I was on my very enjoyable morning commute to school. So I got on the train like usual and I was holding the pole like a normal person trying not to die and minding my own business.  This was going well, until we got to the 9th Ave. stop in Brooklyn. Im standing there and one lady comes on the train, and in doing so, pushes me. And, like God Bless America, did she have strength. I mean it was like Sparta all over again, with her knocking me into some unforeseen doom. She pushed me so hard that my 53 bag of bones took off.  I failed to comprehend what was going on. Next thing I know, Im sitting on something soft. I was like, oh well, at least I didnt die. Then I started to register what I fell on  it wasnt some thing , it was some one .  Hey, are you O.K.? he asked, in the polite way you might ask someone who just fell onto your lap. Yeah, Im so sorry, mister, I said quickly, turning bright red. I got up, took a place by the door, and got off at the next stop.  Only, I had seven more stops to go. What a great start to the morning.   Chiara Maldonado  Dear Diary,  I am a part of what makes New York diverse. I came here from Mexico when I was two. I am an immigrant, but all I remember is New York.  My parents came here to look for a better future. They left Mexico with the mind-set of giving me and my older brother a better lifestyle. Just like my parents there are other people who have come to New York to try to achieve whatever dream they have. Ive come to realize that New York wouldnt be the city it is without immigrants.  In New York you get to experience the different places where people come from. Our childhood was mostly spent going to the bodegas that are owned by Latinos. Not only that but some of the best pizza shops in New York are owned by Italians or when youre craving rice over chicken you go to the Halal food truck. I mean, you name it, its like nothing is impossible. If you come to New York with a dream youll achieve it, trust me.   Leida Resendiz  Dear Diary:  I was already late for practice at 4:30. I was running into the train station when the speaker announced, The next uptown, local, Van Courtland-bound 1 train is approaching the station, please stand away from the platform edge.  Standing on the platform edge, people shoved in and out of the train cars with such sullen attitudes. All right miss, say excuse me, floundered across the entrances of the train with eye rolls.  Halfway through my trip, approaching 145th Street, a middle-aged lady entered the station with a tumor on her cheek. This had probably been the tenth time Ive seen her. Shes trying to raise money so that Mount Sinai can do her surgery.  She tells us her story and asked for spare change, ending with, Thank you and god bless you all.  No one on the train car spared any change.   Azra Muratovic Over the course of the year, each student develops an oeuvre of writing that reflects his or her individuality and sense of purpose as a student and a developing person, and that has been shaped through inspiration from a rich wellspring of varied and numerous text forms, such as the Metropolitan Diary, and through suggestions offered by peers about how to make the writing work as its supposed to. Conclusion If democracy and community life are one and the same, as John Dewey maintained they were, then Metropolitan Diary is democracys personal journal. Children in a democracy need opportunities to share personal stories for their own self development. But just as important, for humanitys improvement and survival, we depend on our children having opportunities to share them. _________ Related: Our lesson plan From Lives to Modern Love: Writing Personal Essays With Help From The New York Times  Continue reading the main story        Were interested in your feedback on this page.

Credit photo courtesy of Paulette DeRito     Its Reader Idea Week on The Learning Network. The idea below explains how Paulette DeRito uses three different Times features to incorporate persuasive writing, science and math in the E.L.L. classroom. Do you teach, or learn, with The New York Times? Tell us about it here . _________ Idea: English language learners in an elementary school use Times restaurant reviews, ScienceTake videos and the Science Q. and A. feature to practice writing, learn science and solve math problems. Teacher: Paulette DeRito is an English Learner Specialist at the Barlow Mountain School , Ridgefield, Conn. Grade Level: 2, 3, 4, 5 (high-level English language learners) Why We Chose It: We appreciate Ms. DeRitos ability to home in on short Times videos, restaurant reviews and science articles to use with elementary students who are learning English and create a curriculum that inspires wonder, reminds students of their home country and culture and capitalizes on their curiosity about the world around them.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   _________  Photo         Credit Christopher Gregory for The New York Times    What Ms. DeRito Did and Why, in Her Words Persuasive Writing Idea: Use a New York Times restaurant review that relates to students (or their parents) countries of origin as the basis for a one-page persuasive argument about why the restaurant would be worth a visit.  Continue reading the main story         Advertisement   Continue reading the main story       The restaurant review we used was  Russian Dumplings, Like Grandmas, at Two Village Spots , which tells about a Russian food cart and a Ukrainian restaurant. These were of interest to my student from Belarus, as the owner of the food cart is also from Belarus. In this case, the students understanding of English made him able to understand the review as I read it aloud to him. The details of the food items were all familiar to him also. This is an excellent way to pay tribute to the country where a student is from. There are many restaurant reviews which can be searched by cuisine, thereby tailoring the activity to a students country of origin or food that is familiar. What We Did 1. We talked about local places to eat in our town, and which ones we like and why we like them. We discussed different ways a restaurant owner can get people to come to the restaurant and wrote them on sticky notes: Advertise in a newspaper; offer a coupon for a free meal; post specials or photographs of the food on social media; foster word of mouth (for my students, this concept needed to be explained); and, finally, try to get reviews of the restaurant in a newspaper, online, or on a site like Yelp . 2. We then discussed what a person could potentially learn from reading a review: the restaurants name and location, the type of food served, the reviews opinion about the quality of the food, a description of the dining room, how casual or formal it is. 3. Next, I read the review to my student, making note of difficult words, which he then used context clues to figure out the meanings. 4. We reread the review, this time focusing on the restaurant information at the conclusion of the article: the address, the restaurant website, the recommended dishes, the price symbols and what they stand for, when its open, whether the restaurant takes reservations or can accommodate a person with a wheelchair, and how easy it is to find a parking spot. Writing Activity Write a one-page persuasive essay telling your family why you should visit this restaurant or food cart. Remember to explain what type of food is offered, how long it might take to get there from home, and why you think they would like it. Write about the prices of the food, and the dishes you think would be good to try. Remember, you have to convince them that its worth the trip! _________  Video   ScienceTake | Building a Rescue Roach    Cockroaches move so well through small spaces that they make good models for robots to find survivors in collapsed buildings.  By DAVID FRANK and JAMES GORMAN on Publish Date February 8, 2016.  .  Watch in Times Video          embed            Science Idea: Use a New York Times Science video to learn about how the behavior of bugs can help scientists build a robot.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   James Gormans science videos and related articles inspire many activities, yielding new vocabulary words and thought-provoking discussions. Because of their short length, the videos work well with younger students. (Also note: There is always an advertisement first.) In about two minutes, students can learn something very interesting. In particular, the video  Building a Rescue Roach  helps students understand how science can help us. As they will learn, by studying how cockroaches can fit themselves into small spaces, scientists can build a rescue robot to help victims trapped in a collapsed building or to help gather information after a disaster. What We Did 1. Discussed what we already knew  or thought we knew  about cockroaches: They are dirty, they run away when you turn the lights on, they tend to live in crowded cities. 2. Listed describing words for cockroaches: slimy, ugly, dirty, creepy. 3. Looked at the photo of the rescue roach (shown above) and talked about what was going on in the image. 4. Watched the video about how cockroaches can be used to help scientists build a robot that can fit into small spaces. 5. Discussed whether it is right to use bugs to help us. Luckily, Mr. Gorman explained that the roaches were not harmed during the flattening. Questions for Students 1. What is the order of the steps the scientists took to test the roaches? 2. What were the results of the research? 3. Why do you think the scientists used roaches? Why didnt they use other bugs? 4. Do you think its right that the scientists tried to flatten the roaches? Is it fair to use insects to help us? (This can lead to a good discussion about animal testing and animal rights.)

We used  How Many Eggs Does a Chicken Lay in Its Lifetime ? for this activity. What We Did: 1. We wrote down everything we know about hens, and then I asked these questions: Did you know there are different types of hens? Did you ever wonder how many eggs a chicken lays in its lifetime? Do you think chickens make good pets? Why or why not? Where can you find hens? 2. After we read the article , we discussed how important it is to wonder about things and how this can help you become a good researcher. 3. Students used the figure 276 eggs per year to create bar graphs that show weekly egg production for a month and monthly egg production for a year. _________ Related: Our full collection for English language learners .
