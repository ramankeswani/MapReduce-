If I were still a good driver in a few years, Id consider a semiautonomous car, he said. Credit Brittany Greeson for The New York Times By  Mary M. Chapman March 23, 2017 Single, childless and 68, Steven Gold has begun to think about future mobility and independence. Although in good health, he can foresee a time when he wont be a confident driver, if he can drive at all. While he hopes to continue to live in his suburban Detroit home, he wonders how he will be able to get to places like his doctors office and the supermarket if his driving becomes impaired. For Mr. Gold and other older adults, self-driving cars might be a solution. The number of United States residents age 70 and older is projected to increase to 53.7 million in 2030, from 30.9 million in 2014, according to the Institute for Highway Safety. Nearly 16 million people 65 and older live in communities where public transportation is poor or nonexistent. That number is expected to grow rapidly as baby boomers remain outside of cities. The aging of the population converging with autonomous vehicles might close the coming mobility gap for an aging society, said Joseph Coughlin, the director of the Massachusetts Institute for Technology AgeLab in Cambridge. He said that 70 percent of those over age 50 live in the suburbs, a figure he expects to remain steady despite a recent rise in moves to urban centers. Further, 92 percent of older people want to age in place, he said. Mr. Coughlin said on-demand services like Uber and Lyft were viable alternatives to autonomous cars, but are not available in many areas where older adults live. Although these companies now offer limited app-free services, some older people are wary of riding with strangers and being able to identify the right vehicle. For his part, Mr. Gold said such services were too expensive for regular use. Doris Alexander, a retired registered nurse who lives in Chicago, recently tried Uber for the first time, enjoyed it, and cannot envision going driverless. I wouldnt know how to act, said Ms. Alexander, 77, who typically relies on public transportation. The concept that Im in a car, the car is driving, and I have no driver  its just something thats a little too strange for me. In many cases, as with Mr. Gold, there are no children around to provide transportation. A recent study led by Dr. Maria Torroella Carney of Northwell Health in Great Neck, N.Y., found that 22 percent of baby boomers are now or at risk of becoming so-called elder orphans, with limited access to transportation. If I were still a good driver in a few years, Id consider a semiautonomous car, said Mr. Gold, who lives in Oak Park, Mich., and drives a 2015 Honda Fit. And if I were in a situation where driving was too physically difficult, then Id consider a fully autonomous car. Along with other firms, automakers including Audi, General Motors, Ford Motor, Nissan, Honda, Mercedes-Benz, Volvo and BMW are all in the race to reduce or eliminate the amount of time a person in a vehicle is actually driving. There are several levels of autonomy, going in stages from driver assistance to full automation. For example, by 2020 Honda is aiming to bring to market a vehicle with a high level of automated capability in highway situations. By years end, Volvo plans to put highly automated XC90 vehicles in the hands of real-world drivers in Sweden as part of its Volvo Drive Me program. Within the next four years, BMW hopes to have cars on the street with midlevel automation. BMW and other companies are also working on driverless prototypes that have no steering wheel, brake or gas pedal. Still, a world in which fully automated cars are common remains many years away. Its all going to be a slow transition, said Nicole Carriere, director of public relations for Edmunds.com. There will be a fundamental shift, but it wont be overnight. The spectrum of vehicles eventually coming to market will allow older drivers to consider the types that suit them best. For example, some auto manufacturers are developing semiautonomous systems that give drivers seconds to prepare to re-engage to avoid collision, and will pull to the side of the road if re-engagement is not detected. Experts say such systems may not be optimal for those who take some medications or may have difficulty reorienting themselves. Keep in mind that driving abilities vary among older adults, said Dr. Nir Barzilai, director of the Institute for Aging Research at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine in the Bronx. Its not chronological age thats important, its biological, he said. There are 100-year-old drivers who are fine, and some 60-year-olds who shouldnt be on the road. James Kenyon is a Detroit franchise owner of Visiting Angels, an agency that provides nonmedical home care for seniors. From what he has observed, older seniors could have a difficult time adjusting to driverless technology. Its a whole mind-set change for the elderly to have something that they cant control, and even getting their children to buy into it, Mr. Kenyon said. Theoretically, it sounds great, but there are so many possible impediments that have to be worked out, like, if theres a problem, what do they do? One fear is ending up at the wrong destination, a worry that should not be paramount, said Oliver Rumpf-Steppat, head of BMWs United States product requirements engineering division. Although autonomous-car production is still in the test phase, he said vehicles would most likely rely on voice-recognition systems. You can say, Take me to the eye doctor or grocery store. It will come back and ask which one, he said. Most of the time, we get it right. Marcus Rothoff also hopes to assuage concerns. He is the project leader of the Volvo Drive Me program, which aims to include 100 Swedish drivers over several months. One goal, he said, is to see how older drivers handle the new technology. We need people who are a bit skeptical about autonomous driving  otherwise we will not learn how to build trust and understand their views and expectations, he said. One important group is senior drivers. Ultimately, the driver interface and interaction needs to be so intuitive that no training is needed. Mr. Coughlin said purveyors of autonomous technology would be smart to keep older drivers in mind. If seniors dont trust the technology and dont like giving up control, he said, it will slow down this business dramatically.

Mike: Aloha, Farhad! Im back from vacation in Hawaii, where I spent a week eating fish and getting tan. I would have stayed forever, but I think my presence was affecting their tourist economy. Also I need to find a way to keep this tan going, because I look great. How was work? I have no idea what was going on in my absence. Farhad: I had the best week of my life. Mike: Hmm. Ill try not to read too much into that. Lets talk tech. So Genius, formerly known as RapGenius, formerly known as the company whose co-founder couldnt stop getting in trouble , seems to be in some sort of trouble. The Verge reported on Geniuss strategic shifts and layoffs this week, which includes apparently moving away from the companys focus on annotation of texts on the internet and embracing some sort of video-centric plan. I honestly have no idea what that means, but it bums me out mostly because I was a big fan of Genius and its annotations, which were crowdsourced from the knowledgeable folks on the web.

Continue reading the main story         Advertisement   Continue reading the main story       Farhad: Everyone had the same take on Twitter, but let me repeat it here: Genius could have been a nice simple website with a nice simple business. Its annotations of rap lyrics are often good (though sometimes they read like white teenagers explaining black people to the world: I was once looking up the lyrics of the Chance the Rapper song Summer Friends and found this gem: In the black culture, grandmas play no games and dont tolerate talking back.) Mike: Good lord. Thats embarrassing. Farhad: Anyway, RapGenius was a fine idea but, fueled by venture capital dollars, it set its sights on something much grander: not just annotating rap lyrics but annotating the world  news documents, speeches, anything. I never got this. The company never proved the case that people online wanted to read long primary texts and then annotations of the text. The whole interface seemed too finicky and required too much work of a reader. And unless David Foster Wallace himself was annotating the news, most annotations werent very good. I hope the lyrics site survives, but Im not surprised that the rest of it is blowing up. Mike: Venture capitalists desperately chasing growth at all costs, eh? Color me shocked. GoPro, meanwhile, continued its slow trudge toward complete irrelevance, as it laid off a significant number of people in an attempt to move toward profitability. Sad, but I guess the market for videos of  shredding that sick powder  isnt as large as they previously believed. Farhad: Its just another one of those companies swallowed up by the smartphone. Now that the iPhone is waterproof Im not sure why most of us would ever need to go pro. Mike: Youre just trying to cover up your disappointment at not being the next Tony Hawk. Oh, also, McDonalds was in the news a few times this week. Theyre working on a mobile ordering option , like Starbucks, which I think is brilliant. Now I dont have to face the shame of ordering two double quarter-pounders with extra cheese from a cashier who is clearly disgusted with my life choices. Thank god for the internet.

My wife didnt really want a big new TV, but a hacker did it, so what can you do? Mike: Heres something big that I seem to have missed while I was gone. On Monday, Intel announced it had bought Mobileye , an Israeli company that builds sensors and cameras that go into self-driving vehicles. Intel paid $15.3 billion for the company. You can weigh the pros and cons of an acquisition like this  and many have already  but for me it brings up another larger theme around Intel and its strategy of the last, oh, 10 years or so. Farhad : Wait, you want to launch into a deep exploration of the chip business? Vacation changed you, Mike. Mike : I think I got too much sun. Now all I can think about is microprocessing. Seriously though, do you remember years ago when Intel was king of the mountain? The company held court over the realm of the desktop personal computer. Intel made powerful chips that were the workhorses of PCs for decades, and for decades the trend was that people wanted bigger, better and faster desktops to power more and more programs that were growing more sophisticated. That includes stunning games with complicated graphics, the rise of Photoshop, and video editing software. The problem came in the shift to mobile devices. BlackBerry, Palm and, of course, the rise of the iPhone, decimated Intels gargantuan lead in desktop computing as people found that they could do so much of what they did at home, sitting in front of a screen, from their phones. Now the smartphone is a global phenomenon, forever changing modern computing, and Intels power-hungry processors tailor-made for desktops dont fit in with that new version of the world. So for the past 10 years, Intel has tried to forge a path ahead. First it was attempts to build smartphone chips , which didnt really work. Next was a huge bet on the Internet of Things, a future in which every device from our toasters to our TV sets will be connected to the internet and powered by processors. Were far from that being a reality, and Intels bet there hasnt really yielded dividends quite yet. So now, apparently, the bet for Intel is self-driving cars  or rather, providing the components for them  an industry currently receiving untold billions of dollars of investment from automakers to technology giants, all betting on an autonomous future. Do you think this is a smart move for Intel? I found it a bit schizophrenic, but also not necessarily ill advised.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   Farhad: There are two obvious problems with this deal: Its expensive and its late. Intel should be creating companies like Mobileye, not waiting until theyre mature and worth billions to buy them. Otherwise, though, this does seem like a better bet than a lot of other stuff the company has been into lately. The auto market is huge, and every car is going to get more and more intelligence. Intel can combine its own manufacturing expertise with Mobileeyes insights to become the main shop for carmakers looking to add smarts to their vehicles. To me, the real question in this deal is what happens to the automakers. This deal is yet another sign that the future of the auto business will be determined as much by what happens in Silicon Valley as what happens in Detroit. Not only are tech companies creating more of the tech in cars, theyre also changing the business model of the industry (through things like sharing) and the infrastructure around it (by pushing for electrification of cars). None if this bodes well for traditional carmakers. Anyway, nice to have you back, Mike. Mike: Mahalo!  Continue reading the main story        Were interested in your feedback on this page.

Credit John Taggart for The New York Times     The center serving drivers of New Yorks yellow taxis is 3,000 square feet. The center serving the citys Uber drivers is 30,000 square feet. The taxi center invites cabdrivers to rest their feet in a cluttered office with utilitarian furnishings and fliers taped to the walls. They can use the bathroom, grab a cup of coffee and take advantage of free training classes and legal assistance. Opened in 2015, it is the first such center in the history of yellow cabs in New York City, industry leaders say. Just a mile away, the Uber center deploys a dozen concierges in black T-shirts to sign in drivers with iPads in a gleaming, airy sanctuary tastefully outfitted with flat-screen monitors, sleek couches and a wall-size print of abstract renderings of New York landmarks. There are bathrooms upstairs and downstairs, a self-serve coffee bar and plush carpeting so new it is spotless. There is also a raft of lucrative perks that are unmatched by the taxi center: signing bonuses, paying for two weeks of a drivers car lease and free medical checkups. The Uber center  officially called a Greenlight Hub  opened in December, part of the ride-hail apps all-out war to recruit drivers and win riders. It is the largest and fanciest of more than 200 across the country, including in Los Angeles, Chicago, Washington, Philadelphia and Miami.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   The upending of the traditional taxi business across the United States and around the world by Uber, Lyft and other ride-hailing services has given consumers new and sometimes cheaper options and forced cities to re-examine their transportation policies. Uber, in some places, has employed aggressive techniques to evade regulatory limits, and prompted demonstrations by taxi drivers and owners in places like Paris, London and Brasilia. And it has ignited an intense competition for drivers, nowhere more so than in New York.  Photo        Kanchan Das, a driver safety instructor, spoke to a class inside a center for taxi drivers about a mile away from Ubers driver center.   Credit John Taggart for The New York Times    But Uber has also had a contentious relationship with its drivers over working conditions. A series of fare cuts to attract more passengers has drawn protests from drivers who say it hurts their bottom line, and led to a recent confrontation between Travis Kalanick, the chief executive of Uber, and a driver that was captured on video. Uber drivers are considered independent contractors, and some have sued the company to try to get health insurance and other employee benefits.  Continue reading the main story         Advertisement   Continue reading the main story       Despite the conflicts, Uber is a relentless competitor, and the taxi and Uber centers that have opened in different sections of the same neighborhood in Queens are a visible manifestation of how the rival industries continue to take on each other out of view of their customers. Both have introduced amenities for drivers once unheard-of in a no-frills industry, but Ubers showstopping center and incentives underscore how the deep-pocketed newcomer has become the behemoth in a crowded field. These centers embody the growing divide on New York Citys streets between old and new, tradition and innovation, that have forced the taxi industry to embrace new ways to counter the growing reach of the ride-hailing apps. Just as riders can now stick out a hand for a yellow cab or tap an app for a black car, drivers have a choice, too. Do they stay with a struggling taxi industry that has been a fixture of New York life for over a century? Or do they join the ranks of the ride-hail apps that are reshaping the citys transportation landscape ? Shaon Chowdhury, 39, who manages a yellow taxi garage in Queens, said he was seeing more Uber drivers pick up shifts driving yellow cabs because Ubers rates are low and they cannot make enough money. My best friend drives for Uber and cries all the time, he said. That friend, Ben Chowdhury, 42, who is not related, said he made less money, and worked longer hours, than when he started driving for Uber two years ago. He typically earns $20 to $25 an hour, down from $30 to $35, because of the companys fare cuts.  Photo        Hager Krahn, a new driver, said Uber has helped supplement her familys income.

We are busy but were just not making enough money. But for some, the centers have made it easier to drive for Uber. Hager Krahn, 28, a mother of two young children earns up to $80 for four hours of driving at night to supplement her familys income.

Yellow-cab drivers are also feeling more wanted as the taxi industry tries to stave off defections and lure new workers. Donald Friedman, 63, who has been driving since 1972, said he had made money ferrying around passengers including the likes of Bette Davis and Norman Mailer. But until now, he said, he never felt that anyone had his back. In 45 years, theres never been anything like this, Mr. Friedman said, sitting with fellow cabbies at the taxi center. Nobody advocated for the driver. If you dropped dead on the road, they would charge you to tow the car back to the garage. Thats the kind of help drivers would get  nothing.  Photo        Donald Friedman, 63, who has been driving a cab since the early 1970s, said he has never felt much support from the industry until now.   Credit John Taggart for The New York Times    Citywide, the number of drivers licensed by the citys Taxi and Limousine Commission has climbed to 156,413 from 145,674 in 2015. The drivers, who are considered independent contractors under federal labor guidelines, receive a single universal license that allows them to drive a taxi, livery or black car, making it easy to switch allegiances. The epicenter for the driver wars has become Long Island City, Queens, where both Uber and the Taxi and Limousine Commission have offices in the Falchi building , a renovated loft-style warehouse with an artisanal food court. Lyft was the first to stake a claim on the fourth floor of the building in 2014 with a 12,000-square-foot center where drivers are welcomed with pretzels and soft drinks while Lyft employees spin crowd-pleasing tunes on a Sonos wireless sound system. Gett, a ride-hailing app popular in Europe , moved in last year to the same floor, offering a technology training bar for drivers to get help using its app along with signing bonuses, free coffee and treats. Other ride-hailing apps have set up driver centers elsewhere in the city: Juno has a center near La Guardia Airport that serves about 150 drivers a day; Via has a center in Manhattan that, among other things, offers free parking for new drivers. But leave it to Uber to open a sprawling center in the Falchi building, replacing a smaller center in the neighborhood. Uber says the new center has already drawn more than 10,000 drivers. It is one of four Uber centers in New York City alone, Ubers largest United States market; the others are in Manhattan, Brooklyn and the Bronx. We believe we owe it to the drivers that partner with us to provide support face to face, Josh Mohrer, a general manager for Uber, said.  Photo        New driver applicants at Uber. The center is part of Ubers intense campaign to continue building its business and its increasing popularity has hurt the yellow cab industry.   Credit John Taggart for The New York Times    On a recent afternoon, over 100 drivers crowded into Ubers Queens center. Think Apple store, only nicer. A chime sounded and a concierge materialized to escort someone when it was his or her turn to meet with experts in blue T-shirts at long, communal tables in the back  the Uber version of the Genius bar.

Medical checkups and training classes are available, as well as Uber 101 orientations for new drivers. (The center is open even to drivers who choose not to sign up with Uber.) Against one wall, Ubers corporate partners promote specials on cellphone plans, car leases and insurance. It makes it simple and easy if you want to start driving for Uber, said Sumeet Singh, 22, a college student who was visiting the center for the first time a couple of weeks ago. The Uber center is a bright spot for a company that was recently accused of trying to profit during airport protests against President Trumps first immigration order and has been criticized over sexual harassment claims . The taxi center is also battling to retain and attract new drivers, albeit in a more modest setting. The Metropolitan Taxicab Board of Trade, which represents the owners of 5,500 yellow cabs, opened the driver resource center. Many taxi drivers have abandoned yellow cabs for ride-hailing apps in recent years, leaving cars idle in garages  a sharp turn from the days when those garages kept waiting lists because they had more potential drivers than cars.  Photo        Fritz Foreste, a cabdriver, said the taxi driver center helped him win the dismissal of a traffic citation.   Credit John Taggart for The New York Times    We had to do something, said Jean Barrett, the taxi groups executive director. This driver community is our business. More than 4,000 drivers have used the center, Ms. Barrett said, and drivers are walked through each step of the licensing and renewal process, including filing their applications online. It offers free classes in defensive driving and how to assist passengers in wheelchairs. The classes, required by the licensing process, would typically cost $150 or more. Three lawyers and two legal assistants help drivers contest parking tickets, summonses from the taxi commission and other violations  more than 3,000 of them so far  and accompany them to hearings.

With the centers help, the ticket was dismissed after he explained that he had left his yellow cab at a taxi relief stand for 15 minutes to take a bathroom break. They take care of us here, he said. Ronald Gathers, 71, a taxi driver for four decades, went to the center for help last year after he was unable to renew his license because he was sick. After he recovered, the center contacted the taxi commission, and got his license renewed in one day.   Even so, Mr. Gathers said he had heard so much about Uber that he could not resist checking out its new center recently. It was not for him, he said. He returned to his friends at the taxi center. Id be a traitor, he said. I came back to yellow.

Credit Fasten     AUSTIN, Tex.  When I arrived in Austin this month for the annual South by Southwest festival, I was prepared to time travel to a harsh past: an era when people had to wave their hands on street corners, begging for curmudgeonly cabdrivers to pull over and offer a ride. This was the picture many expected during the music, film and technology festival because Uber and Lyft, the two most popular car-summoning apps, pulled out of Austin last year after the city voted to tighten regulations on ride-sharing services. With hundreds of thousands of people attending SXSW, this sounded like a recipe for disaster. Yet the reality  for me and many attendees I spoke with  was that getting around Austin during the festival was easy. Several smaller ride-sharing services were operating in town, such as Fasten and RideAustin . Despite some hiccups with those apps, they worked well over all. And, of course, there were taxicabs hovering if you were lucky enough to get one. Setting up a new account with Fasten or RideAustin took all of a minute, said Sam Grobart, an executive editor for CNN and a former technology reporter for The New York Times, who attended the conference. Im as brand loyal to a ride service as I am to a gas station chain  which is to say not at all.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   Many attendees echoed that sentiment, and my experience was the same. During the festival, I heavily relied on car services because my Airbnb house was several miles from the conference. After taking 20 rides divided among Fasten, RideAustin and taxis, only once did I have an issue summoning a car, with Fasten on a rainy Saturday night. That left me to  heaven forbid  open an umbrella and walk a mile to my next meeting.  Continue reading the main story         Advertisement   Continue reading the main story       Issues like mine, BuzzFeed proclaimed, meant that apps like Fasten and RideAustin  flunked an important test  during a busy conference in which they could have triumphed over the big apps by maintaining smooth operations. But I saw it differently. If these smaller apps, which have less funding and fewer resources, managed to move hundreds of thousands of people around and choke only occasionally, that meant Austinites probably werent suffering without Uber and Lyft in general, especially when the city is not overrun by an enormous conference.  Photo        A screenshot of Fasten. Uber and Lyft are more polished than Fasten, but they, too, have flaws.   Credit Fasten    Kirill Evdakov, the chief executive of Fasten, which operates in Boston and Austin, said the company had completed 170,000 rides during SXSW, with a failure rate of less than half a percent. The app crashed on a Saturday when demand surged exponentially because it was pouring outside and a competing apps servers crashed, he said. Still, Mr. Evdakov said last week: Unfortunately, we let many people down. We are working even harder the rest of this week to regain their satisfaction and we hope that they will forgive us. The festival ended Sunday. RideAustin did not respond to requests for comment. There is no disputing that Lyft and Uber are superior products. Their apps are more polished and include the option to add multiple drop-off points, for example, and server crashes are rare. Yet they, too, are imperfect: Over my years using both apps, they have occasionally failed to summon a car, drivers have gotten lost and rides have been canceled inexplicably.

The companies last week attended a hearing with the House Transportation Committee at the Texas State Capitol, where lawmakers discussed legislation that would regulate ride-sharing services at the statewide level. Lyft said it was focused on getting consistent rules passed for all cities in Texas to make ride more affordable and easier to get. Uber said it felt encouraged that the Texas Legislature was considering a statewide solution. But until the services return to the city, people probably wont notice much of a difference riding with the underdogs. At the end of the day, the apps connect riders with drivers, who are imperfect people, leading to imperfect experiences. Caz Rosson, a web designer who spent nine days at SXSW, said the alternative ride-sharing apps were just like Uber and Lyft.

The company is seeking to improve relations with its drivers, who are freelancers.   Credit John Taggart for The New York Times     SAN FRANCISCO  The board of Uber is confident in its chief executive, Travis Kalanick, board member Arianna Huffington said on Tuesday, providing a show of support as the embattled ride-hailing company seeks to repair its reputation. Ms. Huffington made her remarks in a conference call with reporters that Uber announced only hours before. During the roughly 45-minute call, executives also laid out a multipart plan to get the reeling company back on track after a series of revelations about its business practices and internal unrest that have damaged its image. Of paramount importance, the company stressed, is Ubers search for a chief operating officer to help Mr. Kalanick. In addition, Uber is overhauling its human resources department, improving its relationships with drivers, and soliciting feedback from concerned employees. The company also plans to release a report on the diversity of its work force this month, and will conclude an investigation into its workplace culture by the end of April. The board is confident in Travis, and we are proceeding ahead with the search for the C.O.O., Ms. Huffington said during the call. Put very simply, change starts at the top.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   Because Uber rarely puts together such calls for the news media, the one on Tuesday reflects how the company is working to seize control of its image after a rough start to the year. In recent weeks, Ubers reputation was badly damaged after a former employee published a scathing blog post detailing what she said was a history of sexual harassment and systemic issues in the companys human resources department. Separately, Uber faced criticism for its program to deliberately deceive law enforcement using a software tool called Greyball , The New York Times reported.  Continue reading the main story         Advertisement   Continue reading the main story       Mr. Kalanick, who helped found Uber in 2009, also came under fire for how he had influenced the culture of the company. After a video of Mr. Kalanick arguing with an Uber driver recently leaked on the internet , Mr. Kalanick apologized and said he would seek leadership assistance. Several executives, including president Jeff Jones , have since left the company. Mr. Kalanick was not present during the conference call. Ms. Huffington, who joined Ubers board last year, was joined on the call by Liane Hornsey, the recently hired head of human resources, and Rachel Holt, the head of Ubers ride-hailing business in the United States and Canada. In the call, Uber said it expected that Mr. Kalanick would be highly collaborative with any executive hires. Bill Gurley, a venture capitalist and longtime Uber board member, is helping to lead the executive search for the chief operating officer, as is Ms. Huffington. Asked whether Mr. Kalanick would be willing to step down if asked, Ms. Huffington said the companys leadership has not discussed the hypothetical situation. Its clear that both Uber and the entire ride-sharing industry would not be where we are today without Travis, Ms. Huffington said. Beyond providing assistance to Mr. Kalanick, Uber said it had significant work to do to repair what appears to be a culture badly damaged by infighting and harassment.

She also noted the recent hiring of a global head of diversity, Bernard C. Coleman III. Uber plans to publish its first diversity report breaking down the gender and ethnic makeup of its work force by the end of March. Uber also is working to change its feedback system in human resources, which many current and former employees had criticized as unfair and opaque.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   Too much time is spent looking backward rather than forward, Ms. Hornsey said of the system. We need to change it. A companywide investigation into Ubers workplace practices, which is being conducted by Eric H. Holder Jr., the former United States attorney general, is expected to conclude by the end of April. Ms. Huffington said the company would honor the results of the investigation and abide by any changes recommended. Despite Ubers culture problems, Ms. Holt said the companys business remains healthy. Last week in the United States, riders took more trips with Uber than in any previous week, she said. In our most mature country, weve grown faster in the first 10 weeks of 2017 than in the first 10 weeks of 2016, Ms. Holt said during the call. Looking at less mature regions like Latin America, trips were up 600 percent in February, year on year. Uber, which has raised billions of dollars in capital, is privately valued at close to $70 billion. Employees and investors were shaken early this year when a grass-roots campaign to delete the app sprung up, following concerns that Uber was trying to capitalize on a New York taxi work stoppage. About half a million people requested deleting their Uber accounts over the course of that week, according to three people familiar with the companys internal metrics who asked not to be named because the numbers are confidential. Those deletions have slowed drastically in recent weeks, and the company continues to add new users on a weekly basis, one of the people said. Aside from internal changes, Uber said it would continue to work on improving relationships with drivers, who are freelancers that the company does not employ full-time. We need to bring more humanity to the way we interact with drivers, Ms. Holt said, noting changes in how Uber would treat rider feedback and how the company considers a drivers history on the platform.   Correction: March 24, 2017   Because of an editing error, an article on Wednesday about Ubers plans to improve its image referred incorrectly to the leadership role of Travis Kalanick since the companys founding in 2009. He helped found Uber and has been its chief executive since 2010; Mr. Kalanick has not led Uber since its founding. A headline with the continuation of the article also referred incorrectly in some copies to Mr. Kalanick as Ubers chairman.      Follow Mike Isaac on Twitter @MikeIsaac .

Jeff Jones, Ubers president of ride sharing, has left the company after just six months, Uber said on Sunday. In addition, Brian McClendon, vice president of maps and business platform at Uber, also plans to leave at the end of the month. The two men are exiting Uber under very different circumstances. Mr. Jones, who was poached from Target to be Ubers No. 2 executive, resigned after the ride-sharing companys chief, Travis Kalanick, said he needed leadership help and began a search for a chief operating officer. Mr. McClendon is departing amicably from Uber and will be an adviser to the company. In a statement, he said he was moving back to Kansas, where he is from, to explore politics. His exit has been in the works for some time, and his last day at Uber is March 28. The departures add to the executive exodus from Uber this year. Raffi Krikorian, a well-regarded director in Ubers self-driving division, left the company last week , while Gary Marcus, who joined Uber in December after Uber acquired his company, left this month. Uber also asked for the resignation of Amit Singhal , a top engineer who failed to disclose a sexual harassment claim against him at his previous employer, Google, before joining Uber. And Ed Baker, another senior executive, left this month as well.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   Mr. Jones did not respond to a request for comment.

Matt Kallman, an Uber spokesman, confirmed the departure in an email statement on Sunday. We want to thank Jeff for his six months at the company and wish him all the best, he wrote. Mr. Joness exit is problematic for Uber, as many current and former employees had seen him as a natural successor or counterpart to Mr. Kalanick. Investors and the companys board of directors were particularly keen on stabilizing the troubled company after months of internal turmoil. Mr. Kalanick has faced intense scrutiny in recent weeks for his role in fostering the combative and cutthroat culture of Ubers internal operations, and has been blamed for not properly dealing with the companys continuing human resources issues . After a video of Mr. Kalanick getting into a heated argument with a driver surfaced this month, Mr. Kalanick said he would seek leadership help, prompting the search for a chief operating officer. Mr. Jones was viewed by many as the so-called adult in the room  an executive with experience as a leader at a public company that had undergone a period of intense crisis. He oversaw Targets marketing division during and after the fallout of a major company data breach in 2013 . Uber hired Mr. McClendon, a highly respected engineer in Silicon Valley, from Google nearly two years ago to work on the companys mapping and autonomous vehicle technology initiatives. Mr. McClendon was at Google for more than a decade, and was instrumental in forming Google Earth and leading the companys geolocation technology research. His departure from Uber is concerning considering how strategically important mapping and geolocation services are to the ride-hailing company. Uber currently relies on a mix of mapping technologies from multiple companies, but also depends heavily on Google Maps, a product from one of Ubers main competitors.

One is extremely tall and skinny, the other is average height but developing breasts earlier than the others. They all look so uncomfortable in their skin. The tall girl walks hunched over, and the one with breasts rounds her shoulders to hide them. My daughter begs for heels. Id like to say something supportive. Or is that exceeding my rights as a car-pool mom? D.G., CONNECTICUT The second I read your question, an exquisite novel about two young sisters,  Housekeeping , by Marilynne Robinson, popped into my head. Particularly, an odd little scene between an eccentric aunt and the self-conscious older sister: [Aunt] Sylvie told me once that Lucille would mature before I did because she had red hair, and so it transpired. Its a childs-eye view in a book about the impermanence of life  mostly its comforts, but also its trials. I applaud your empathy, D.G., even as I worry about the logistics of addressing all three girls on a sensitive subject while they sit in the back of your S.U.V., glued to their cellphones and the minutiae of middle-school life. But if you feel kindly toward them (and theyre all kind to one another), no harm in trying. Say, Can I ask you girls a question? (If youre lucky, theyll put down their phones.) When I was your age, I felt so self-conscious about the way I looked. My friends and I were all growing at different paces. But when I look at you three, all strong and amazing, I wonder if you ever feel out of place the way I did?

We will pay for the food (and a Champagne toast), but we want to ask guests to cover the cost of their drinks. How can I say this artfully in the invitation? Id like to give people the option of bowing out if they dont want to pay for anything. JESSEE I believe the term of art is: Cash bar available. But lets put invitations aside for a second.

Unless you are making a potluck dinner, avoid asking guests to offset your costs. Better to choose a less expensive restaurant or reduce the number of invitees  and have a few bottles of wine and water on the table  than force your guests to scuttle to the bar to buy glasses of Chablis during dinner. Invariably, your generosity is hidden by its partialness. This is just my opinion. Plenty of people give parties with cash bars. It is squarely your call. But rather than looking for pretty euphemisms for your invitation, consider negotiating with the restaurant for a good price on a case of wine. (For a small corkage fee, they may let you bring your own.) And in my experience, most folks prefer a mingly cocktail party with nice hors doeuvres than a fancy dinner where theyre trapped next to your husbands boss for two hours. Still, if you decide on a cash bar, go with your impulse to warn people in advance. Who walks around with cash these days? Lets Be Friends, Again About a year ago, I stood up a friend for lunch. I didnt have a good excuse. I was just feeling really overwhelmed and blew her off. We havent spoken since. Is it too late to apologize now? It still bothers me, and I really miss her. GRETCHEN Its never too late to apologize. (Though generally, the closer to the offense, the better apologies work.) Say: Im so sorry for treating you badly last year. I was overwhelmed that day  then mortified, but thats no excuse. I hope you can forgive me now. Sadly, we dont control whether pals accept our apologies. But trying to put things right eventually is better than not trying at all.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   And speaking of overdue apologies, I owe one to  This Is Us . Early in your run, I said I liked you a lot, but youd never be able to pull off a whole season. I was wrong. Please forgive me. Her Name, His Name My boss calls me sweetie. He calls my male colleagues by their names. When I spoke to him about it, he said its because I remind him of his daughter. That stumped me. Is there a next move? ANONYMOUS Good work on two fronts: knowing that you have the right to be addressed respectfully at work and understanding that the boss may deserve some extra tact. Next time he uses the s-word, try: How do you think your daughter would feel if her boss called her sweetie? That may do the trick.

Why all the blunders at the company, Vanity Fairs editor, Graydon Carter, asked. And had Mr. Kalanick learned anything? Off in the wings of the auditorium, Bill Gurley appeared to tense. Mr. Gurley has a lot riding on Uber. His venture capital firm, Benchmark, bought into Uber six years ago, when the ride-hailing company was a mere pipsqueak. Today, what was a 20 percent stake in Uber is worth billions. Mr. Gurley is a rare figure, a Silicon Valley habitue who chides some of the biggest start-up stars to show some discipline and drop their arrogant behavior. That day in October, Mr. Kalanick passed Mr. Gurleys test. He answered calmly, saying that he could learn from leaders who had failed in the past. Weve made mistakes, Mr. Kalanick said. We always find a way to learn and to get better. Mr. Gurley relaxed visibly. Now, however, Uber faces precisely the kind of test Mr. Gurley has warned about. Former employees have said they were sexually harassed and discriminated against at the company. This month, Uber ended its use of a tool to thwart authorities in various cities who were trying to stop the ride-hailing service, after complaints that the behavior was unethical. Mr. Kalanick himself was caught on a video , which quickly went viral, in which he told one of Ubers drivers that some people just dont want to take responsibility for their own behavior, using an obscenity.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   At the same time, Uber is facing business challenges  a tarnished image, legal difficulties and competition from rivals like Lyft  and is spending big to get around those issues. The company needs to resolve the controversies and get its business back on track.  Continue reading the main story         Advertisement   Continue reading the main story       Mr. Gurley has become deeply involved in that effort. In recent weeks, he has been active in a review of Ubers practices, according to a person briefed on the discussions, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the conversations are confidential. Mr. Gurley is also helping the company search for a chief operating officer . Throughout, Mr. Gurley has remained one of Mr. Kalanicks few trusted advisers, and the two communicate several times a week, according to three people who have spoken with the men. Helping to right the ship at Uber is a somewhat fitting role for Mr. Gurley, who for years has warned about excessive risk-taking on the part of start-ups. Going against the Silicon Valley orthodoxy, the venture capitalist has urged technology start-ups to go public as soon as they are able, instead of continuing to take venture capital funding: Taking on too much venture funding, he has said, can fuel a lack of discipline. Bill was the one who pushed hard for my company, Net Gravity, to be profitable at the height of the dot-com boom in the late 1990s, said Thuan Pham, a tech entrepreneur who joined Uber in 2013 and is now chief technology officer. It was a very unpopular stance. At Uber, he is willing to speak up too. Mr. Gurley, 50, didnt respond to requests for comment on Uber. In one of three interviews last year, he said of his warnings for start-ups that I say these things because the longer bad behavior goes on, the worse things end up. Uber declined to comment on Mr. Kalanicks relationship with Mr. Gurley. Dot-Com Days Mr. Gurley, who cuts a distinctive figure in Silicon Valley in no small part because of his lanky 6-foot-9 frame, went against conventional wisdom even before he became an investor.  Photo        Bill Gurley at the offices of his venture capital firm, Benchmark, in downtown San Francisco in 2015.   Credit Peter Earl McCollough for The New York Times    The son of a NASA engineer, he grew up in Houston, obtained a computer science degree from the University of Florida, and worked at Compaq before joining the investment bank Credit Suisse First Boston in 1993 as a stock analyst. A student of behavioral economics, markets and technology, Mr. Gurley became known on Wall Street for his nonconformist calls. In 1997, after joining Deutsche Bank, he downgraded Netscape Communications, then the wildly popular company behind the Navigator web browser, because he feared it was overvalued. The stock fell about 18 percent after his report. A year later, Netscape was acquired by AOL.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   Hes not pessimistic, said Rich Barton, the founder of the real estate site Zillow, which Mr. Gurley also invested in. Hes simply ahead. In 1999, Mr. Gurley joined Benchmark Capital, as the venture firm was known at the time. Benchmark was then on a hot streak, having initially invested $5 million in eBay in 1997 and reaped a more than 50,000 percent return after the online auction marketplace went public in 1998. The firm underwent a rougher stretch during the dot-com bust in the early 2000s. Like many Silicon Valley venture firms, Benchmark watched investments  including in the online grocer Webvan and the online furniture retailer Living.com  tank. Benchmark has since maintained a consistent string of investment hits. Mr. Gurley has been active, investing in GrubHub, the food delivery company; OpenTable, the restaurant reservation system; and Zillow, all of which went public. His partners successes include investments in Twitter, Instagram, Zipcar and, most recently, Snap , the maker of the ephemeral messaging app Snapchat. Above the Crowd For more than 20 years, Mr. Gurley has maintained a personal blog, called Above the Crowd, a reference to both his height and his point of view. It has been a primary channel through which he has made his prognostications. Since 2014, the blog has tended to contain more cautionary notes about start-up behavior. In one post in 2015 , as investors were pouring money into what became known as unicorn companies  venture-backed companies valued at more than $1 billion  Mr. Gurley wrote, We are in a risk bubble. Last year, he wrote that there would be inevitable failed unicorns. Among Mr. Gurleys main concerns are Silicon Valleys growing self-importance, which he has said is expertly captured in Silicon Valley, the HBO show that lampoons the misadventures of several entrepreneurs who hope to strike it rich. The Valley reeks of entitlement, he said in an interview last year. Its bad for the industry.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   Another of Mr. Gurleys concerns relates to the way entrepreneurs have delayed initial public offerings. By staying private for as long as possible, these companies often operate without rigorous financial and operational controls, which is to their detriment, he said.

Credit Krisztian Bocsi/Bloomberg    Mr. Gurleys starkest warnings have been directed at the venture industry, now flush with more cash than at any time since the late 1990s. The flood of capital has allowed both good and bad companies to stay afloat, which Mr. Gurley said lets entrepreneurs engage in unsound business practices. For example, start-ups are encouraged to compete with one another with price cuts and discounts when investors are willing to subsidize them. In the long run, however, price cuts are not a sustainable way to keep customers. Thanks to all the easy money in the start-up system, it could take years to know which business models really work, Mr. Gurley said. For investors, that could depress returns, he added.

Marc Andreessen, a founder of Netscape who is now a venture capitalist and who has been optimistic about the start-up boom, once called Mr. Gurley his Newman, a reference to the annoying postal worker in the sitcom Seinfeld. Mr. Gurleys bearish outlook has also opened him to teasing. At his 50th birthday party last spring, his family poked fun at his distaste for unicorn companies with a slide presentation showing the investor secretly tending to a herd of the mythical creatures. Some said they appreciate Mr. Gurleys speaking out. Mr. Gurley is calling B.S. on the relentless, blind confidence, said Roger McNamee, a Silicon Valley investor, adding that it was brave. That outspokenness has not meant Mr. Gurley is always right. In 2015, onstage at the South by Southwest festival, he said there would be  some dead unicorns this year . None died that year. Since the end of 2015, the number of unicorn firms has risen to about 186 from 144, according to data from CB Insights. When the e-commerce start-up Jet.com garnered a $600 million valuation in 2015 before it had sold even a single item, Mr. Gurley tweeted his doubts and wrote when I see this stuff I fear the end is near. Last year, Jet.com sold to Walmart for more than $3.3 billion, netting a big payday for investors. Mr. Gurley later said on Twitter that he had been wrong .   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   Hes respected because of how he behaves when hes wrong, and when hes right, he makes the point in a way that makes everyone laugh, Jon Sakoda, a partner at the venture firm New Enterprise Associates, said of Mr. Gurley. The firm was one of the backers of Jet.com. An Uber Bet Of all the investments that Mr. Gurley has made in tech start-ups, none are set to be as lucrative as Uber. When Benchmark invested in Uber in 2011, the company was just two years old and its service had barely gotten off the ground. At the time, Mr. Gurley put $12 million into the company, which was then valued at $60 million. He also joined its board of directors.  Photo        An Uber driver behind official Beijing taxis in Chinas capital. Mr. Kalanick said he needed to rethink how he had done everything in China.   Credit Adam Dean for The New York Times    Today, Uber is valued at close to $70 billion  about 1,100 times as valuable as it was when Benchmark invested  and has become the worlds most valuable privately held tech start-up. Benchmark is known as one of Silicon Valleys most founder-friendly venture capital firms, meaning that it doesnt carve out special deals for itself at the expense of entrepreneurs and employees. With Uber, Benchmark agreed to let Mr. Kalanick and two of his colleagues have significant voting control over the company. That has left Mr. Gurley with few levers he can pull for influence, though he is known for his deft touch with big personalities. Whether in a boardroom or around a poker table, he ribs people and tells jokes, said Nirav Tolia, the founder of Nextdoor, a local social networking company that Benchmark funded in 2011. He loves people, and he has your best interests in mind. With Mr. Kalanick, Mr. Gurley is said to have a tight relationship. He is Ubers most engaged board member and the closest thing Mr. Kalanick has to a consigliere, according to two investors who have spoken with both men. Mr. Gurley has helped guide Mr. Kalanick with Ubers breakneck expansion into 72 countries in six years. Yet in many ways, Uber now epitomizes many of the excesses Mr. Gurley has publicly condemned, and Mr. Kalanick has said he is in no hurry to take Uber public. Uber also does not have a chief financial officer and is unready for a public offering, despite Mr. Gurleys past entreaties to prepare for the possibility, according to two people who participated in the conversations.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   Worse, Uber has been spending prolifically, using price cuts to compete with rivals and barreling into new markets at a rapid rate. Mr. Kalanick has said that after the company entered China in 2013, Uber burned through about $2 billion in three years fighting a price war against the local ride-hailing incumbent, Didi Chuxing. Mr. Gurleys thinking has occasionally held sway at Uber. Last year, with its spending in China showing few signs of abating, many investors agreed that such losses would squash any hopes of a public offering, according to four people who participated in those conversations Mr. Gurley held an informal meeting with Jean Liu, the president of Didi, in mid-2016, according to a person briefed on the get-together. Shortly thereafter, Mr. Kalanick, partly at the urging of Mr. Gurley, agreed to sell Ubers China business to Didi, with Uber taking a stake in the resulting entity. It was a win for investors. The experience was humbling for Mr. Kalanick. During the Vanity Fair conference, he told the crowd that he had been forced to rethink how he had done everything in China. You have to start from scratch, Mr. Kalanick said. He called the foray an amazing corporate and personal journey that reinforced the Uber belief in always improving and becoming a better version of yourself. In the shadows, Mr. Gurley smiled.

Farhad Manjoo      STATE OF THE ART  MARCH 22, 2017       Continue reading the main story  Share This Page   Continue reading the main story            Photo         Credit Doug Chayka     President Trump is not fond of regulations. Within weeks of taking office, he and his appointees began to roll back rules that govern the financial industry, guns, the energy business and broadband internet providers. Last week was the auto industrys turn. In a speech in Ypsilanti, Mich., Mr. Trump said he would alter rules imposed by the Obama administration to raise vehicles fuel standards, which are aimed at curbing greenhouse gases. The rules, Mr. Trump said, are killing jobs. Getting rid of them would prompt a resurgence in the auto industry that would make America the car capital of the world again, he said. Thats one possibility. We also have to consider another scenario: Loosening the fuel-economy rules could remove a primary incentive for big carmakers to catch up with innovative upstarts like Tesla and leave the American car industry out of step with a future ruled by electric motors rather than the internal combustion engine. This might happen because the effects of regulation are not as simple as Mr. Trump argues. The presidents view that rules almost always hurt businesses is not supported by history. Researchers who study regulation and its effects on business said there have been numerous instances in which regulation speeds along, rather than impedes, technological progress. It has happened in the energy business, the electronics industry and health care.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   And its happening now in cars. Vehicles powered by electricity keep getting better. Electric cars are getting less expensive, their range is increasing, and the infrastructure to sell, charge and maintain them is improving. As a result, electric cars keep getting more popular , even in a time of low gas prices. There are lots of reasons for this, but one above all: The whole industry is being pushed by regulation, both at the federal level and in the nine states that have adopted a zero-emission plan created by regulators in California.  Continue reading the main story         Advertisement   Continue reading the main story       Having long-term targets is driving investments in innovative technologies, said Don Anair, who studies the auto industry for the Union of Concerned Scientists, an environmental advocacy group. Maintaining those standards is critical for maintaining that progress. Car manufacturers disagree. A spokesman for the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers, a trade group that represents automakers on policy issues, said that regulations themselves are not spurring sales. Mandates are great at focusing attention on the development of a technology, said Wade Newton, a spokesman for the Alliance, in an email. But consumer acceptance of that technology is another thing. In a letter to the Environmental Protection Agency , the Alliance argued in February that Obama-era fuel economy rules would make cars more expensive, thus reducing sales and causing the loss of 1.1 million jobs. You might wonder why electric cars need help. If more efficient cars are so clearly better than their predecessors, shouldnt the market ensure their success? But thats not how technological progress typically works. New technologies  even ones that, on paper, look much better than old ones  usually start out at a severe disadvantage to the stuff theyre up against. The first personal computers were costlier and less powerful than early mainframes, for instance, and early digital cameras were not as good as film cameras.

Credit Stephen Crowley/The New York Times    Sometimes these technologies do not need a regulatory helping hand to get ahead. They merely get better with scale; the more that people bought digital cameras, the more manufacturers could invest in making better sensors, which became less expensive and offered better resolution, which in turn spurred sales, and on and on. Electric cars also depend on scale. Like the production of camera sensors and microprocessors, batteries and other components for electric cars also get less expensive when there is a mass market for these vehicles.

Gasoline engines are entrenched in the transportation economy. To make your electric car work correctly, you need an infrastructure to support it  you need ways to charge it, repair it, maintain it, resell it. In the absence of that ecosystem, switching to a car based on a fundamentally new tech platform, even if might offer benefits in the long run, is going to be hard  which means that car companies wont have much incentive to build it.

Traditionally, economists thought of regulation as a cost imposed by the government on companies. But in the 1990s, the economist Michael Porter argued that government rules could sometimes push industries to pursue technological innovations that they wouldnt have otherwise considered. In other words, regulations crafted in the right way could sometimes cost nothing  the rules would prompt innovations, attract new customers, and improve the industry over all. The idea took off among academics and regulators. Now its known as the Porter Hypothesis, and it has been shown to hold true in several studies across a wide range of industries. There is some good historical evidence that regulations have been a primary driver of innovation in the American car business. In the 1970s, the American government began imposing fuel economy standards on car manufacturers. Rather than harm the industry, the rules  which made cars smaller, safer and more fuel efficient  played a crucial role in helping the American car business beat back competition from European and Japanese imports. They also allowed American cars to become more globally competitive. So the new rules bore out the Porter Hypothesis  they didnt increase costs for consumers, but they improved cars. There is also evidence that when the government backs off the car industry, cars do not improve much. The average fuel economy of American cars soared from 1975 to around 1980, when regulators were pushing hardest. Then, beginning with Ronald Reagans presidency, the government eased off, and cars began to get less efficient. It was only after the government imposed new fuel economy rules  first under President George W. Bush and then under President Barack Obama  that the average fuel economy of vehicles on American roads began rising again . Today, the most important regulatory agency pushing the car industrys adoption of electric vehicles isnt the federal government. It is the California Air Resources Board, the state agency that manages Californias Zero Emission Vehicle program. The program , which has been adopted by nine other states, including New York, New Jersey, Connecticut and Massachusetts, outlines an escalating set of standards to encourage carmakers to create a market for electric cars. In 2018, about 4.5 percent of a companys sales in the covered states must be zero-emission vehicles (the cars can be fully electric, plug-in hybrids or powered by hydrogen fuel cell). By 2025, that rises to 22 percent. But the requirements are flexible. To meet the standards, car companies can decline to make electric vehicles and instead buy credits from other manufacturers; companies that sell more electric cars than the minimum standard can sell their extra credits. The resulting system has been a boon to upstarts like Tesla, which has sold hundreds of millions of dollars in credits . The rules have also given bigger companies an incentive to pursue electric vehicles. For instance, Chevrolet beat Tesla to market last year with a long-range electric car that sells for under $40,000, the Chevy Bolt. It did so partly to satisfy Californias rules; even if it does not make much money on each Bolt, selling the electric car will allow it to keep selling more profitable gas-powered cars. What were seeing is that the standard itself is creating an environment of competition, which is leading to rapid advances in electrification over the last seven years, said Mr. Anair of the Union of Concerned Scientists. But the California rules under which weve seen these advances were made possible by a federal waiver granted by the Obama administration. Some environmentalists now worry that the Trump administration could attempt to revoke that waiver  and with it, the nations best shot at moving beyond gas engines.

Credit Justin Lane/European Pressphoto Agency     An 82-year-old reputed mob figure who was acquitted in connection with the storied 1978 Lufthansa heist in 2015 was indicted again on Wednesday, this time along with John Gottis grandson, accused of conduct as petulant and petty as the $6 million robbery of the terminal at Kennedy Airport was grand: setting fire to the car of a motorist who had cut him off on the streets of Queens. And if the indignity of being charged in such a scheme wasnt bad enough, court papers describe its execution as so clumsy that had the elder John Gotti, a crime figure once known as the Teflon Don, not died in prison after a 1992 conviction he might well die now of shame. To make matters worse, one of two federal indictments unsealed in the case on Wednesday also charged the young mob scion, John J. Gotti, 23, and two other men with a bank robbery that appears on its face to be less than well thought through: The younger Mr. Gottis girlfriend, according to the court papers, worked as a teller at the bank branch. The three men, along with the aging, irascible Vincent Asaro, were all charged in United States District Court in Brooklyn with arson and arson conspiracy for setting fire to the car after the road rage episode in April 2012. Prosecutors from the United States attorneys office for the Eastern District of New York, who announced the case along with the F.B.I., identified Mr. Asaro as a powerful member of the Bonanno crime family for more than 30 years who they said has served in various leadership positions.

Continue reading the main story         Advertisement   Continue reading the main story       Mr. Asaro, who has a lengthy criminal history dating back to 1957, won a stunning courtroom victory in the Lufthansa case in November 2015, when a jury acquitted him of racketeering and other charges. That robbery figured prominently in the plot of the 1990 Martin Scorsese film Goodfellas. Elizabeth E. Macedonio, one of the lawyers who represented him in the 2015 trial, cited it when asked about the new charges. Hes faced a series of unfounded charges before and was vindicated, and he will do the same this time, she said.  Photo        John J. Gotti, 23, grandson of the crime figure once known as the Teflon Don.    Gerald Marrone, a lawyer for Mr. Gotti, could not be reached for comment on Tuesday night. A detention memo filed in the case against Mr. Asaro, Mr. Gotti and the two other men said that the older man became enraged at another motorist who switched lanes in front of Asaro at a traffic light in Howard Beach. Asaro chased the other vehicle for a period of time at a high rate of speed, the detention memo said. Later, Mr. Asaro sought the help of a mob associate in order to get the drivers address, then directed another to set fire to the motorists car, the memo said.

Mr. Gotti drove his own car, a Jaguar, for the crime, according to the memo, stopping at a gas station with the two other men in the early morning hours of April 4, 2012, to fill a container with gasoline. They drove to Broad Channel and located the car. One of the men doused it with gasoline and the other set it alight, the memo said. A police officer in an unmarked car witnessed the crime, and when the men saw him they fled in the Jaguar, with the officer in pursuit, the memo said. After a high-speed chase, the officer abandoned his pursuit because the Jaguar was driving so recklessly, it said.
