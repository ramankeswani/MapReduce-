Credit Doug Mills/The New York Times     WASHINGTON  Senators leading the investigation into Russian interference in the November election pledged on Wednesday to conduct an aggressive inquiry, including an examination of any ties to President Trump, as they sought to distance themselves from the flagging efforts in the House . In a conspicuous show of bipartisanship during a fractious time at the Capitol, the top Republican and Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee vowed to forge ahead by interviewing key players connected to Mr. Trump and pressing intelligence agencies to provide all relevant information. But their display of collegiality seemed intended primarily as a contrast to the explosive and often bewildering statements in recent days from the Republican chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, Representative Devin Nunes of California, whose perceived closeness with the Trump White House has raised doubts about his ability to conduct an impartial investigation. The chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, Richard M. Burr, Republican of North Carolina and a supporter of Mr. Trump during the campaign, suggested on Wednesday that he would not retreat from a process that could damage the reputation of a Republican president.

Continue reading the main story         Advertisement   Continue reading the main story       Asked later whether he had encountered any direct links between Mr. Trump and Russias interference, Mr. Burr was stern. We know that our challenge, he said, is to answer that question for the American people. The Senate investigation amounts to a credibility test for Republicans under the Trump administration  a chance to prove their willingness to ask uncomfortable questions of a Republican president, even if the answers might weaken his and the partys standing. Democrats are skeptical. But they are also mindful that the Senate most likely remains their best hope on Capitol Hill for gathering information, making them disinclined to abandon the Senate Intelligence Committees investigation. The F.B.I. is also investigating. On Wednesday, Mr. Burr and his Democratic counterpart on the committee, Senator Mark Warner of Virginia, offered some evidence of what they had reviewed so far, saying they had begun to schedule the first of at least 20 interviews. Mr. Warner drew attention to reports of perhaps 1,000 internet trolls in Russia generating fake news stories and targeting them at swing states like Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania. Russias goal, Vladimir Putins goal, is a weaker United States, he said.

Credit Doug Mills/The New York Times    Mr. Burr noted that Russians were now actively involved in the French elections. On Thursday, the committee will hold a public hearing on Russian influence on campaigns broadly. The two also left little doubt that they viewed the Houses unruly process as an afterthought, one that should not reflect on their own efforts.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   Let me set the ground rules real quick, Mr. Burr said before taking questions. Well answer anything about the Senate Intelligence Committees investigation. We will not take questions on the House Intelligence Committee. Mr. Burr could not suppress a smirk. Mr. Warner laughed outright. But the drama in the House has already complicated the Senates task, according to Senate committee members, leading the public to question congressional inquiries across the board. I worry that the chaos on the House side has affected the publics view on whether Congress can credibly investigate this matter, said Senator Susan Collins, Republican of Maine and a committee member. I believe the answer to that is still yes, and that the Senate is the place. Lamenting the debacle in the House, Senator Kamala Harris, Democrat of California and another committee member, said she believed that the public is now shifting to us. The congressional investigations are not related, but their focuses overlap, leaving the Senate panel to defend itself in the face of Mr. Nuness assorted claims. While a vast majority of Republicans in the House have stood by Mr. Nunes amid calls for him to recuse himself, his furtive maneuvering  including bypassing his committee to brief the White House about relevant intelligence  has placed House committee members in a difficult spot. And at least one Republican lawmaker, Representative Charlie Dent of Pennsylvania, suggested on Wednesday that the Senate should take the lead on Congresss investigation into ties between the presidents orbit and Russia. The Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky, has long resisted calls for a special prosecutor or select committee, saying the Senate could do the job through regular protocol. On the House side, a string of perplexing decisions by Mr. Nunes has threatened to unravel the panels investigation altogether. Last week, he abruptly announced that he had obtained information indicating that people associated with the Trump transition may have been incidentally caught up in legal surveillance of foreign operatives. He also bypassed the committees top Democrat, Representative Adam B. Schiff of California, to brief Mr. Trump.

Comey, but also by the heads of the Senate and House investigations, including Mr. Nunes.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   Another obstacle to bipartisanship came on Monday, with the revelation that Mr. Nunes had viewed what he characterized as dozens of reports containing classified information on the grounds of the White House. Democrats fumed, their suspicions fueled by speculation that the source of Mr. Nuness information was a Trump administration official and that Mr. Nunes may have even coordinated with the White House. While Mr. Nunes defended himself by saying that he needed to be at the White House to view the sensitive documents in question, one can peruse sensitive information at the Capitol and at other spots around Washington. Democrats have also chafed at Mr. Nuness shuffling of the hearing schedule. Earlier this month, with Mr. Schiff by his side, Mr. Nunes announced plans for three former officials to testify, a group that would include Sally Q. Yates, who briefly served as acting attorney general and alerted the administration that Michael T. Flynn, Mr. Trumps former national security adviser, appeared to have lied about his contact with Russian officials. Last week, Mr. Nunes scrapped that public hearing, arguing that the committee first needed more time to question intelligence leaders. But on Tuesday he said this hearing had been postponed as well  as Th e Washington Post reported that White House officials had tried to stymie Ms. Yatess testimony. Democrats have accused Mr. Nunes of trying to stall not only the investigation but also the committee as a whole. Mr. Warner said on Wednesday that he would like to see Ms. Yates at some point before his committee. At the same time, the Senate investigation has not been blemish-free. Last month, Mr. Warner publicly scolded Mr. Burr after reports that Mr. Burr had spoken with the White House and engaged with news organizations to dispute reports that Trump associates had been in consistent contact with Russian intelligence operatives. In an emailed statement on Wednesday, Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader, took care to praise Mr. Warner  though not Mr. Burr  as he expressed confidence in the Senate inquiry.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   Mark Warner realizes the importance of the task in front of him, and is pursuing it diligently and smartly, Mr. Schumer said. That gives the Democrats a lot of faith that the process on the Senate side can work.   At the news conference, Mr. Burr said that contrary to maybe popular belief, he and Mr. Warner were partners. And he insisted that his party allegiance would not supersede the duties of his office. Ill do something Ive never done: Ill admit that I voted for him, Mr. Burr said of Mr. Trump. But Ive got a job in the United States Senate.   Get politics and Washington news updates via Facebook , Twitter and in the Morning Briefing newsletter .

Now the company has introduced the De Grisogono Botler , a Facebook Messenger application that delivers real-time advice and insider tips about the Swiss resort of St. Moritz. The ski destination is a beloved haunt of Fawaz Gruosi , the houses founder and creative director, and the Botler is designed around his lifestyle and artistic inspirations.

Credit Doug Mills/The New York Times     WASHINGTON  A pair of White House officials helped provide Representative Devin Nunes of California, a Republican and the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, with the intelligence reports that showed that President Trump and his associates were incidentally swept up in foreign surveillance by American spy agencies. The revelation on Thursday that White House officials disclosed the reports, which Mr. Nunes then discussed with Mr. Trump, is likely to fuel criticism that the intelligence chairman has been too eager to do the bidding of the Trump administration while his committee is supposed to be conducting an independent investigation of Russias meddling in the presidential election. It is the latest twist of a bizarre Washington drama that began after dark on March 21, when Mr. Nunes got a call from a person he has described only as a source. The call came as he was riding across town in an Uber car, and he quickly diverted to the White House. The next day, Mr. Nunes gave a hastily arranged news conference before going to brief Mr. Trump on what he had learned the night before from  as it turns out  White House officials. The chain of events  and who helped provide the intelligence to Mr. Nunes  was detailed to The New York Times by four American officials.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   Since disclosing the existence of the intelligence reports, Mr. Nunes has refused to identify his sources, saying he needed to protect them so others would feel safe going to the committee with sensitive information. In his public comments, he has described his sources as whistle-blowers trying to expose wrongdoing at great risk to themselves.   Amid Trump Inquiry, a Primer on Surveillance Practices and Privacy           The F.B.I. investigation into possible Trump campaign coordination with Russia and claims by the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee raise questions.         That does not appear to be the case. Several current American officials identified the White House officials as Ezra Cohen-Watnick, the senior director for intelligence at the National Security Council, and Michael Ellis, a lawyer who works on national security issues at the White House Counsels Office and was previously counsel to Mr. Nuness committee. Though neither has been accused of breaking any laws, they do appear to have sought to use intelligence to advance the political goals of the Trump administration.  Continue reading the main story         Advertisement   Continue reading the main story       Sean Spicer, the White House spokesman, refused to confirm or deny at his daily briefing that Mr. Ellis and Mr. Cohen-Watnick were Mr. Nuness sources. The administrations concern was the substance of the intelligence reports, not how they ended up in Mr. Nuness hands, Mr. Spicer said. The obsession with who talked to whom, and when, is not the answer, Mr. Spicer said. It should be the substance. Jack Langer, a spokesman for Mr. Nunes, said in a statement, As hes stated many times, Chairman Nunes will not confirm or deny speculation about his sources identity, and he will not respond to speculation from anonymous sources. Mr. Cohen-Watnick, 30, is a former Defense Intelligence Agency official who served on the Trump transition team and was originally brought to the White House by Michael T. Flynn, the former national security adviser. He was nearly pushed out of his job this month by Lt. Gen. H. R. McMaster, who replaced Mr. Flynn as national security adviser, but survived after the intervention of Jared Kushner, the presidents son-in-law, and Stephen K. Bannon, Mr. Trumps chief strategist.  Photo        Representative Adam B. Schiff of California, the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, said he accepted an invitation on Thursday to review the same materials that Mr. Nunes had seen.   Credit Gabriella Demczuk for The New York Times    The officials who detailed the newly disclosed White House role said that this month, shortly after Mr. Trump claimed on Twitter that he was wiretapped during the campaign on the orders of President Barack Obama, Mr. Cohen-Watnick began reviewing highly classified reports detailing the intercepted communications of foreign officials.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   There were conflicting accounts of what prompted Mr. Cohen-Watnick to dig into the intelligence. One official with direct knowledge of the events said Mr. Cohen-Watnick began combing through intelligence reports this month in an effort to find evidence that would justify Mr. Trumps Twitter posts about wiretapping. But another person who was briefed on the events said Mr. Cohen-Watnick came upon the information as he was reviewing how widely intelligence reports on intercepts were shared within the American spy agencies. He then alerted the N.S.C. general counsel, but the official said Mr. Cohen-Watnick was not the person who showed the reports to Mr. Nunes. That person and a third official said it was then Mr. Ellis who allowed Mr. Nunes to view the material. The intelligence reports consisted primarily of ambassadors and other foreign officials talking about how they were trying to develop contacts within Mr. Trumps family and inner circle before his inauguration, officials said. The officials all spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe the intelligence and to avoid angering Mr. Cohen-Watnick and Mr. Ellis. Officials say Mr. Cohen-Watnick has been reviewing the reports from his fourth-floor office in the Eisenhower Executive Office Building, where the National Security Council is based.

According to Mr. Nunes, who served on the Trump transition team, he met his source on the grounds of the White House. He said he needed a secure location where people with security clearances could legally view classified information, though such facilities could also be found in the Capitol building and at other locations across Washington. The next day, Mr. Nunes gave a news briefing at the Capitol and then returned to the White House to brief Mr. Trump on the information before telling other committee members about what he had reviewed. His actions have fueled criticism that the committee, under his leadership, is unable to conduct a serious, independent investigation.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   On Thursday, Representative Adam B. Schiff of California, the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, said he needed clarification on whether White House officials had pursued a circuitous route to feed Mr. Nunes the materials so he could then hand them to Mr. Trump. If that was designed to hide the origin of the materials, that raises profound questions about just what the White House is doing that need to be answered, he said. He later said he accepted an invitation on Thursday to review the same materials that Mr. Nunes had seen. Yet even before Thursday, the view among Democrats and even some Republicans was that Mr. Nunes was given access to the intelligence reports to divert attention from the investigations into Russian meddling, and to bolster Mr. Trumps debunked claims of having been wiretapped.  Video   G.O.P. Intelligence Chairman Apologizes    Representative Devin Nunes put the credibility of the House Intelligence Committee in doubt after bypassing committee Democrats and taking information straight to the president.  By MICHAEL S. SCHMIDT and SUSAN JOAN ARCHER.  Photo by Gabriella Demczuk for The New York Times.  Watch in Times Video          embed            On both counts, Mr. Nunes appears to have succeeded: The House inquiry into Russian meddling that he is leading has descended into a sideshow since he disclosed the information, and the administration has portrayed his information as vindicating the presidents wiretapping claims. Yet Mr. Nunes has dismissed Democratic calls to step aside . Instead, he has canceled all committee hearings for now, stalling his own investigation, which opened last week with a hearing during which James B. Comey, the director of the F.B.I., publicly disclosed that the bureaus investigation into Russian meddling included an examination of any evidence that Trump associates had colluded in the effort. The chaotic situation prompted the leaders of the Senate Intelligence Committee, which is running its own investigation, to bluntly state on Wednesday that their work had nothing to do with the House inquiry. And television news programs have been dominated by arguments about whether the incidental intelligence gathering of Mr. Trump and his associates was the real issue, or simply a distraction from the Russia investigations. Mr. Nunes has acknowledged that the incidental intelligence gathering on Trump associates last year was not necessarily unlawful, and that it was not specifically directed at Mr. Trump or people close to him. American intelligence agencies typically monitor foreign officials of allied and hostile countries, and they routinely sweep up communications linked to Americans who may be taking part in the conversation or are being spoken about.   The real issue, Mr. Nunes has said, was that he could figure out the identities of Trump associates from reading reports about intercepted communications that were shared among Obama administration officials with top security clearances. He said some Trump associates were also identified by name in the reports. Normally, intelligence agencies mask the identities of American citizens who are incidentally present in intercepted communications, though knowledgeable readers can often figure out the identities in context.

Credit Sam Hodgson for The New York Times     WASHINGTON  Paul Manafort, who served as President Trumps campaign manager and is under scrutiny for his ties to Russia , will testify before the House Intelligence Committee, the panels chairman said on Friday. The chairman, Representative Devin Nunes, Republican of California, said Mr. Manafort had volunteered to appear before the committee as it conducts its own investigation into Russian interference in the election. Jason Maloni, Mr. Manaforts spokesman, confirmed the announcement. Mr. Manafort instructed his representatives to reach out to committee staff and offer to provide information voluntarily regarding recent allegations about Russian interference in the election, Mr. Maloni said in a statement. As Mr. Manafort has always maintained, he looks forward to meeting with those conducting serious investigations of these issues to discuss the facts. Mr. Manafort has offered to appear before the Senate Intelligence Committee as well, according to a Senate official who requested anonymity to discuss committee business.

Putin.  Continue reading the main story         Advertisement   Continue reading the main story       It is unclear when Mr. Manafort will testify before either committee. A considerable amount of preparation is required before such hearings, including research and interviewing other witnesses. And considering the serious questions surrounding Mr. Manaforts connections, Democratic lawmakers in particular will want to take their time preparing. Evidence that heightened suspicions about Mr. Manafort emerged this week, when a member of Ukraines Parliament released documents showing that the former Trump adviser had tried to hide payments connected to his work for the former president of Ukraine, Viktor F. Yanukovych, apparently by funneling some money through an offshore account and masking it as payment for computers.

The Associated Press also reported that, before working for Mr. Trump, Mr. Manafort had secretly worked for a Russian billionaire, Oleg Deripaska, to promote Mr. Putins government in the United States, offering strategies to sway politics, news coverage and business deals. It was Mr. Manaforts questionable ties to Russia that ended his stint running Mr. Trumps campaign. Days after The New York Times reported in August that he was designated to collect $12.7 million in undisclosed, potentially illegal payments from a pro-Russia political party in Ukraine, Mr. Manafort resigned from the campaign . Mr. Manafort worked for the campaign for about five months, in particular as a strategist hired to help woo delegates . He had been known in recent years for his international political work. In a decision that Democrats immediately rebuked, Mr. Nunes said on Friday that he would replace a scheduled public hearing with former intelligence and law enforcement officials with a closed-door proceeding to hear from the directors of the F.B.I. and the National Security Agency. Those officials, James B. Comey and Adm. Michael S. Rogers, testified in a public hearing before the committee on Monday. Representative Adam B. Schiff of California, the House panels top Democrat, denounced Mr. Nunes for canceling the hearing, which was scheduled for Tuesday, with James R. Clapper Jr., the former director of national intelligence; John O. Brennan, the former C.I.A. director; and Sally Q. Yates, who served as acting attorney general in January.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   Calling it an attempt to choke off public information, Mr. Schiff said Mr. Nunes had scuttled the hearing under pressure from the White House after Mondays hearing. Despite frustrations with Mr. Nuness recent decisions, Democrats welcomed the opportunity to question Mr. Manafort. Democrats feel that if were not engaged in this investigation, no one will be, Mr. Schiff said in a news conference at the Capitol. And there are some, Im sure, in this building who would like nothing more than this investigation to go away. From my point of view, that would be irresponsible of us.

Fink, the chief of BlackRock, has become convinced that the company must bet big on the power of machines., be it Aladdin, the firms risk management platform; robo-advisers; big data; or even artificial intelligence.   Credit Damon Winter/The New York Times     Score one for the machines. The largest fund company in the world, BlackRock, has faced a thorny challenge since it acquired the exchange-traded-fund business from Barclays in 2009. These low cost, computer-driven funds have exploded in growth, leaving in the dust the stock pickers who had spurred an earlier expansion for the firm. The rise of passive investing  exchange-traded funds, index funds and the like  has revolutionized the investment world, providing Main Street investors with greater opportunities at lower fees while putting pressure on even Wall Streets biggest money managers. Now, after years of deliberations, Laurence D. Fink, a founder and chief executive of BlackRock, has cast his lot with the machines. On Tuesday, BlackRock laid out an ambitious plan to consolidate a large number of actively managed mutual funds with peers that rely more on algorithms and models to pick stocks.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   The initiative is the most explicit action by a major fund management firm in reaction to the exodus of investors from actively managed stock funds to cheaper funds that track every variety of index and investment theme.  Continue reading the main story         Advertisement   Continue reading the main story       Some $30 billion in assets (about 11 percent of active equity funds) will be targeted, with $6 billion rebranded BlackRock Advantage funds. These funds focus on quantitative and other strategies that adopt a more rules-based approach to investing. The democratization of information has made it much harder for active management, Mr. Fink said in an interview. We have to change the ecosystem  that means relying more on big data, artificial intelligence, factors and models within quant and traditional investment strategies. As part of the restructuring, seven of BlackRocks 53 stock pickers are expected to step down from their funds. Several of the money managers will stay on as advisers. At least 36 employees connected to the funds are leaving the firm. While BlackRock is proceeding gradually, in many ways the new plan is a direct attack on the cult of the brainy mutual fund manager, popularized in the 1980s and 1990s by Peter Lynch, a stock-picking wizard at the fund giant Fidelity. Today, asset managers like Pimco, Franklin Templeton, Aberdeen and, of course, Fidelity continue to make the case that their bond and equity managers can outsmart the broader market  and charge a premium price for doing so. Since 2009, however, as the performance of these funds has suffered, millions of investors have rejected this proposition, abandoning their expensive mutual funds for better-performing funds that track various indexes at a fraction of the cost. Now the biggest fund companies are Vanguard, the indexing pioneer, and BlackRock, which together oversee close to $10 trillion in assets.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   BlackRock, with its fleet of iShares E.T.F.s, has certainly benefited from the investor revolution  one that threatens to disrupt the mutual fund industry in the years ahead. Still, the monster in the mutual fund room by far has been Vanguard, which, via index funds and exchange-traded funds, has had historic inflows. Last year, for example, $423 billion left actively managed stock funds and $390 billion poured into index funds, according to Morningstar. Of that amount, Vanguard captured $277 billion, nearly tripling the amount that went to its nearest rival, BlackRock.

Let the client choose has long been his mantra. Left unsaid has been the reality that at his root Mr. Fink is now a true believer in systematic investing styles that favor algorithms, science and data-reliant models over the stock picking smarts of individual portfolio managers. In recent years he has hired Andrew Ang, a star finance professor from Columbia , to push BlackRock into factor-based investing, a theme-based approach to allocating assets. And since last year, BlackRocks dyed-in-the-wool stock pickers have worked in the same division as its quants. These managers, many of whom have Ph.D.s, might buy (or sell) Walmarts stock on the basis of a satellite feed that reveals how many cars are in its parking lots as opposed to an insight gleaned from the innards of the retailers balance sheet. In sum, Mr. Fink has become convinced that BlackRock must bet big on the power of machines, be it Aladdin, the firms risk management platform, robo-advisers , big data or even artificial intelligence. Just about any interview or conference call with Mr. Fink bears this out: Invariably, the conversation comes around to technology, with scant mention of what the firms stock pickers are doing.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   But simply going all-in on machine-driven passive investing over active has not been an option for Mr. Fink. While the assets of the firms actively managed stock funds have shrunk to $201 billion today from $208 billion in 2009, the business is still very profitable for BlackRock, representing 16 percent of total revenue. According to data from Morningstar, only 11 percent of BlackRocks actively managed equity funds have beaten their benchmarks since 2009. Since 2012, $27.5 billion has left BlackRock actively managed mutual funds, per Morningstar data. The new push, which is being overseen by Mark Wiseman, a top executive at Canadas top pension fund whom Mr. Fink hired last year to revamp his equity business, highlights strategies in which a portfolio manager makes big bets on a select group of stocks. Still, there is no mistaking the larger message: Expensive, actively managed funds looking to make a mark picking United States stocks must adapt to the new realities at BlackRock. Take BlackRocks Large Cap Core fund, which invests in big American companies. Since 2009, the funds assets have halved, to $1.5 billion, trailing the index by 1.3 percent over the last three years. The funds lead manager will be replaced by three portfolio experts from BlackRocks quantitative investing team, where all varieties of computer models are crunched in pursuit of stock picking ideas. Fees will also be halved.   Of course, none of these moves are likely to immediately halt the outflows of the past years. In fact outflows are likely to increase, as few investors want to stick with a fund undergoing an existential makeover. But as Mr. Fink and his new equity deputy see it, it is better to take the pain now than later. The old way of people sitting in a room picking stocks, thinking they are smarter than the next guy  that does not work anymore, Mr. Wiseman said. These are stormy seas for active managers, but we at BlackRock are an aircraft carrier, and we are going to chart our way through these seas.

After over a decade in the House, he now finds himself in the spotlight.   Credit Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images     WASHINGTON  Even on Fox News, Representative Devin Nunes, the beleaguered Republican chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, could not escape the venom from his left. Mr. Nunes, the California lawmaker, stood inside the Capitols Statuary Hall on Thursday evening, assuming a familiar set of positions: in front of a camera, giving cover to President Trump and defending himself. The subject this time was his decision on Wednesday to brief Mr. Trump, whose campaign his committee is investigating, about possible incidental surveillance of the president or his associates. I still think its the right call, Mr. Nunes said of his decision not to tell members of his committee about his trip to the White House. But as he spoke inside the Capitol, a committee colleague, Representative Jim Himes, Democrat of Connecticut, peered into a different camera, belonging to CNN, a few feet to the left. It is almost inconceivable, Mr. Himes said of his chairmans behavior, more than loud enough to hear nearby. Lo and behold, a couple of hours later, Donald Trump gets to put the barest of fig leaves on the outrageous tweet about Barack Obama wiretapping him.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   Since Mr. Trump took office, Mr. Nunes has proved an eager purveyor of executive fig leaves. As the leader of an investigation involving the campaign of a man he cheered vocally and served directly as a transition team official, the congressman has often appeared almost incurious about the chief subject of the inquiry.  Continue reading the main story         Advertisement   Continue reading the main story       Of greater concern in the intelligence sphere is his recent burst of media exposure, with a public speaking style that can at times seem cavalier while discussing sensitive information. This has led to misgivings about sharing national security details with him, a senior American intelligence official said. Many lawmakers crave attention, racing to microphones and pounding lecterns in search of cable news glory. But Mr. Nunes, who can seem by turns earnest and reticent in person, is something different: After over a decade in the House, he has appeared to lurch haphazardly into the spotlight, like Kramer entering a room on Seinfeld, straining to keep his balance as a human shield in Washingtons daily Trump wars. Mr. Nunes said on Fox News that he felt he had a duty and obligation to tell Mr. Trump about the possible surveillance. Because as you know, hes taking a lot of heat in the news media. Now the president has company in that regard: Mr. Nunes, a former dairy farmer, elected to Congress in 2002 at age 29, from a deep-red section of a deep-blue state. The Democratic National Committee has even adopted a new label for him: White House stooge. It was not always thus. Mr. Nunes was 23 when he was first elected to public office, as a board member of a local community college where he had started his higher education. Eyeing his first campaign, Mr. Nunes sought advice from Representative Jim Costa, a Democrat who is also from the Central Valley in California and was serving in the State Legislature at the time. Both belonged to the areas tight-knit Portuguese community. Mr. Costa said he recognized a familiar drive. We all show that kind of interest when were in our 20s and 30s, and we want to try to get an opportunity to see if we can make a difference, Mr. Costa said. Until recently, Mr. Nuness most memorable flourish in the House was his blistering assessment in 2013 of Republicans who were willing to shut down the federal government over President Obamas health law:  lemmings with suicide vests .   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   Now, he has largely retained the support of his colleagues, despite complaints from Republicans like Senator John McCain of Arizona over his committee stewardship, amplifying calls for an independent commission to investigate Mr. Trumps connections to Russia.

Mr. Nunes also announced the cancellation of a public meeting with former intelligence and law enforcement leaders, citing a desire to bring in James B. Comey, the F.B.I. director, and Michael S. Rogers, the head of the National Security Agency, for a closed session instead. Both testified before the committee this week. Representative Adam Schiff of California, the committees top Democrat, suggested that once again the chairman had acted unilaterally, this time to scuttle the hearing. And in a sign of how far their relationship has fallen, Mr. Schiff  who for weeks stood by Mr. Nuness side before reporters and defended him  accused him of taking that action because the White House had told him to. This was the capper to an eventful few days for Mr. Nunes. Presiding over a committee hearing on Monday  when Mr. Comey took the extraordinary step of announcing the agencys investigation into whether the Trump campaign had colluded with Russia to influence the 2016 election  Mr. Nunes mustered deeper alarm over anonymous sources revealing an inquirys details to journalists than over the contents of the investigation. On Wednesday, he told reporters he had received information that Mr. Trump or members of his team may have been incidentally swept up in foreign surveillance by American spy agencies. Pressed on whether the White House had provided him the information to produce a feedback loop that might aid the president, Mr. Nunes has declined to reveal his sources, saying he does not want to discourage others from coming forward  a rationale analogous to reporters arguments for protecting anonymous sources. It has also not always been entirely clear what Mr. Nunes is talking about. Was the president also part of that incidental collection, his communications? one reporter asked on Wednesday. Yes, Mr. Nunes said, after glancing at the floor for a moment. Heads snapped up from their phones and notepads. Excuse me, let me just clarify, another reporter began. The president of the United States personal communications were intercepted as an incidental part of intelligence gathering  Mr. Nunes appeared to reconsider. When we talk about intelligence products here, weve got to be very careful, he said.

He has said he could decipher the identities of Trump associates from reading reports about intercepted communications that were shared among Obama administration officials with top security clearances. But he has stressed that he did not have evidence to support Mr. Trumps claim of being personally wiretapped. Regardless, the president and some allies have seized on the comments as validation. I mean, look, my guess is theres probably a lot more than what I was able to see, Mr. Nunes said, when asked if Mr. Trump was indeed vindicated. And then hell have to make up his own mind. Democrats have said that Mr. Nunes apologized for leaving them out of the loop. Mr. Nunes, who said he would not do anything differently if given the chance, said he understood why some were upset. But he chafed at discussions of his private conversations. That stuff, he said, is not supposed to leak out.   Michael S. Schmidt contributed reporting.

Automakers are the biggest users of industrial robots, which have decreased employment and wages in local economies.   Credit Bill Pugliano/Getty Images     Who is winning the race for jobs between robots and humans? Last year, two leading economists described a future in which humans come out ahead. But now theyve declared a different winner: the robots. The industry most affected by automation is manufacturing. For every robot per thousand workers, up to six workers lost their jobs and wages fell by as much as three-fourths of a percent, according to a new paper by the economists, Daron Acemoglu of M.I.T. and Pascual Restrepo of Boston University. It appears to be the first study to quantify large, direct, negative effects of robots. The paper is all the more significant because the researchers, whose work is highly regarded in their field, had been more sanguine about the effect of technology on jobs. In a paper last year , they said it was likely that increased automation would create new, better jobs, so employment and wages would eventually return to their previous levels. Just as cranes replaced dockworkers but created related jobs for engineers and financiers, the theory goes, new technology has created new jobs for software developers and data analysts. But that paper was a conceptual exercise. The new one uses real-world data  and suggests a more pessimistic future. The researchers said they were surprised to see very little employment increase in other occupations to offset the job losses in manufacturing. That increase could still happen, they said, but for now there are large numbers of people out of work, with no clear path forward  especially blue-collar men without college degrees.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   The conclusion is that even if overall employment and wages recover, there will be losers in the process, and its going to take a very long time for these communities to recover, Mr. Acemoglu said.  Continue reading the main story         Advertisement   Continue reading the main story       If youve worked in Detroit for 10 years, you dont have the skills to go into health care, he said. The market economy is not going to create the jobs by itself for these workers who are bearing the brunt of the change. The papers evidence of job displacement from technology contrasts with a comment from the Treasury secretary, Steve Mnuchin, who said at an Axios event last week that artificial intelligences displacement of human jobs was not even on our radar screen, and 50 to 100 more years away. (Not all robots use artificial intelligence, but a panel of experts  polled by the M.I.T. Initiative on the Digital Economy in reaction to Mr. Mnuchins comments  expressed the same broad concern of major job displacement.) The paper also helps explain a mystery that has been puzzling economists: why, if machines are replacing human workers, productivity hasnt been increasing. In manufacturing, productivity has been increasing more than elsewhere  and now we see evidence of it in the employment data, too. The study analyzed the effect of industrial robots in local labor markets in the United States. Robots are to blame for up to 670,000 lost manufacturing jobs between 1990 and 2007, it concluded, and that number will rise because industrial robots are expected to quadruple. The paper adds to the evidence that automation, more than other factors like trade and offshoring that President Trump campaigned on, has been the bigger long-term threat to blue-collar jobs. The researchers said the findings  large and robust negative effects of robots on employment and wages  remained strong even after controlling for imports, offshoring, software that displaces jobs, worker demographics and the type of industry.

The data doesnt explain why, but Mr. Acemoglu had a guess: Women are more willing than men to take a pay cut to work in a lower-status field. The economists looked at the effect of robots on local economies and also more broadly. In an isolated area, each robot per thousand workers decreased employment by 6.2 workers and wages by 0.7 percent. But nationally, the effects were smaller, because jobs were created in other places. Take Detroit, home to automakers, the biggest users of industrial robots. Employment was greatly affected. If automakers can charge less for cars because they employ fewer people, employment might increase elsewhere in the country, like at steel makers or taxi operators. Meanwhile, the people in Detroit will probably spend less at stores. Including these factors, each robot per thousand workers decreased employment by three workers and wages by 0.25 percent.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   The findings fuel the debate about whether technology will help people do their jobs more efficiently and create new ones, as it has in the past, or eventually displace humans. David Autor, a collaborator of Mr. Acemoglus at M.I.T., has argued that machines will complement instead of replace humans, and cannot replicate human traits like common sense and empathy. I dont think that this paper is the last word on its subject, but its an exceedingly carefully constructed and thought-provoking first word, he said. Mr. Restrepo said the problem might be that the new jobs created by technology are not in the places that are losing jobs, like the Rust Belt. I still believe there will be jobs in the years to come, though probably not as many as we have today, he said. But the data have made me worried about the communities directly exposed to robots. In addition to cars, industrial robots are used most in the manufacturing of electronics, metal products, plastics and chemicals. They do not require humans to operate, and do various tasks like welding, painting and packaging. From 1993 to 2007, the United States added one new industrial robot for every thousand workers  mostly in the Midwest, South and East  and Western Europe added 1.6.   The study, a National Bureau of Economic Research working paper published Monday, used data on the number of robots from the International Federation of Robotics (there is no consistent data on the monetary value of the robots in use.) It analyzed the effect of robots on employment and wages in commuting zones, a way to measure local economies. The next question is whether the coming wave of technologies  like machine learning, drones and driverless cars  will have similar effects, but on many more people.

Trumps presidential campaign staff and the Russian government, perhaps even influencing the 2016 election. When James B. Comey, the F.B.I. director, went before Congress on March 20 and confirmed the existence of the Trump-Russia investigation, it echoed of the Cold War investigations in which the bureau and the C.I.A. searched for agents hidden in the government who had spied for Moscow. A look back at those Cold War cases may reveal lessons for todays investigators. Above all, those past cases show it could take years before the new investigation uncovers any answers. It starts with an unexplained incident.  Photo        The taxi phone on Kastanayevskaya Street in the Moscow suburbs where Paul Stombaugh was ambushed in June 1985.    Spy hunts usually begin with an unexplained incident . In the Trump-Russia case, there was the hacking of the D.N.C.s computers. In 1985, there was an arrest on the streets of Moscow.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   In June 1985, Burton Gerber, the chief of the Soviet-East European division of the Central Intelligence Agency, was about to sit down to dinner at his home in Washington when he received devastating news. Paul Stombaugh, a C.I.A. case officer, had just been arrested by the K.G.B. in Moscow. Mr. Stombaugh had been caught while he was on a clandestine mission to meet the C.I.A.s most important Russian spy, Adolf Tolkachev, a scientist at a secret military design facility who had been providing the Americans with top-secret information about Soviet weapons systems. Mr. Gerber knew that Mr. Stombaughs arrest meant that Mr. Tolkachev, an agent the C.I.A. had code-named GTVANQUISH, had certainly been arrested as well.  Continue reading the main story         Advertisement   Continue reading the main story       The arrest and subsequent execution of Mr. Tolkachev was the most damaging of a series of mysterious spy losses suffered by the C.I.A. in 1985. In fact, there was so much espionage activity between the C.I.A. and the K.G.B. that burst into public view in 1985 that it became known as the Year of the Spy. But why? Debate swirled inside the cloistered world of American counterintelligence. Could all the spy losses be blamed on C.I.A. incompetence? Or had they resulted from something more sinister, like a Russian mole inside the agency? That 1985 debate has in some ways been mirrored in the public debate about the hacking of the D.N.C. during the 2016 presidential campaign. Did some hacker simply take advantage of the committees cyber-incompetence, or was an American political party the specific and premeditated target of Russian intelligence? A mosaic of clues creates a trail.  Photo        The identification and business card of the former F.B.I. agent Robert Hanssen.   Credit Paul J. Richards/Agence France-Presse  Getty Images    It took years for counterintelligence officials at the C.I.A. and the F.B.I. to put the pieces together and finally solve the puzzle of 1985. Eventually, they realized that they had been confused because there were so many investigative threads to try to follow at once. For example, in August 1985  just two months after Mr. Stombaughs arrest  a K.G.B. officer, Vitaly Yurchenko, defected to the United States, and identified a C.I.A. officer, Edward Lee Howard, as a Russian spy. Mr. Howard escaped to Russia, and Mr. Yurchenko then redefected to Moscow. American officials were left to wonder whether Mr. Howard had been responsible for the spy losses  and if Mr. Yurchenkos defection had been genuine or whether he had been ordered by the K.G.B. to defect in order to point them toward Mr. Howard and confuse the Americans. Ultimately, the C.I.A. and the F.B.I. discovered that it had been difficult to determine what was causing all of the losses because the Russians had more than one mole hidden in the United States government. Both Aldrich Ames, a C.I.A. case officer, and Robert Hanssen, an F.B.I. agent, began spying for the Soviets in 1985. Both gave Moscow the names of Soviets working for the United States, but Mr. Ames and Mr. Hanssen didnt give the Russians the same exact information. It was only after Mr. Ames was arrested in 1994 that counterintelligence officials realized there had to be another mole, because Mr. Ames had not known certain things that had been compromised, including the existence of an espionage investigation of a State Department official, Felix Bloch. After Mr. Ames was arrested, the United States secretly began a new mole hunt, which ultimately led to the arrest of Mr. Hanssen in 2001.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   Thus, the counterintelligence investigations into the 1985 losses lasted 16 years. Like their Cold War predecessors, American counterintelligence investigators today face the daunting task of trying to unravel myriad business and personal connections between the Russian government and other Russian entities and people associated with the Trump campaign. It is certain to take officials time to determine which connections are the most significant to their investigation.

Photo        F.B.I. agents in 2001 at the Vienna, Va., home of Mr. Hanssen, an F.B.I. agent who gave Moscow the names of Soviets working for the United States.   Credit Doug Mills/Associated Press    Counterintelligence investigations are conducted jointly by the C.I.A. and the F.B.I., with support from other agencies like the National Security Agency. Today, the new Trump-Russia investigation is being conducted by a joint interagency task force, as were the spy hunts of the Cold War. But interagency counterintelligence operations are often bogged down by competition over jurisdiction, which can lead to frustrating bureaucratic delays and sometimes missed opportunities. Turf wars badly slowed the investigation of Mr. Hanssen and allowed him to continue to spy until long after the Cold War. For years, the F.B.I. was convinced that the mole they were hunting was another C.I.A. officer like Mr. Ames, and refused to believe it was possible that an F.B.I. agent was a traitor. Their fixation on the C.I.A. led investigators to focus on Brian J. Kelley, a longtime C.I.A. counterintelligence officer. The F.B.I.s obsession with Mr. Kelley was reinforced because of a series of incredible similarities between his life and Mr. Hanssens. Mr. Kelley, like Mr. Hanssen, had known about the investigation of Mr. Bloch. Mr. Kelley lived on a street in Vienna, Va., where Mr. Hanssen had once lived while he was a Russian spy, and Mr. Kelley jogged in Nottoway Park in Vienna, the same park where Mr. Hanssen arranged a series of dead-drops with the K.G.B. An F.B.I. team covertly broke into Mr. Kelleys house and found a map of Nottoway Park with Xs marked on it, which the F.B.I. was convinced was Mr. Kelleys spy map. When they later confronted Mr. Kelley with the map, he asked them, Where did you get my jogging map? It turned out that he liked to time his runs from point to point in the park.

Credit Denis Paquin/Associated Press    Almost every major spy case is finally solved thanks to defectors from the other side. The lengthy counterintelligence investigation into Mr. Ames was aided by a Russian spy, code-named AVENGER, who provided critical information that pointed toward Mr. Ames. The Hanssen case was also finally solved with the help of a Russian spy who brought out K.G.B. files that helped identify Mr. Hanssen. The C.I.A. and the F.B.I. do not like to admit that they rely so heavily on defectors to solve their cases. But it is possible that the Trump-Russia case may not be cracked until the C.I.A. or the F.B.I. persuades a Russian intelligence officer to change sides and provide incriminating information. But in such a highly politicized case that has the potential to change history, a Russian defector will be met with enormous skepticism, even inside the counterintelligence world. Probably the closest Cold War parallel is the bitter case of Yuri Nosenko. Mr. Nosenko was a K.G.B. officer who defected to the C.I.A. in 1964 and brought with him the answer to one of the biggest mysteries of modern times: Was the Soviet Union responsible for the assassination of President John F. Kennedy? At the time, the C.I.A. was not certain, since Lee Harvey Oswald had defected to Russia and then returned to the United States before killing Mr. Kennedy. Mr. Nosenko told the C.I.A. that the K.G.B. was not behind the Kennedy assassination. In fact, he said that the K.G.B. had been so alarmed after the Kennedy assassination that it searched its own files and could not find any evidence that Mr. Oswald had ever worked for the K.G.B. But C.I.A. officials, led by the counterintelligence chief James Jesus Angleton, were convinced that Mr. Nosenko was a double agent sent by Moscow to muddy the waters. An earlier K.G.B. defector, Anatoliy Golitsyn, had convinced Mr. Angleton that every K.G.B. defector after him would be a double agent. As a result, Mr. Nosenko was held incommunicado for three years in a secret prison at the Farm, the C.I.A.s training center at Camp Peary, near Williamsburg, Va. After the C.I.A. finally realized Mr. Nosenko was telling the truth, he was released in 1967, given $80,000 by the C.I.A. and resettled under a new name.   It ends with damage assessments, political posturing and untold secrets.  Photo        James B. Comey, the F.B.I. director, and Adm. Michael S. Rogers, the director of the National Security Agency, testified before the House Intelligence Committee last week.   Credit Eric Thayer for The New York Times    Even after an arrest is made, counterintelligence officials can spend several more years trying to determine exactly how much damage was inflicted. Often that damage assessment takes on a political tinge, because officials want to either inflate the damage or play it down, depending on what an official or an agency or a department stands to win or lose. That will almost certainly be true with the Trump-Russia investigation. Frequently, the damage assessment reports remain classified, and the American public is never told how the story really ends.

Credit Doug Mills/The New York Times     WASHINGTON  The Republican chairman of the House Intelligence Committee rebuffed calls on Tuesday to recuse himself from the panels investigation into Russian meddling in the presidential election, as Democrats accused him of stalling the inquiry by canceling the committees meetings. Representative Devin Nunes of California, the chairman, said he would continue to lead the House investigation despite accusations from Democrats  including his committees ranking member, Representative Adam B. Schiff of California  that he is too close to President Trump to conduct an impartial inquiry. Why would I not? Mr. Nunes told reporters on Tuesday morning . Pressed about concerns from Democrats, he added, That sounds like their problem. The announcement that the committee would not hold a closed-door meeting on Tuesday as expected with James B. Comey, the F.B.I. director; and Adm. Michael S. Rogers, the director of the National Security Agency  a briefing Mr. Nunes insisted needed to happen before the committee could move forward with its public hearings  startled some Democrats. They added that the cancellations went further, including a regular meeting later in the week.

Continue reading the main story         Advertisement   Continue reading the main story       Effectively, what has happened is the committees oversight, the oversight of our national intelligence apparatus, has come to a halt because of this particular issue, he said. Mr. Nunes disputed that the investigation had stalled, though he noted that it was difficult for the committee to move forward with interviews and depositions until members could speak to Mr. Comey again. Nothing has been canceled, Mr. Nunes said. Everything is moving forward as is. He also said the committee had invited Mr. Comey to appear once more, though it was unclear when that might happen. A committee spokesman said the request had been extended to Admiral Rogers as well. Mr. Schiff did not sign the letter, two aides said. Speaker Paul D. Ryan maintained on Tuesday to reporters that he saw no reason for Mr. Nunes to step away from the investigation.

Mr. Ryan said on Tuesday that he did not know the source of that information. In a new flare-up on Tuesday, T he Washington Post reported that the White House had tried to block Sally Q. Yates, who was fired by Mr. Trump as acting attorney general in January, from appearing before the committee, apparently arguing that much of her testimony could be banned from discussion by presidential privilege that shields certain sensitive information from the public. In letters later obtained by The New York Times, her lawyer pushed back, asserting that much of what Ms. Yates would address had already been described publicly by senior administration officials. The letters were dated late last week, around the time Mr. Nunes abruptly announced his decision to scrap a public hearing.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   Sean Spicer, the White House press secretary, rejected the report as 100 percent false, saying the White House would not bar Ms. Yates from testifying. He also rejected the idea that the White House had pressured Mr. Nunes to cancel the hearing. I hope she testifies, he said. I look forward to it. Mr. Schiff said he was deeply concerned by the cancellation of the hearing with Ms. Yates and other former officials, which he said would have focused at least in part on Michael T. Flynn, the national security adviser who resigned after it was revealed that he lied to White House officials , including Vice President Mike Pence, about his contacts with Russia. It was the latest development in a week in which bipartisan cooperation quickly collapsed. Last week, without consulting Mr. Schiff, Mr. Nunes bumped a planned public hearing with James R. Clapper Jr., the former director of national intelligence; John O. Brennan, the former C.I.A. director; and Ms. Yates, who was fired after she instructed Justice Department officials to not carry out Mr. Trumps first proposed travel ban . Tensions had escalated on Monday after the confirmation that Mr. Nunes had traveled to the White House grounds last week to view what he described as classified intelligence documents. A day after that, he announced to the news media , and then to Mr. Trump, that he had seen information indicating that members of the Trump transition team may have been caught up in legal surveillance. None of us, Democrat or Republican on the Senate Intelligence Committee, still has any idea what hes talking about, said Senator Mark Warner of Virginia, the Democratic vice chairman of the committee. Mr. Schiff and Representative Nancy Pelosi of California, the top House Democrat, led calls for Mr. Nunes to recuse himself, arguing that he had proved himself incapable of leading an impartial investigation. Representative Walter B. Jones, a North Carolina Republican who has joined Democrats in calling for more scrutiny of Russian meddling in the election, also called on Tuesday for Mr. Nunes to step away from the investigation. Mr. Nunes was a member of the Trump transition team, as well as a vocal supporter of Mr. Trumps campaign.

Schiff, left, and Devin Nunes of the House Intelligence Committee spoke about their panels inquiry.   Credit Gabriella Demczuk for The New York Times     WASHINGTON  The assertion by the Republican chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, Representative Devin Nunes, that he saw intelligence reports showing that government surveillance programs incidentally collected communications involving Trump transition team members between November and January, has further muddied an already murky imbroglio. Mr. Nuness claim is part of a broader a tug of war over whether the public should focus on the F.B.I.s criminal investigation into possible Trump campaign coordination with Russia in its meddling in the 2016 election or, instead, on Obama-era surveillance that ensnared Trump team members and the propriety of leaks regarding what it uncovered. President Trump, under bipartisan fire for his apparently baseless insistence that President Barack Obama wiretapped his phones at Trump Tower in October , pronounced himself somewhat vindicated by Mr. Nuness assertion. And Fox Newss Sean Hannity, a staunch Trump supporter, broadcast a segment with Mr. Nunes labeled Trump Surveillance Confirmed. The developments have heightened the importance of understanding several things about surveillance practices and terms.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   What is incidental collection? Sometimes American surveillance programs, while targeting foreigners or foreign agents for intelligence purposes, end up intercepting private information about Americans too.  Continue reading the main story         Advertisement   Continue reading the main story       Imagine, for example, that the American government is wiretapping Ivan the Russian. Usually, Ivan just talks to other Russians. But one day, he talks on the phone or exchanges emails with Joe the American. The government intercepts Joes words as an incidental byproduct of its targeting of Ivan; the government is not monitoring Joes conversations with anyone else. Complicating matters, incidental collection can also be information about an American the government gathers by intercepting a conversation between two foreigners who discuss the American, even though he is not a participant. Is it surprising that the government incidentally collected information about Trump transition team members? Not really. Federal Bureau of Investigation counterintelligence agents routinely try to monitor foreign diplomats from adversary nations, like the Russian ambassador, Sergey I. Kislyak . The Times has reported that this is how the government came to intercept a conversation between Michael T. Flynn, then-President-elect Trumps top national security adviser, and Mr. Kislyak in December about sanctions against Russia. Mr. Nunes said the intelligence reports he saw involving incidentally collected information about Trump transition team members were unrelated to Russia. But because of his global business dealings and because he was the president-elect, Mr. Trump and his team were very likely talking to, and being talked about by, many prominent foreigners around the world whose communications the National Security Agency might target for intelligence-gathering purposes. What are the rules for using incidentally collected information about Americans? The government puts raw, or not yet processed, emails and phone calls it intercepts into repositories that intelligence analysts then query in search of messages relevant to what they are working on. They can search the repositories using keywords or the names of people related to their investigation, including the names of Americans. When writing surveillance-based reports for broader dissemination within the intelligence community, analysts are supposed to minimize any privacy intrusion into Americans. Generally, this requires them to mask any names and private information about Americans. For example, a report citing Ivans phone call with Joe might recount what Ivan said to U.S. Person 1, rather than using Joes name and remarks.

See Sample  Manage Email Preferences  Not you?  Privacy Policy  Opt out or contact us anytime      When might an Americans name be unmasked in a report? Minimization rules make an exception to the masking requirement if the Americans words and identity are necessary to understand foreign intelligence. This exception would seem to cover keeping Mr. Flynns identity and words unmasked in disseminated materials about his conversation with Mr. Kislyak. Much remains murky about the separate concerns Mr. Nunes expressed this week about intelligence reports that were unrelated to Russia and contained incidentally collected information about members of the Trump transition team. Mr. Nunes has suggested that he has concerns about unmasked names in them. But the top Democrat on the Intelligence Committee, Representative Adam B. Schiff, has said Mr. Nunes had clarified that they were masked in the reports and the problem was Mr. Nunes could still tell who they were.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   Is incidental surveillance a new concern? No. Long before the present controversies, the governments handling of Americans private communications that its surveillance programs collect incidentally has been the subject of a major public policy dispute. Its called the backdoor search loophole when officials search raw repositories of surveillance information intending to pull out and read any incidentally collected private messages of an American  especially when those messages were gathered without a warrant in the first place. Notably, while most agencies may only perform such a search for intelligence purposes, the F.B.I. may sometimes do so for ordinary criminal investigations too. There are two types of warrantless surveillance that incidentally gather Americans private communications. Under the FISA Amendments Act, the government, while operating on domestic soil, may target specific foreigners abroad without a warrant. Under Executive Order 12333 , the government, while operating abroad, may vacuum up communications in bulk, without targeting anyone. The FISA Amendments Act will expire at the end of 2017 unless Congress enacts new legislation extending it. Privacy advocates are hoping to force the government to say how often it intercepts an Americans message incidentally through that program, and to require the government to start getting warrants before using an Americans name to query the repository. To date, there has been less discussion of imposing a similar requirement for so-called 12333 surveillance. Who else gets to see this raw surveillance? In January, the Obama administration completed bureaucratic work on a change that had been set in motion by President George W. Bush more than eight years earlier. It permitted the N.S.A. to share access to certain streams of raw 12333 surveillance with the other 16 intelligence agencies. This permits the other agencies to search through that repository directly and apply minimization maskings themselves, rather than relying on N.S.A. analysts to spot anything relevant and disseminate it to them in intelligence reports. What does that have to do with all this? Some of Mr. Trumps supporters, like Mr. Hannity, have pushed a theory that Mr. Obamas move  which expanded the number of officials with access to raw 12333 intercepts  may be connected to leaks like the disclosure of Mr. Flynns call with the Russian ambassador. One problem with this theory is that the call was apparently intercepted under FISA, not 12333, since it was between an American and another person on domestic soil. Several intelligence agencies, including the F.B.I., the N.S.A. and the C.I.A., were already permitted to share raw FISA information .   Follow Charlie Savage on Twitter @charlie_savage .
