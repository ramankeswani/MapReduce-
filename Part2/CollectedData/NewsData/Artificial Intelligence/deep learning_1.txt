Mend started very organically after I went through a breakup, she said.   Credit Scott Leon for The New York Times     Have you ever broken up with someone  or had someone break up with you? Was it traumatic, regardless of who decided to end the relationship? How did you get over it? If you had known there was a heartbreak app to help, would you have used it? In  A Personal Trainer for Heartbreak , Sophia Kercher writes: After a traumatic breakup, Julia Scinto, a fashion designer in Manhattan, found herself searching online sites far and wide, looking for any available resource to help her feel better.  I even considered hypnosis, said Ms. Scinto, who designs womens wear for Macys private label.  Instead, she discovered Mend, an app and online community that serves as part personal trainer, part online refuge for the brokenhearted.  On the Mend app , users are introduced to an animated avatar of the Mend founder, Ellen Huerta, and her reassuring voice offers guidance on how to move forward, with topics like detoxing from your ex; redefining your sense of self  even how to get a better nights sleep.  Its this charming and endearing voice of a friend, Ms. Scinto said. And theres a line, We never get tired of hearing about your breakup, and those words are like an oasis in the desert. Students: Read the entire article, then tell us:  Do you think the Mend app offers people something different in its approach to healing after a breakup? If so, what makes it different? If not, why not? Would you want to use it the next time youre in that situation?    What advice would you give a friend who is going through a terrible time because of the end of a relationship?  What do you think is the best way to heal a broken heart? Students 13 and older are invited to comment.

Do you remember any on-air non-apologies by politicians, celebrities, or sports figures? Or, conversely, can you think of any public apologies that were memorable, sincere and heartfelt? What apologies stand out to you as especially beautiful and true, or especially fake? In  The Right Way to Say 'I'm Sorry' , Jane E. Brody writes: Most people say Im sorry many times a day for a host of trivial affronts  accidentally bumping into someone or failing to hold open a door. These apologies are easy and usually readily accepted, often with a response like, No problem.  But when Im sorry are the words needed to right truly hurtful words, acts or inaction, they can be the hardest ones to utter. And even when an apology is offered with the best of intentions, it can be seriously undermined by the way in which it is worded. Instead of eradicating the emotional pain the affront caused, a poorly worded apology can result in lasting anger and antagonism, and undermine an important relationship. She continues: The focus of an apology should be on what the offender has said or done, not on the persons reaction to it. Saying Im sorry you feel that way shifts the focus away from the person who is supposedly apologizing and turns Im sorry into Im not really sorry at all, the psychologist wrote. Students: Read the entire article, then tell us:  Have you ever received, or given, an apology like the ideal one described in the article? What happened, and how did you feel afterward?  In your opinion, what personal qualities are needed for a person to deliver a true apology? Do you have anything to add to the articles suggestions for a true apology?    Can a true apology mend relationships, soothe wounds and heal broken hearts? If so, how? If not, why not? Students 13 and older are invited to comment.

Credit Peter van Agtmael/Magnum, for The New York Times     Can you think of any stories where one persons efforts influenced, inspired or improved the lives of others? Describe examples in which a single person created positive change on a small or a grand scale, in history or today, globally or in a small corner of your own world. In  The Youth Group That Launched a Movement at Standing Rock , Saul Elbein writes: Jasilyn Charger was 19 when she learned her best friend had killed herself. Charger was Lakota Sioux, and she had left the Cheyenne River Reservation in South Dakota for Portland, Ore., just a few months earlier. But in the summer of 2015, she flew home for her friends funeral. Then, two days later, while she was still in Eagle Butte  the largest town on the Cheyenne River Reservation with a population of 1,300  another friend killed herself. Charger was shocked. It hurt all of us because these were people who we thought we knew but really we had no idea what they were going through, she said. It really woke us up.  In the weeks that followed, more teenagers on the reservation killed themselves with belts, knives and handfuls of Benadryl. Native American teenagers and young adults are 1.5 times as likely to kill themselves as the national average, with suicides often clustering in epidemics that hit and fade. Suicide is so common on the reservation that Lakota youth dont bother to say committed suicide or attempted suicide. They just say attempted or completed. By the end of that summer, Jasilyn told me, 30 Cheyenne River kids attempted and eight completed. The article continues: Together with White Eyes and their friend, Trenton Casillas-Bakeberg, [Charger] formed a youth group. They raised money for basketball tournaments and for a youth trip to the Red Nation Film Festival in California, where the kids were able to see the ocean for the first time in their landlocked lives. They went to the tribal council, demanding and getting funds for a safe house for young people. Most of all they counseled young people, urging them to look out for one another and get involved. Yeah, it looks all pretty on Facebook, Charger remembered saying, but really, whats going on in real life? You can be busy getting on Snapchat while someones getting bullied.  As the suicide wave crested and broke, the youth group, now called the One Mind Youth Movement, turned to something more political. They spent that fall as part of the local campaign against the Keystone XL pipeline, whose route would cut under the Cheyenne River just upstream from the reservation that bears its name. And after the Obama State Department denied the Keystone XL permission to cross the U.S.-Canadian border in November 2015, they moved their focus to the neighboring Standing Rock Sioux Reservation, where the company Energy Transfer Partners was trying to build the Dakota Access Pipeline. That pipeline would move half a million barrels of oil a day beneath the Missouri River, the main source of drinking water for the Standing Rock Sioux, which is one of the cousin bands to Cheyenne River, as well as for other downstream Sioux reservations. The youths came to believe that the Dakota pipeline was not only a threat to their drinking water but also a harbinger of the larger environmental crisis their generation was set to inherit. Students: Read the entire article, then tell us:  What went through your mind as you read the story? Were you inspired by one teenagers effort to help reduce suicides among young people in her community? Were you surprised by the way her desire to help snowballed into a movement, and made a real difference? Why or why not?  Is there any problem or cause you would like to do something about? What is it, and what do you think would help?    What are some of the many ways teenagers  even just one teenager  can make a difference in the world? Students 13 and older are invited to comment.

The fish has a head joint that allows its mouth to open 120 degrees and swallow large prey whole.   Credit Nalani Schnell/Museum National DHistoire Naturelle     Were about 600 to 3,000 feet below the oceans surface. Its cold, its dark and its slow down here. If youre lucky, its blue in the daytime and black at night. And the deeper we go, the darker it gets. Welcome to the twilight zone , fishies. Theres not much to eat and no green plants growing either. Here, you eat what you can get, and find a way to eat it, or you starve. Its weird down here, in the mesopelagic zone of the deep sea. Creatures can be sluggish, but they are well adapted. Some use big eyes to find prey. Others make their own flashlights. Big mouths help predators eat big prey. That may be why barbeled dragonfishes have special head joints that allow them to open up their mouths 120 degrees and swallow big prey whole. This flexible head joint, described for the first time in a study published on Wednesday in the journal PLOS One, is unlike any other known to science. Nalani Schnell , a zoologist at the French National Museum of Natural History , had already discovered that different groups of barbeled dragonfishes had an unusual gap between their heads and necks that other fishes dont have. Some gaps were the result of a missing first vertebrae. Others resulted from the absence of a spine, filled in instead with an elongated notochord, a flexible rod made up of something similar to cartilage.          A manipulation of the jaws of the barbeled dragonfish, which is cleared and double stained.  Nalani Schnell, Museum National d'Histoire Naturelle        To find out the function of these gaps, Dr. Schnell teamed up with Dave Johnson , a zoologist at the Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History . Together, they obtained five divergent groups of the species from museum collections, macerated the flesh from their bodies and stained the bones different colors. This allowed them to actually move the bones around, which led to the discovery that the gap was a functional joint that allows the fishs head to move up and out.

But the barbeled dragonfishes are sit-and-wait (ambush) predators, and prey items are scarce in the deep-sea.  Continue reading the main story         Advertisement   Continue reading the main story       As the species diverged into different groups, the flexible gaps in the more primitive fish developed into an actual folding apparatus that makes this a true joint, Dr. Johnson said. There are no other fishes that have that sort of a directional, complex articulation. A joint that allows them to open their mouths wide is advantageous because they can engulf large prey that can sustain them for long periods of no food. Like the moray eel , barbeled dragonfishes use a second set of teeth to pull the large prey into their bodies to digest it. Imagine yourself out in the middle of the ocean, and youre trying to make a living. Youre going to eat anything you can, if you think it isnt going to kill you, Dr. Johnson said. You dont bypass this thing because its too big to eat, because you dont know when youre going to see another meal.
