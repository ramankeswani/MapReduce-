The secretive ride-hailing giant Uber rarely discusses internal matters in public. But in March, facing crises on multiple fronts, top officials convened a call for reporters to insist that Uber was changing its culture and would no longer tolerate brilliant jerks.    Notably, the company also announced that it would fix its troubled relationship with drivers, who have complained for years about falling pay and arbitrary treatment.    Weve underinvested in the driver experience, a senior official said. We are now re-examining everything we do in order to rebuild that love.    And yet even as Uber talks up its determination to treat drivers more humanely, it is engaged in an extraordinary behind-the-scenes experiment in behavioral science to manipulate them in the service of its corporate growth  an effort whose dimensions became evident in interviews with several dozen current and former Uber officials, drivers and social scientists, as well as a review of behavioral research.    Ubers innovations reflect the changing ways companies are managing workers amid the rise of the freelance-based gig economy. Its drivers are officially independent business owners rather than traditional employees with set schedules. This allows Uber to minimize labor costs, but means it cannot compel drivers to show up at a specific place and time. And this lack of control can wreak havoc on a service whose goal is to seamlessly transport passengers whenever and wherever they want.    Uber helps solve this fundamental problem by using psychological inducements and other techniques unearthed by social science to influence when, where and how long drivers work. Its a quest for a perfectly efficient system: a balance between rider demand and driver supply at the lowest cost to passengers and the company.    Employing hundreds of social scientists and data scientists, Uber has experimented with video game techniques, graphics and noncash rewards of little value that can prod drivers into working longer and harder  and sometimes at hours and locations that are less lucrative for them.    Faster pickup times mean more idle drivers.  Change the number of drivers in this ride-share simulation. Faster pickup times for riders require a greater percentage of drivers to be idling unpaid.           To keep drivers on the road, the company has exploited some peoples tendency to set earnings goals  alerting them that they are ever so close to hitting a precious target when they try to log off. It has even concocted an algorithm similar to a Netflix feature that automatically loads the next program, which many experts believe encourages binge-watching. In Ubers case, this means sending drivers their next fare opportunity before their current ride is even over.    And most of this happens without giving off a whiff of coercion.    We show drivers areas of high demand or incentivize them to drive more, said Michael Amodeo, an Uber spokesman. But any driver can stop work literally at the tap of a button  the decision whether or not to drive is 100 percent theirs.    Ubers recent emphasis on drivers is no accident. As problems have mounted at the company, from an allegation of sexual harassment in its offices to revelations that it created a tool to deliberately evade regulatory scrutiny , Uber has made softening its posture toward drivers a litmus test of its ability to become a better corporate citizen. The tension was particularly evident after its chief executive, Travis Kalanick, engaged in a heated argument with a driver that was captured in a viral video obtained by Bloomberg and that prompted an abject apology.    But an examination by The New York Times found that Uber is continuing apace in its struggle to wield the upper hand with drivers. And as so-called platform-mediated work like driving for Uber increasingly becomes the way people make a living, the companys example illustrates that pulling psychological levers may eventually become the reigning approach to managing the American worker.    While Uber is arguably the biggest and most sophisticated player in inducing workers to serve its corporate goals, other gig economy platforms are also involved. Ubers main competitor, Lyft, and popular delivery services like Postmates rely on similar approaches . So do companies and individuals posting assignments on crowdsourcing sites like Amazon Mechanical Turk, where hundreds of thousands of workers earn piece-rate wages by completing discrete tasks.    Of course, many companies try to nudge consumers into buying their products and services using psychological tricks. But extending these efforts to the work force is potentially transformative.    Though employers have long borrowed insights from social science to get more out of their workers  tech companies like Google have calculated that employees interact more with unfamiliar colleagues when they can graze together at snack bars  they are constrained in doing so. A large body of law and custom in the United States holds that because employers have far more power over their employees than businesses do over their customers, they must provide them with far greater protections  not least, a minimum wage and overtime pay.    Uber exists in a kind of legal and ethical purgatory, however. Because its drivers are independent contractors, they lack most of the protections associated with employment. By mastering their workers mental circuitry, Uber and the like may be taking the economy back toward a pre-New Deal era when businesses had enormous power over workers and few checks on their ability to exploit it.    Were talking about this kind of manipulation that literally affects peoples income, said Ryan Calo, a law professor at the University of Washington who with Alex Rosenblat has written a paper on the way companies use data and algorithms to exploit psychological weaknesses. Uber officials, he said, are using what they know about drivers, their control over the interface and the terms of transaction to channel the behavior of the driver in the direction they want it to go.    An Empathy Question    In early 2016, a group of roughly 100 Uber employees responsible for signing up drivers and getting them to drive more voted to change its name  from supply growth to driver growth.     The vote was not unprompted. For much of the previous year, Uber executives had agonized over how to lower the rate at which drivers were deserting the platform.    Alongside Ubers already daunting targets for expanding its pool of drivers to meet mounting demand, the high turnover threatened to cap the companys growth and throw it into crisis.    Uber conducted interviews and focus groups while executives peppered employees with questions like, What are we doing to have more empathy for the driver side of the equation?    Underlying the tension was the fact that Ubers interests and those of drivers are at odds on some level. Drivers, who typically keep whats left of their gross fare after Uber takes a roughly 25 percent commission, prefer some scarcity in their ranks to keep them busier and push up earnings. For its part, Uber is desperate to avoid shortages, seeking instead to serve every customer quickly, ideally in five minutes or less.    This is particularly true of shortages so pronounced as to create a surge  that is, a higher fare than normal. While surges do mitigate shortages, they do so in part by repelling passengers, something directly at odds with Ubers long-term goal of dominating the industry. For us, its better not to surge, said Daniel Graf, Ubers vice president of product. If we dont surge, we can produce more rides.    As a result, much of Ubers communication with drivers over the years has aimed at combating shortages by advising drivers to move to areas where they exist, or where they might arise. Uber encouraged its local managers to experiment with ways of achieving this.           A screengrab of a prompt that Eli Solomon, an Uber driver in the Chicago area, received on his app.         It was all day long, every day  texts, emails, pop-ups: Hey, the morning rush has started. Get to this area, thats where demand is biggest, said Ed Frantzen, a veteran Uber driver in the Chicago area. It was always, constantly, trying to get you into a certain direction.    Some local managers who were men went so far as to adopt a female persona for texting drivers, having found that the uptake was higher when they did.    Laura would tell drivers: Hey, the concerts about to let out. You should head over there, said John P. Parker, a manager in Ubers Dallas office in 2014 and 2015, referring to one of the personas. We have an overwhelmingly male driver population.    Uber acknowledged that it had experimented with female personas to increase engagement with drivers.    The friction over meeting demand was compounded by complaints about arrangements like aggressive car leases that required many drivers to work upward of 50 or 60 hours each week to eke out a profit. Uber officials began to worry that a driver backlash was putting them at a strategic disadvantage in their competition with Lyft, which had cultivated a reputation for being more driver-friendly.    Uber had long been a reflection of Mr. Kalanick, its charismatic and hard-charging chief, who has often involved himself in corporate minutiae. According to an article in The Information , Mr. Kalanick had complained to subordinates that he was not informed sooner about a glitch with the companys push notifications and had personally weighed in on the time at which employees could receive free dinner.           Travis Kalanick, the chief executive of Uber, recently apologized for getting in a heated argument with a driver over fare reductions.  Julie Glassberg for The New York Times        Now Uber began a process of, in effect, becoming a little less like Mr. Kalanick, and a little more like Lyft.    It rethought a lease program, softened the hectoring tone of its messages and limited their volume. At times it became positively cheery.    During roughly the same period, Uber was increasingly concerned that many new drivers were leaving the platform before completing the 25 rides that would earn them a signing bonus. To stem that tide, Uber officials in some cities began experimenting with simple encouragement: Youre almost halfway there, congratulations!    While the experiment seemed warm and innocuous, it had in fact been exquisitely calibrated. The companys data scientists had previously discovered that once drivers reached the 25-ride threshold, their rate of attrition fell sharply.    And psychologists and video game designers have long known that encouragement toward a concrete goal can motivate people to complete a task.    Its getting you to internalize the companys goals, said Chelsea Howe, a prominent video game designer who has spoken out against coercive psychological techniques deployed in games. Internalized motivation is the most powerful kind.     Mr. Amodeo, the Uber spokesman, defended the practice. We try to make the early experience as good as possible, but also as realistic as possible, he said. We want people to decide for themselves if driving is right for them.    That making drivers feel good could be compatible with treating them as lab subjects was no surprise. None other than Lyft itself had shown as much several years earlier.    In 2013, the company hired a consulting firm to figure out how to encourage more driving during the platforms busiest hours.    At the time, Lyft drivers could voluntarily sign up in advance for shifts. The consultants devised an experiment in which the company showed one group of inexperienced drivers how much more they would make by moving from a slow period like Tuesday morning to a busy time like Friday night  about $15 more per hour.    For another group, Lyft reversed the calculation, displaying how much drivers were losing by sticking with Tuesdays.    The latter had a more significant effect on increasing the hours drivers scheduled during busy periods.    Kristen Berman, one of the consultants, explained at a presentation in 2014 that the experiment had roots in the field of behavioral economics, which studies the cognitive hang-ups that frequently skew decision-making. Its central finding derived from a concept known as loss aversion, which holds that people dislike losing more than they like gaining, Ms. Berman said.    What motivates you more: seeing gains or fearing losses?           Still, Ms. Berman disclosed in an interview, Lyft eventually decided against using the loss-aversion approach, suggesting that the company has drawn brighter lines when it comes to potential manipulation.    Almost There    As he tried to log off at 7:13 a.m. on New Years Day last year, Josh Streeter, then an Uber driver in the Tampa, Fla., area, received a message on the companys driver app with the headline Make it to $330. The text then explained: Youre $10 away from making $330 in net earnings. Are you sure you want to go offline? Below were two prompts: Go offline and Keep driving. The latter was already highlighted.    Ive got screen shots with dozens of these messages, said Mr. Streeter, who began driving full time for Lyft and then Uber in 2014 but quit last year to invest in real estate.           Josh Streeter, a former Uber driver in the Tampa, Fla., area, said he often received messages from the company encouraging him to stay on the road to earn more money.  Edward Linsmier for The New York Times        Mr. Streeter was not alone. For months, when drivers tried to log out, the app would frequently tell them they were only a certain amount away from making a seemingly arbitrary sum for the day, or from matching their earnings from that point one week earlier.    The messages were intended to exploit another relatively widespread behavioral tic  peoples preoccupation with goals  to nudge them into driving longer.    Over the past 20 years, behavioral economists have found evidence for a phenomenon known as income targeting, in which workers who can decide how long to work each day, like cabdrivers, do so with a goal in mind  say, $100  much the way marathon runners try to get their time below four hours or three hours.    While there is debate among economists as to how widespread the practice is and how strictly cabdrivers follow such targets, top officials at Uber and Lyft have certainly concluded that many of their drivers set income goals. Others are motivated by an income target for sure, said Brian Hsu, the Lyft vice president in charge of supply. You hear stories about people who want to buy that next thing. He added, Weve started to allow drivers to set up those goals as well in the app.    Uber even published a study last year, using its vast pile of data on drivers rides and hours, finding that a substantial, although not most, fraction of partners practice an extreme form of income targeting when they start on the platform, though they abandon it as they gain more experience. Strict income targeting is highly inefficient because it leads drivers to work long hours on days when business is slow and their hourly take is low, and to knock off early on days when business is brisk.    Ride-share companies can benefit if they get drivers to focus on dollar targets, instead of working only during the busiest times.  Tip: Watch the hourly wage rates.           The beauty of the messages that Uber sent Mr. Streeter and his fellow drivers is that the drivers need not have even had a specific income goal in mind in order for the messages to work. Some of the most addictive games ever made, like the 1980s and 90s hit Tetris, rely on a feeling of progress toward a goal that is always just beyond the players grasp. As the psychologist Adam Alter writes in his book Irresistible, this mental state has a name: the ludic loop. (The term was coined by the anthropologist and slot machine expert Natasha Schull.)    Uber, for its part, appears to be aware of the ludic loop. In its messages to drivers, it included a graphic of an engine gauge with a needle that came tantalizingly close to, but was still short of, a dollar sign.    And the ludic loop is far from the only video game feature that Uber has adapted as a way of keeping drivers on the road.     At any moment, the app shows drivers how many trips they have taken in the current week, how much money they have made, how much time they have spent logged on and what their overall rating from passengers is. All of these metrics can stimulate the competitive juices that drive compulsive game-playing.           One of the messages Uber has sent its drivers to encourage them to stay on the road.         The whole thing is like a video game, said Eli Solomon, a veteran Uber and Lyft driver in the Chicago area, who said he sometimes had to fight the urge to work more after glancing at his data.    Sometimes the so-called gamification is quite literal. Like players on video game platforms such as Xbox, PlayStation and Pogo, Uber drivers can earn badges for achievements like Above and Beyond (denoted on the app by a cartoon of a rocket blasting off), Excellent Service (marked by a picture of a sparkling diamond) and Entertaining Drive (a pair of Groucho Marx glasses with nose and eyebrows).    Of course, managers have been borrowing from the logic of games for generations, as when they set up contests and competition among workers. More overt forms of gamification have proliferated during the past decade. For example, Microsoft has used the approach to entice workers to perform the otherwise sleep-inducing task of software debugging.    But Uber can go much further. Because it mediates its drivers entire work experience through an app, there are few limits to the elements it can gamify. Uber collects staggering amounts of data that allow it to discard game features that do not work and refine those that do. And because its workers are contractors, the gamification strategies are not hemmed in by employment law.    Kevin Werbach, a business professor who has written extensively on the subject, said that while gamification could be a force for good in the gig economy  for example, by creating bonds among workers who do not share a physical space  there was a danger of abuse. If what youre doing is basically saying, Weve found a cheap way to get you to do work without paying you for it, well pay you in badges that dont cost anything, thats a manipulative way to go about it, he said.    For some drivers, that is precisely the effect. Scott Weber said he drove full time most weeks last year, picking up passengers in the Tampa area for both Uber and Lyft, yet made less than $20,000 before expenses like gas and maintenance. I was a business that had a loss, said Mr. Weber, who is looking for another job. Im using payday loans.    Still, when asked about the badges he earns while driving for Uber, Mr. Weber practically gushed. Ive got currently 12 excellent-service and nine great-conversation badges, he said in an interview in early March. It tells me where Im at.           Scott Weber, a driver for both Uber and Lyft in the Tampa area, said he drove full time most weeks last year but struggled to turn a profit.  Edward Linsmier for The New York Times        Constantly Busy    When asked whether Ubers product managers and data scientists were akin to developers at a social gaming company like Zynga, Jonathan Hall, Ubers head of economic and policy research, accepted the analogy but rejected the implication.    I think theres something to that, but ultimately Zynga should worry mostly about how fun its games are rather than trying to get you to play a little bit more by some trick, he said. He argued that exploiting peoples psychological tics was unlikely to have more than a marginal effect on how long they played Zyngas games or drove for Uber. It is icing on the cake, he said.    Mr. Hall is clearly right about the effects of certain techniques, like those pitched at drivers tendency to set income targets or to focus more on losses than gains. On the other hand, even features that produce relatively small changes in driving patterns can become quite important to a company like Uber.    According to Mr. Parker, the former Uber manager in Dallas, increasing the number of drivers on the road by 20 percent at certain hours of the day, or in a busy part of town, can rein in a large fare surge.    More important, some of the psychological levers that Uber pulls to increase the supply of drivers have quite powerful effects.           Ed Frantzen, a veteran Uber driver in the Chicago area, said of the company and its messages to drivers, It was always, constantly, trying to get you into a certain direction.  Brittany Sowacke for The New York Times        Consider an algorithm called forward dispatch  Lyft has a similar one  that dispatches a new ride to a driver before the current one ends. Forward dispatch shortens waiting times for passengers, who may no longer have to wait for a driver 10 minutes away when a second driver is dropping off a passenger two minutes away.    Perhaps no less important, forward dispatch causes drivers to stay on the road substantially longer during busy periods  a key goal for both companies.    Uber and Lyft explain this in essentially the same way. Drivers keep telling us the worst thing is when theyre idle for a long time, said Kevin Fan, the director of product at Lyft. If its slow, theyre going to go sign off. We want to make sure theyre constantly busy.     While this is unquestionably true, there is another way to think of the logic of forward dispatch: It overrides self-control.    Perhaps the most prominent example is that such automatic queuing appears to have fostered the rise of binge-watching on Netflix. When one program is nearing the end of its running time, Netflix will automatically cue up the next episode in that series for you, wrote the scholars Matthew Pittman and Kim Sheehan in a 2015 study of the phenomenon. It requires very little effort to binge on Netflix; in fact, it takes more effort to stop than to keep going.    As with viewers and binge-watching, many drivers appear to enjoy the forward-dispatch feature, which can increase earnings by keeping them busier. But it can also work against their interests by increasing the number of drivers on the road and defusing fare surges. And whether they enjoy it is separate from the question of agency  whether they have it, or whether the company does.    Uber officials say the feature initially produced so many rides at times that drivers began to experience a chronic Netflix ailment  the inability to stop for a bathroom break. Amid the uproar, Uber introduced a pause button.    Drivers were saying: I can never go offline. Im on just continuous trips. This is a problem. So we redesigned it, said Maya Choksi, a senior Uber official in charge of building products that help drivers. In the middle of the trip, you can say, Stop giving me requests. So you can have more control over when you want to stop driving.    It is true that drivers can pause the services automatic queuing feature if they need to refill their tanks, or empty them, as the case may be. Yet once they log back in and accept their next ride, the feature kicks in again. To disable it, they would have to pause it every time they picked up a new passenger. By contrast, even Netflix allows users to permanently turn off its automatic queuing feature, known as Post-Play.    This pre-emptive hard-wiring can have a huge influence on behavior, said David Laibson, the chairman of the economics department at Harvard and a leading behavioral economist. Perhaps most notably, as Ms. Rosenblat and Luke Stark observed in an influential paper on these practices, Ubers app does not let drivers see where a passenger is going before accepting the ride, making it hard to judge how profitable a trip will be.    Sometimes all that is necessary is the mere setting of a so-called default. Because humans tend to be governed by inertia, automatically enrolling them in retirement savings plans and then allowing them to opt out results in far higher participation than letting them opt in. Making Post-Play the default can have the same effect.    If done right, these things can be socially beneficial, Mr. Laibson said. But you can think of all sorts of choice architecture that are quite contrary to human well-being.    Even Mr. Hall, the Uber research director who downplayed the importance of behavioral economics to the company, did make at least one concession. The optimal default we set is that we want you to do as much work as there is to do, he said of the companys app. Youre not required to by any means. But thats the default.    Having more drivers on the road benefits ride-share companies, but drivers profit from surge pricing and scarcity in their ranks.  Ride-share companies, which do not bear the direct costs of drivers being idle, want to have as many drivers available as possible.         Simulation details: There are 20 drivers. During surge, prices increase by 2 x and passenger requests are reduced by 30% . Passengers cancel after 10 minutes of waiting without a driver accepting their request. Regular fares cost $1 a minute, driver expenses are $0.10 a minute, and the app company takes a $1.50 booking fee plus 20% of the per-minute fees.    Imagining the Future    There are aspects of the platforms that genuinely do increase drivers control over their work lives, as Uber frequently points out. Unlike most workers, an Uber driver can put in a few hours each day between dropping children off at school and picking them up in the afternoon.    Uber is even in the process of developing a feature that allows drivers to tell the app in advance that they need to arrive at a given location at a given time. If you need to pick up your kids at soccer practice at 6 p.m., said Nundu Janakiram, the Uber official in charge of products that improve drivers experiences, it will start to give you trips to take you in the general direction to get to a specific place in time.    There is also the possibility that as the online gig economy matures, companies like Uber may adopt a set of norms that limit their ability to manipulate workers through cleverly designed apps.    Kelly Peters, chief executive of BEworks, a management consulting firm specializing in behavioral science, argued that the same data that makes it easier for Uber to nudge drivers into working an additional 30 or 60 minutes also makes it hard to escape the obligation to look after them.    For example, the company has access to a variety of metrics, like braking and acceleration speed, that indicate whether someone is driving erratically and may need to rest. The next step may be individualized targeting and nudging in the moment, Ms. Peters said. Hey, you just got three passengers in a row who said they felt unsafe. Go home. Uber has already rolled out efforts in this vein in numerous cities.    That moment of maturity does not appear to have arrived yet, however. Consider a prompt that Uber rolled out this year, inviting drivers to press a large box if they want the app to navigate them to an area where they have a higher chance of finding passengers. The accompanying graphic resembles the one that indicates that an areas fares are surging, except in this case fares are not necessarily higher.    Some drivers believe that the intent is to trick them into driving where Uber wants them to go, rather than where driving would be most profitable, by implying that they will find a surge there. Theyre trying to move people where they want them, said Mr. Weber, the Tampa-area driver. But you get there and its nothing. It happens all the time. Mr. Weber noted that the design of the graphic makes the prompt much easier to accept than decline, which requires pressing a small rectangle in the top left corner.    Uber said that the feature was an experiment intended primarily to help new drivers who frequently say they do not know where to find passengers, and that it could be changed if drivers were dissatisfied.    Individual features aside, the broader question of how much Uber seeks to influence drivers through behavioral science may come down to how much its business model requires it.     While the company has made no secret of its investment in self-driving cars, it could be a decade or more before they completely replace human drivers. In the meantime, as long as Uber continues to set growth and passenger volume as critical goals, it will have an incentive to make wringing more hours out of drivers a higher priority than the drivers bottom line whenever it faces a close call between the two.    It will also have an incentive to obtain these hours as cheaply as possible. And there is simply no cheaper way than hiring contractors and nudging them to drive when and where they are needed. Industry insiders estimate that relying on independent contractors rather than employees can lower direct costs by roughly 25 percent.    Moreover, the contractor model itself provides a strong impetus for companies like Uber to grow. Many companies in the gig economy simply do not have enough workers, or rich enough data about their workers behavior, to navigate busy periods using nudges and the like. To avoid chronic understaffing, they have switched to an employee model that allows them to compel workers to log in when the companies most need them.    Once companies achieve a certain scale, on the other hand, they enter a virtuous cycle: The risk of understaffing drops with a big enough pool of workers, and the cost savings of using contractors begins to outweigh the inefficiencies. This in turn frees up money to enter new markets and acquire new customers, which makes the contractor model still more efficient, and throws off still more savings.    It is, as a result, not too hard to imagine a future in which massive digital platforms like Uber have an appetite for tens of millions of workers  not only for ferrying people, but also for delivering food and retail goods. Nor is it hard to imagine workers obliging them, perhaps because their skills do not match the needs of more traditional employers, or because they need to supplement their wages.    In such an economy, experts say, using big data and algorithms to manage workers will not simply be a niche phenomenon. It may become one of the most common ways of managing the American labor force.    You have all these players entering into this space, and the assumption is theyll do it through vast armies of underemployed people looking for extra hours, and we can control every nuance about what they do but not have to pay them, said David Weil, the top wage-and-hour official under President Barack Obama.    When you stop to consider the enormous cost advantages, Mr. Weil said, it says to me this is an area that will grow fast.

One big advantage a car GPS unit has over phone apps: It doesnt need a data connection to plot a route.   Credit Roger Kisby for The New York Times     The smartphone has replaced so many other devices and tools  cameras, notebooks, tape recorders  that I thought the answer was obvious when I asked Rik Paul, the autos editor at The Wirecutter, a product reviews website owned by The New York Times, if buying a GPS unit for the car made sense anymore . Boy, was I wrong. I rely on a cellphone with Google Maps to find my way around. Why would I ever want to buy a GPS unit? The major maps apps are excellent, with awesome traffic information. If Im going for a short jaunt around town, Ill always grab my phone. But for longer trips, especially, dedicated car-GPS devices have some advantages. Like what? One big advantage is that GPS devices dont rely on a data connection to plot a route. They have the map data stored inside. Ive used my phone to navigate to a rural area  say, upstate Vermont  and since the app cached the original route, it got me there just fine.

In our car GPS guide , we picked the Garmin Drive 51 LMT-S as the best for most people, which costs about $170. There are less expensive ones, about $100. So, yeah, its an investment. Still, having a GPS frees your phone for other uses, such as music or calls. And the latest GPS units are now multitasking in ways that a phones navigation app cant.

Credit Roger Kisby for The New York Times    For example, Garmins entire Drive lineup can connect to a backup camera. And there are higher-end combo models that integrate a dash cam. Traditionally, a dash cam is primarily for keeping a record in case of an accident, but some of these new GPS models can also provide some pretty advanced safety features, such as forward-collision warnings, lane-departure alerts, and even the ability to automatically send a text if theres a crash. Those are features weve come to expect from new cars, but up until now were difficult to find as aftermarket add-ons for older or more basic cars. These camera-based units dont work as well as an expensive built-in system with multiple sensors, but theyre still handy features that can help combat distracted driving. What about the color -coded roads on Google Maps that warn of delays? And the Waze app, which warns of the police and accidents ahead?

Thats partly why I will grab my phone for around-town jaunts. The accuracy of Google Maps traffic is awesome. My wife will be checking it as Im driving and will say, right around this bend, it turns red. And sure enough, the traffic slows way down right at that spot. GPS devices provide traffic warnings, and a lot of them also now connect to a phone via Bluetooth for live traffic, but they dont measure up to Google or Waze in that regard. The better GPS units have better onscreen directions, especially at tricky interchanges, and they have more precise voice directions. While most navigation systems say Turn on such-and-such street. Garmins, for example, now say, Turn at the traffic light or even at the red building. This landmark-type voice guidance makes it easier to find your turn, especially when its not easy to see the street signs. How do you test all the different GPS device models? While weve compared the specs and features for more than 100 models, weve done three rounds of hands-on testing with about 20. Most of the nitty-gritty testing is done over weeks inside a car while we use the units for everyday driving.

Thats a challenge. I now record those sessions with a GoPro camera, so I can better keep my eyes on the road.   Follow Damon Darlin on Twitter @darlin .

AUTO INDUSTRY A likely uptick in new-car sales may mask a weak market. Auto manufacturers on Monday are set to report new car sales for March, and a rise of about 2 percent from March 2016 is expected , to around 1.6 million light vehicles. But analysts warn that the increase may be masking market weakness. Edmunds.com has noted that inventories have risen to their highest level in more than a decade, incentives are rising and loan terms are lengthening  all indications that sales arent coming as easily as they have in the past few years. And even with a rise in March, sales in the first quarter are likely to be flat compared with a year earlier. Neal E. Boudette ECONOMY The Feds top regulator heads for retirement after one more speech. The Federal Reserve governor Daniel Tarullo does not have celebrity status, but for the past eight years he has been the nations most important financial regulator  the Feds point man on strengthening financial regulation in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis. He plans to retire this week, but he will give one more speech, on Tuesday at Princeton University . With the Trump administration threatening to dismantle much of his work, Mr. Tarullo is not likely to miss the chance to mount a final defense of the need for financial regulation. Binyamin Appelbaum BANKING The Chase chiefs annual letter to shareholders is due on Tuesday. On Tuesday morning, Jamie Dimon, the chief executive of JPMorgan Chase, is expected to release his annual letter to shareholders . Over the years, the letter has become a must-read for many in the business world. Warren E. Buffett, the billionaire investor, is said to be among the fans of Mr. Dimons yearly musings on the economy, regulations and, of course, banking. This year, investors will be looking to see whether Mr. Dimon weighs in on the Trump administrations big policy initiatives, like rolling back free trade and corporate taxes. Michael Corkery ECONOMY The Feds actions in March point to confidence in recovery. The Federal Reserve raised its benchmark interest rate in March for the third time since the financial crisis, a sign of confidence in the health of the economic recovery. The question now is how many more times the Fed plans to raise rates this year. The Feds latest round of forecasts, also published in March, still predicts three increases . But some Fed officials say a fourth rise may be necessary as growth chugs along and inflation picks up. The Fed will add another dollop of information on Wednesday when it publishes an account of the March meeting. Binyamin Appelbaum TRADE POLICY Trump will meet the Chinese president over two days. President Trumps meeting with President Xi Jinping of China at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida on Thursday and Friday leaves both sides with difficult choices about whether to emphasize geopolitical priorities or bilateral trade goals. The United States wants Chinas help in confronting North Korea, while China wants the United States to play a lesser role in the South China Sea and Taiwan. But the United States also wants China to reduce its many barriers to imports, curb subsidies to exporters and stop forcing foreign companies to transfer technology to Chinese competitors as a condition for entering the Chinese market. And China wants America to limit anti-dumping and anti-subsidy cases against Chinese companies by labeling China a market economy, and wants Mr. Trump to stop emphasizing the bilateral trade deficit. Mr. Trump signed an executive order on Friday calling for the government to study trade problems exhaustively for the next 90 days. Demanding an in-depth study buys time for the administration to seek Senate confirmation of appointees to a long list of unfilled trade policy-making posts, then decide what its exact trade priorities will be. Keith Bradsher ECONOMY March data will probably show a slight hiring slowdown. On Friday at 8:30 a.m., the Labor Department will release data on unemployment and hiring in March. Economists are looking for a gain of 180,000 jobs for the month, and for the unemployment rate to remain 4.7 percent. After unexpectedly robust gains of 238,000 jobs in January and 235,000 in February , experts expect data to show that March hiring, though still healthy, was slower. The survey week for data coincided with Marchs winter storm in much of the country, which could skew the figures. Nelson D.

California was one of four states examined in a new report on insurance rates.   Credit Richard Vogel/Associated Press     A new analysis of car insurance in four states found that drivers living in some minority neighborhoods were charged higher rates than similar drivers in mostly white areas, even when the average risk of a claim was similar. The report , by the nonprofits ProPublica and Consumer Reports, covers rates in California, Illinois, Missouri and Texas, the states that made data available. The report examined quoted insurance premiums, as well as average claims paid by insurers  the first use of payout data to examine racial disparities in car insurance premiums, the researchers said. The analysis found that pricing disparities between neighborhoods that were mostly white and those inhabited mostly by minorities were wider than differences in risk could explain. In some cases, the report said, major insurers charged premiums that were on average 30 percent higher in minority ZIP codes than in comparable nonminority neighborhoods. This overpricing, the report said, may amount to a subtler form of redlining, a term that refers to denial of services to minority areas. The report, published Wednesday by Consumer Reports, said it was not entirely clear why insurers charged more in minority areas. It could represent a vestige of the days when racial discrimination by businesses was routine, researchers said, or it might be that proprietary algorithms used by individual insurers inadvertently penalized minority areas.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   However, It raises the question of whether those rates are justified, said Julia Angwin, a senior reporter at ProPublica and one of the reports authors.  Continue reading the main story         Advertisement   Continue reading the main story       The study looked at premium quotes for liability insurance, which covers bodily injury and property damage and is required in nearly all states. It also examined several years of data on average claims paid out in every ZIP code in the four states. ProPublica, an investigative news organization, said it submitted freedom of information requests to all 50 states and the District of Columbia, and just those four said they collected such data. The insurance industry and some state regulators criticized the report, saying it oversimplified the way companies set rates. Insurance companies do not discriminate on the basis of race, James Lynch, chief actuary of the Insurance Information Institute, a trade group, told the researchers. In a call with reporters on Wednesday, Mr. Lynch said the institute had commissioned its own actuarial analysis of ProPublicas data and determined that the conclusions drawn from the study were flawed. The institute did not make its analysis available because it was in draft form, he said, but expected to make it available when the report was completed. This is a very, very serious charge being made on a very weak study, he said. Asked if the discrepancies could result from an unintended consequence of the formulas used to set rates, Mr. Lynch said, There is no unfair discrimination, intentional or unintentional. Because individual insurers do not publicly release their losses on a ZIP code level, the analysis is based on aggregated losses by insurers. The California Department of Insurance dismissed that approach as flawed, the report said, saying an individual insurers losses in a given area may vary significantly from the industry average. ProPublica said that while a given companys losses could deviate from average losses experienced by insurers, it was unlikely that the differences would result in a consistent pattern of higher prices for minority neighborhoods. The report resonated with consumer advocates. Im not surprised by the findings, said Robert Hunter, director of insurance at the Consumer Federation of America. The federation has conducted a series of studies raising questions about the fairness of using nondriving criteria, like education and occupation, in setting auto insurance rates. In 2015, the federation published a study finding that rates are much higher in minority ZIP codes.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   The federations studies did not include insurer payout data, which is good addition to the analysis, Mr. Hunter said. Fairness in setting auto insurance rates is crucial, he said, because liability coverage is usually mandatory and because people rely on their cars to get to work. Since insurance is regulated primarily by states, he urged consumers to contact their state insurance regulators to ask them to examine the fairness of rate-setting practices. Contacts by state are available at the National Association of Insurance Commissioners website. Here are some questions and answers about car insurance rates: How can I find more affordable rates on my car insurance? Individuals must aggressively comparison shop, experts say. Consumer Reports suggests using TheZebra.com, an online tool that offers estimates from a dozen or more insurers, depending on the state. Drivers should compare rates often, said Tobie Stanger, a senior editor at the magazine, because the supposed benefit of getting a discount by remaining with the same insurer for a long time is mostly a myth. Typically, one or two insurers will offer lower rates in a given state. The magazines website offers a list of which insurers to check first, by state. Can I lower my auto premium by raising my policys deductible? Yes. Increasing your deductible  the amount you must pay before your insurance policy does  can help lower monthly premiums. Just be aware that if you have a claim, you will be responsible for more of the cost of any repairs. What if I dont drive very much? Mr. Hunter said he considered mileage to be an underreflected characteristic in setting auto insurance rates, but some insurers are starting to weigh it more heavily. So if you dont drive much, you might be able to lower your premium. So-called pay-per-mile policies from Metromile , for instance, charge a monthly base premium, plus an additional rate based on the number of miles you drive each month. The company installs a device in your car to track mileage.   Email: yourmoneyadviser@nytimes.com    Continue reading the main story        Were interested in your feedback on this page.

Each Saturday, Farhad Manjoo and Mike Isaac, technology reporters at The New York Times, review the weeks news , offering analysis and maybe a joke or two about the most important developments in the tech industry. Farhad: Hey, Mike! How goes it? I tried a weird sleep experiment this week. I slept from 10 p.m. to 3 a.m., and then again from 9 a.m. to 11 a.m. I love the super-early morning hours before my kids wake up. I find I get more stuff done then. And who doesnt like a daily nap? Mike: That sounds like me in college. You havent also started beer-bonging cases of Keystone Light, too, have you? Because, um, studies have shown that it is not great for you. And by studies I mean my freshman year grade point average. Farhad: O.K., heres what happened in tech. Twitter rolled out an update that was universally panned by people on Twitter. That happens every time Twitter rolls out an update, but this time the update was actually bad. Twitter stopped counting user names against the 140-character limit (if you dont get what that means, dont worry), which resulted in people being able to create huge chains of Twitter spam aimed at other people. As Sarah Jeong writes in Motherboard, its a really terrible implementation that makes you wonder if anyone at Twitter even uses Twitter.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   Mike: I came online after a day of working and literally could not understand what Twitter did or how to use it, on the desktop at least. It seems like Im talking to myself in a vacuum when I tweet. Which, coincidentally, is pretty much how I use the service anyway. So I guess I dont mind it?  Continue reading the main story         Advertisement   Continue reading the main story       Farhad: What are these people thinking? I mean, sure, Twitter is under pressure to attract new users, and the old format did clog up text with a bunch of @symbols @that @only @made @sense to the initiated. But the fix they chose creates more problems than it solves. Mike: Maybe its one of those things like when were writing a story and stare at a terribly written sentence long enough that it begins to make sense. I bet you strongly relate to that one. Farhad: Wow, thanks. O.K., lets turn to another social network. Facebook intensified its all-out assault on Snapchat this week by implementing Stories in its own app. For those counting at home, that means all of Facebooks social apps  Instagram, WhatsApp, Messenger and now the blue app  let you create a disappearing video diary of your day. Mike: I dont use any of them, and still use Snapchats Stories function. Does that make me weird? I guess Im averse to major change. Which is why I order the same thing every time I go to a restaurant. Does that make me weird, too?  Newsletter Sign Up  Continue reading the main story  Interested in All Things Tech?

Weve talked about the frighteningly effective brazenness with which Facebook copies its competitors before. I dont really know what to say other than I stand in horrified awe. Weve just witnessed a pilfering on a historic scale. Snapchats Stories is one of the most interesting and original new social features in years, but in the long run its Facebook and its subsidiaries that may end up enjoying the most of this innovation. No one ever said the tech business was fair, I guess. Mike: On the other hand, the argument I keep hearing is that its not about being first, but about executing best. And honestly, Instagram Stories is pretty well done. I may not use it, but I certainly appreciate it. One thing I wonder is how these employees fill their Stories with new fun stuff all the time. Theyre pretty much forced to look like theyre living an amazing life at all hours in order to test the product. But if I were constantly filming Stories? It would be me hunched over my laptop, shoveling Indian food into my mouth.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   Does that make me weird? Farhad: Look, weve been over this. Yes. Finally, can you fill me in on what on earth just happened with Google and Uber? Waymo, the self-driving car unit of Googles parent company, Alphabet, is suing Uber for what it says is theft of its technology. Something amazing happened in that case this week. Anthony Levandowski, the Uber engineer at the center of the lawsuit , invoked his Fifth Amendment rights against self-incrimination in a response to a request to turn over documents in the case. Ubers lawyers recommended that he hand over the documents, but Mr. Levandowski disagreed, apparently. Am I missing something or is this very, very bad for Uber and the future of its self-driving program? Mike: So heres the big thing about this. We have to delineate the differing interests here. Ubers lawyers are trying to protect Uber. While Levandowski, who has hired his own counsel who specialize in defending against white-collar criminal offenses, has Levandowskis best interests at heart. Those two interests are not necessarily aligned. And as we saw this week, Levandowskis opting not to provide some evidence might actually hurt Uber (though Ubers lawyers say they can prove Uber is innocent even without Levandowskis help). Anyway, the whole thing is a complete mess. But its fascinating to watch Uber and Levandowski slowly disentangle themselves from each other in public view. Im not sure what that means for self-driving initiatives at Uber. But if they are served with an injunction to stop working on driverless cars until the case is seen through, theres going to be about 1,000 Uber engineers with a whole lot of nothing to do. O.K., thats enough out of me. I hope you get some better sleep this weekend! Farhad: Im headed off to bed right now, in fact. See you!

The company has lost its fight to appeal a judges decision concerning a search warrant.   Credit Jeff Chiu/Associated Press     Internet civil liberties advocates did not get the news they wanted from New Yorks top court on Tuesday. Facebook hit the end of the line in a long fight with New York prosecutors when the State Court of Appeals, in a 5-to-1 ruling, upheld lower court rulings that New York law does not allow a social media company to appeal a judges decision to issue search warrants in a criminal case. Facebook had argued that it should have a right to appeal such decisions, particularly if the company believes those warrants violate the constitutional rights of its users, as James C. McKinley Jr. writes .  Newsletter Sign Up  Continue reading the main story  Interested in All Things Tech?

In recent years, prosecutors have become more aggressive about asking for so-called bulk warrant orders. These sometimes come with open-ended requests for access to users data, meaning there is little or no time limit involved.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   Internet companies argue that these open-ended requests, which often come with gag orders prohibiting the companies from informing users about the warrants, are excessive. But law enforcement officials argue that the companies, as service providers, have no standing in court to argue against the warrants. In addition, prosecutors say they often need the gag orders to prevent their targets from learning that they are under investigation. For now, at least, the courts are siding with law enforcement.

Her accomplishments at the Bedford Hills Correctional Facility, which I have witnessed, are extraordinary, including her work on the staff of the Nursery Program, her efforts to address the effect of the AIDS epidemic in prison, and her success helping rebuild a prison college program when public funding was eliminated. Parole causes great pain to many victims and their families. But where there has been ample punishment, proof of rehabilitation, acceptance of responsibility and genuine remorse, the door of mercy must remain open. If Ms. Clark is denied parole, what does that say to all the other women and men in prison who strive to become better and transformed human beings? At 67 and after 35 years in prison, Judith Clark is among the oldest and longest serving women in prison in New York State. It is time for her to be released.

The dead included a famous doll maker and a beloved wrestling coach.   Credit Dmitri Lovetsky/Associated Press     ST. PETERSBURG, Russia  The 14 people who died in a terrorist attack on the St. Petersburg subway were a cross section of the city, caught in the wrong place at the wrong time. There was a famous doll maker whose creations with often crazy hair were beloved by collectors, and who apparently saved her daughters life by shielding her as a bomb erupted deep underground around 2:40 p.m. on Monday. There was a young wrestling coach adored by his team. When he did not appear for practice as scheduled and did not answer his cellphone, people posted pictures of him and his distinctive tattoos on social media, refusing to believe that he could have been swept away so suddenly and so young. There were many students  some finished for the day, some playing hooky, many making plans that were abruptly, catastrophically cut short.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   I feel lost now, said Mikhail A. Veprentsev, 18, one of more than 60 people injured, summing up the mood of those whose loved ones died and those who made it out of the subway train that was struck by a young suicide bomber. I am just glad I was alone, without friends or relatives.  Continue reading the main story         Advertisement   Continue reading the main story       The doll maker, Irina Medyantseva, 50, was not alone. She and her grown daughter Yelena, also a doll designer, had just boarded the third carriage of the train at Sennaya Station when the terrorist struck. Relatives told Komsomolskaya Pravda, a tabloid, that the mother had protected the daughter, who ended up in intensive care.  Photo        Irina Medyantseva, in a picture taken from social media.    Mrs. Medyantseva was famous in St. Petersburg, Russias second-largest city and imperial capital, for making dolls for the past 15 years. Her creations sported big eyes, big grins and droopy clothes, a little vulnerable and a little unconventional. Photographs of Mrs. Medyantseva showed her in her garden or donning big glasses to look a bit like one of her dolls. Catastrophe, wrote her husband, Alexander Kaminsky, on his page on Vkontakte, the Russian equivalent of Facebook. Ive lost my beloved wife. After the explosion, his daughter called him briefly to recount what happened before she was whisked to the hospital. The wrestling coach, Denis R. Petrov, 25, had been an assistant coach for children at a club called Warrior since September. He was a stocky blond with numerous tattoos  a dark blue Polynesian design across one shoulder, English phrases up both forearms and burst of color on his right wrist. His left arm read Better to reign, while the right said, Step by Step. He had called in the morning to say he would be there around 3 p.m., and when he did not appear, his colleagues began making a series of frantic telephone calls to try to find him. We didnt want to believe that he had died, one told the newspaper Moskovsky Komsomolets. Kirill Mikhailov, the father of one of the children he coached, wrote on Mr. Petrovs Vkontakte page, My sons wrestling coach and simply a good person Denis Romanovich Petrov died in the terrorist attack in the Petersburg metro, he was all of 25 years old!!! He will remain in our memories forever! Dilbara S. Aliyeva was one of the students killed. She was in her third year at Emperor Alexander I St. Petersburg State Transport University. On its website, the university announced the death and reported that 12 more of its students were injured.  Photo        Dilbara S. Aliyeva    Ms. Aliyeva  whose pictures show a woman with long black hair  was studying at the faculty of economics and management. She wanted to become a psychologist, the statement said.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   Like any girl, she had friends, was making big plans, loved life, it said. Ms. Aliyeva was originally from Baku, Azerbaijan, but had moved to St. Petersburg with her family and completed high school there.           She posted a picture from a hipster cafe on her Instagram account in late January saying, You can take the girl out of Petersburg but you can never take Petersburg out of the girl. Another student, Maksim Aryshev, 19, a native of Kazakhstan, was so close to the blast that at first there were reports  given the fears about suicide attackers from Central Asia  that he had been the bomber.  Photo        Maksim Aryshev    Mr. Aryshev, a third-year student at St. Petersburg State University of Economics, wanted to be a programmer. A classmate described him to the Meduza news website as cheerful and sociable, a man who loved to joke and the life of any party. There was at least one mystery among the dead. Angelina Svistunova, 27, described as the wife of a military man, was said to have spent most days at home. Her family was mystified as to why she was on the metro in the middle of the day, according to Moskovsky Komsomolets. Finally, there was the bomber himself: Akbarzhon Dzhalilov , 22, a member of the Uzbek minority in the troubled city of Osh, in southern Kyrgyzstan, who came to St. Petersburg six years ago after obtaining Russian citizenship through his father.

About the only signs of radicalization were a few links to Islamist websites on his social media pages, and one source told Interfax that he seemed to have returned from a rare visit home in February a changed man  sullen and withdrawn. How he became radicalized  yet another in a line of lone wolves that have left a bloody trail around the globe  is part of the investigation. His father and mother arrived in St. Petersburg on Wednesday to identify the body and to speak with investigators. I do not believe it, was all the mother told reporters upon arrival, according to Interfax.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   The names of the deceased have dribbled out slowly; the list was still incomplete by Wednesday morning, and the families were supposed to begin receiving their remains later in the day. Their relatives, as well as the injured, were mostly being shielded from public view at the various hospitals to which they were admitted. Dozens remained hospitalized. Mr. Veprentsev, lying under a blanket at City Hospital No. 26 in St. Petersburg, answered a steady stream of telephone calls from friends inquiring about his health. The young man was injured after he decided at the last minute to skip an afternoon class and go back home, dashing across the platform to the fateful train. He was in an adjacent car when the door blew in on him. I was shocked. I threw the door away from me and began to crawl through this whole mess, he said. The dead around him had screws sticking out of their heads, he said, apparently part of the shrapnel in the bomb. At first he went home, but, feeling ill, he was taken to the hospital by a friend. Doctors determined he had a concussion, multiple injuries, trauma inside his chest and glass injuries across his back. Opposite him in the same tiny room, also under a blanket, lay Konstantin Y. Kolodkin, 40, a well-built man with a dark mustache who installs car alarms for a living. He had been on the way home from work and said he did not remember which car he had entered when suddenly there was a blast. I jumped out of the car like the cork out of bottle, he said, then walked around dazed for while before going to the hospital, where he was found to have a concussion and multiple injuries. The car was full. I would say about 70 percent full for sure, students going home or going to classes, said Mr. Kolodkin, who repeatedly criticized the government security measures that let a bomber slip through. I just dont know how I will be able to go down to use the metro again.   Follow Ivan Nechepurenko @INechepurenko and Neil MacFarquhar @NeilMacFarquhar on Twitter .

Boudette April 2, 2017 Tesla, the electric-car maker, on Sunday reported strong year-on-year jumps in vehicle deliveries and production in the first quarter, although it still must navigate a key challenge later this year to hit the ambitious targets that its chief executive, Elon Musk, has set for 2018. The company said it delivered more than 25,000 cars and sport utility vehicles in the first quarter, a rise of about 69 percent from the same period a year ago. The increase from the fourth quarter was smaller, however. In the final quarter of 2016, Tesla delivered 22,252 cars and S.U.V.s. The first-quarter total is a preliminary figure that could change when the company reports its first-quarter earnings next month. Tesla also said it produced a record 25,418 vehicles in the quarter, up from 15,510 a year ago, although again the rise was much smaller when compared with the fourth quarter, when it built 24,882 cars. The company currently offers the Model S luxury sedan and the Model X S.U.V. , both of which can sell for $90,000 or more once options are included. In July, it plans to begin production of the Model 3  a compact car the company hopes to sell for $35,000 and produce in significantly higher volume. Mr. Musk has said that with the Model 3 in the mix, the company is aiming to push annual production to 500,000 cars in 2018. At that rate, Tesla would need to average production of more than 40,000 cars a month, more than it now produces in a quarter. Sales have been good for Tesla in the last three months, but the Model 3 will be their biggest challenge yet as I imagine most of their company resources are focused on that vehicle, said Jessica Caldwell, a senior analyst at Edmunds.com, an auto-information website. Such a rapid expansion would tax even long-established automakers, and Tesla is moving forward with the Model 3 while taking on other challenges. It just began production at a gigantic battery plant  known as the Gigafactory  in Nevada, and last year it merged with SolarCity , a maker of solar panels that had Mr. Musk as its chairman and a shareholder. At the same time, Teslas automobile business faces some uncertainty because sales are currently helped by a $7,500 tax credit the federal government offers on environmentally friendly cars. A worry on the horizon is the Trump administrations stance on the tax credits, Ms. Caldwell said.
