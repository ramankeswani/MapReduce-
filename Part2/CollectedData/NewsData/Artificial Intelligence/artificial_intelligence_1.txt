Credit Guerin Blask for The New York Times     In its first steps toward commercialization, IBM s Watson took on grand, science-laden challenges like helping doctors diagnose cancer. But that is changing as IBM strives to build its artificial intelligence technology into a multibillion-dollar business. Today, companies including Geico, Staples and Macys are adding the Watson technology to answer customer questions or to improve mobile apps that guide shoppers through stores. Now in its broadest deployment so far, Watson will be assisting H&R Block s 70,000 tax professionals this filing season at 10,000 branch offices across the country, where 11 million people file taxes. The H&R Block partnership with Watson, announced on Wednesday, is being presented to a wider audience with a 60-second television ad during the Super Bowl on Sunday.

Watson will touch consumers, but through IBMs corporate clients.

The embedded-in-business formula is different from the path other technology companies are taking with digital assistants powered by artificial intelligence. Others are pursuing the broad consumer market directly with artificial intelligence software helpers like Siri from Apple, Cortana from Microsoft, Alexa from Amazon and Assistant from Google.

Credit Yana Paskova for The New York Times    In the corporate technology market, the major companies are racing to get on the artificial intelligence bandwagon, though they lack the early lead and powerful branding of Watson. Data-fueled artificial intelligence will be an ingredient in all kinds of software used in corporations, to streamline work, identify new customers, spot savings and guide product development, analysts say. By 2018, the research company IDC predicts that 75 percent of new business software will include artificial intelligence features. A.I. is becoming part of the mix, part of the infrastructure in consumer and business applications, said David Schubmehl, an IDC analyst. IBM is also banking on Watson as an engine of its corporate transformation. The company needs its new businesses like Watson, data analysis and cloud computing to more than make up for the erosion in its traditional hardware and software products. That has not happened yet. Two weeks ago, IBM reported its 19th consecutive quarter of declining revenue.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   But there were encouraging signs in the last quarter of 2016. IBM executives noted that the companys newer businesses, including Watson, grew by 14 percent to represent 41 percent of total revenue. That was ahead of IBMs previous forecast that the 40 percent of revenue threshold would not be reached until 2018. The H&R Block collaboration suggests that IBM is getting better at working with partners. Some of the early Watson projects stretched out for years partly because of poor communications between IBM and its clients. But when Bill Cobb, chief executive of H&R Block, contacted IBM last summer, saying he wanted to use Watson to help reinvent the retail experience for taxpayers, he heard what he called a candid assessment, not a sales pitch.  Photo        Philip Cameron, master tax adviser with H&R Block in Manhattan, organized documents after a meeting with a client on Tuesday.   Credit Yana Paskova for The New York Times    This is not magic, Mr. Cobb said the Watson team told him. You have to teach Watson over time. Watson proved to be a quick learner. Its core skill is its ability to digest and classify vast amounts of text, using what is known as natural language processing. So, among other things, it was fed the 74,000 pages of the federal tax code and thousands of tax-related questions culled from H&R Blocks data, accumulated over six decades of preparing tax returns. Then, H&R Block tax professionals were brought in to train Watson. They approved when Watson suggested a smart question for a particular tax filer and corrected it when a proposed question was off base. The tax professionals were not told they were working with Watson, just a software program.

One goal, Mr. Cobb said, is to assist H&R Blocks tax professionals and improve their chances of fairly increasing refunds and reducing tax liabilities for clients. Seventy-five percent of Americans who file taxes get money back. For H&R Block clients, the figure is about 85 percent, Mr. Cobb said. But Watsons other task was to make visiting H&R Block a more engaging and interactive experience, he said. Clients will be able to watch suggestions and questions on a separate screen, as the Watson-assisted tax professional works. Mr. Cobb said he was very pleased with Watsons performance in the 100-office trial. But the test will come after this tax season, when H&R Block sees what percentage of customers return next year.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   The retention rate is crucial in the tax-preparation business. Sixty percent of the 140 million Americans who file taxes seek help instead of doing them themselves. Kartik Mehta, an analyst at Northcoast Research, estimates that H&R Blocks retention rate is 75 percent. If they can get that 75 percent up to 80 percent, its a big deal for H&R Block, Mr. Mehta said. The Watson collaboration is a long-term partnership, Mr. Cobb said. Mr. Kenny of IBM described this tax season as phase one of the partnership. Over time, Watsons suggestions get better and better, more individually tailored to specific occupations, household finances and personal circumstances. Its crawl, walk, run learning, Mr. Kenny said. But the pace of the Watson learning is so much faster than humans.

The new supercomputer is thought to be part of a broader Chinese push to begin driving innovation.   Credit Li Xiang/Xinhua, via Associated Press     Robert O. Work, the veteran defense official retained as deputy secretary by President Trump, calls them his A.I. dudes. The breezy moniker belies their serious task: The dudes have been a kitchen cabinet of sorts, and have advised Mr. Work as he has sought to reshape warfare by bringing artificial intelligence to the battlefield. Last spring, he asked, O.K., you guys are the smartest guys in A.I., right? No, the dudes told him, the smartest guys are at Facebook and Google, Mr. Work recalled in an interview. Now, increasingly, theyre also in China. The United States no longer has a strategic monopoly on the technology, which is widely seen as the key factor in the next generation of warfare. The Pentagons plan to bring A.I. to the military is taking shape as Chinese researchers assert themselves in the nascent technology field. And that shift is reflected in surprising commercial advances in artificial intelligence among Chinese companies.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   Last year, for example, Microsoft researchers proclaimed that the company had created software capable of matching human skills in understanding speech.  Continue reading the main story         Advertisement   Continue reading the main story       Although they boasted that they had outperformed their United States competitors, a well-known A.I. researcher who leads a Silicon Valley laboratory for the Chinese web services company Baidu gently taunted Microsoft, noting that Baidu had achieved similar accuracy with the Chinese language two years earlier. That, in a nutshell, is the challenge the United States faces as it embarks on a new military strategy founded on the assumption of its continued superiority in technologies such as robotics and artificial intelligence. First announced last year by Ashton B. Carter , President Barack Obamas defense secretary, the Third Offset strategy provides a formula for maintaining a military advantage in the face of a renewed rivalry with China and Russia. Well into the 1960s, the United States held a military advantage based on technological leadership in nuclear weapons . In the 1970s, that perceived lead shifted to smart weapons, based on brand-new Silicon Valley technologies like computer chips. Now, the nations leaders plan on retaining that military advantage with a significant commitment to artificial intelligence and robotic weapons. But the global technology balance of power is shifting. From the 1950s through the 1980s, the United States carefully guarded its advantage. It led the world in computer and material science technology, and it jealously hoarded its leadership with military secrecy and export controls. In the late 1980s, the emergence of the inexpensive and universally available microchip upended the Pentagons ability to control technological progress. Now, rather than trickling down from military and advanced corporate laboratories, todays new technologies increasingly come from consumer electronics firms. Put simply, the companies that make the fastest computers are the same ones that put things under our Christmas trees. As consumer electronics manufacturing has moved to Asia, both Chinese companies and the nations government laboratories are making major investments in artificial intelligence.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   The advance of the Chinese was underscored last month when Qi Lu, a veteran Microsoft artificial intelligence specialist, left the company to become chief operating officer at Baidu, where he will oversee the companys ambitious plan to become a global leader in A.I. And last year, Tencent, developer of the mobile app WeChat, a Facebook competitor, created an artificial intelligence research laboratory and began investing in United States-based A.I. companies. Rapid Chinese progress has touched off a debate in the United States between military strategists and technologists over whether the Chinese are merely imitating advances or are engaged in independent innovation that will soon overtake the United States in the field. The Chinese leadership is increasingly thinking about how to ensure they are competitive in the next wave of technologies, said Adam Segal, a specialist in emerging technologies and national security at the Council on Foreign Relations. In August, the state-run China Daily reported that the country had embarked on the development of a cruise missile system with a high level of artificial intelligence. The new system appears to be a response to a missile the United States Navy is expected to deploy in 2018 to counter growing Chinese military influence in the Pacific. Known as the Long Range Anti- Ship Missile , or L.R.A.S.M., it is described as a semiautonomous weapon. According to the Pentagon, this means that though targets are chosen by human soldiers, the missile uses artificial intelligence technology to avoid defenses and make final targeting decisions. The new Chinese weapon typifies a strategy known as remote warfare, said John Arquilla, a military strategist at the Naval Post Graduate School in Monterey, Calif. The idea is to build large fleets of small ships that deploy missiles, to attack an enemy with larger ships, like aircraft carriers. They are making their machines more creative, he said. A little bit of automation gives the machines a tremendous boost.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   Whether or not the Chinese will quickly catch the United States in artificial intelligence and robotics technologies is a matter of intense discussion and disagreement in the United States. Andrew Ng, chief scientist at Baidu, said the United States may be too myopic and self-confident to understand the speed of the Chinese competition. There are many occasions of something being simultaneously invented in China and elsewhere, or being invented first in China and then later making it overseas, he said. But then U.S. media reports only on the U.S. version. This leads to a misperception of those ideas having been first invented in the U.S.  Photo        Robert O.

Clapper Jr., the former director of national intelligence, center, and Marcel Lettre, under secretary of defense for intelligence, in November. Mr. Work is trying to bring artificial intelligence to the battlefield.   Credit Al Drago/The New York Times    A key example of Chinese progress that goes largely unreported in the United States is Iflytek , an artificial intelligence company that has focused on speech recognition and understanding natural language. The company has won international competitions both in speech synthesis and in translation between Chinese- and English-language texts. The company, which Chinese technologists said has a close relationship with the government for development of surveillance technology, said it is working with the Ministry of Science and Technology on a Humanoid Answering Robot. Our goal is to send the machine to attend the college entrance examination, and to be admitted by key national universities in the near future, said Qingfeng Liu, Iflyteks chief executive.

Last April, Gansha Wu, then the director of Intels laboratory in China, left his post and began assembling a team of researchers from Intel and Google to build a self-driving car company. Last month, the company, Uisee Technology, met its goal  taking a demonstration to the International Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas  after just nine months of work. The A.I. technologies, including machine vision, sensor fusion, planning and control, on our car are completely home-brewed, Mr. Wu said. We wrote every line by ourselves. Their first vehicle is intended for controlled environments like college and corporate campuses, with the ultimate goal of designing a shared fleet of autonomous taxis.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   The United States view of Chinas advance may be starting to change. Last October, a White House report on artificial intelligence included several footnotes suggesting that China is now publishing more research than scholars here. Still, some scientists say the quantity of academic papers does not tell us much about innovation. And there are indications that China has only recently begun to make A.I. a priority in its military systems. I think while China is definitely making progress in A.I. systems, it is nowhere close to matching the U.S., said Abhijit Singh , a former Indian military officer who is now a naval weapons analyst at the Observer Research Foundation in New Delhi. Chinese researchers who are directly involved in artificial intelligence work in China have a very different view. It is indisputable that Chinese authors are a significant force in A.I., and their position has been increasing drastically in the past five years, said Kai-Fu Lee, a Taiwanese-born artificial intelligence researcher who played a key role in establishing both Microsofts and Googles China-based research laboratories. Mr. Lee, now a venture capitalist who invests in both China and the United States, acknowledged that the United States is still the global leader but believes that the gap has drastically narrowed. His firm, Sinovation Ventures, has recently raised $675 million to invest in A.I. both in the United States and in China. Using a chess analogy, he said, we might say that grandmasters are still largely North American, but Chinese occupy increasingly greater portions of the master-level A.I. scientists. What is not in dispute is that the close ties between Silicon Valley and China both in terms of investment and research, and the open nature of much of the American A.I. research community, has made the most advanced technology easily available to China.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   In addition to setting up research outposts such as Baidus Silicon Valley A.I. Laboratory, Chinese citizens, including government employees, routinely audit Stanford University artificial intelligence courses. One Stanford professor, Richard Socher, said it was easy to spot the Chinese nationals because after the first few weeks, his students would often skip class, choosing instead to view videos of the lectures. The Chinese auditors, on the other hand, would continue to attend, taking their seats at the front of the classroom. Artificial intelligence is only one part of the tech frontier where China is advancing rapidly. Last year, China also brought the worlds fastest supercomputer, the Sunway TaihuLight , online, supplanting another Chinese model that had been the worlds fastest. The new supercomputer is thought to be part of a broader Chinese push to begin driving innovation, a shift from its role as a manufacturing hub for components and devices designed in the United States and elsewhere. In a reflection of the desire to become a center of innovation, the processors in the new computer are of a native Chinese design. The earlier supercomputer, the Tianhe 2, was powered by Intels Xeon processors; after it came online, the United States banned further export of the chips to China, in hopes of limiting the Chinese push into supercomputing. The new supercomputer, like similar machines anywhere in the world, has a variety of uses, and does not by itself represent a direct military challenge. It can be used to model climate change situations, for instance, or to perform analysis of large data sets. But similar advances in high-performance computing being made by the Chinese could be used to push ahead with machine-learning research, which would have military applications, along with more typical defense functions, such as simulating nuclear weapons tests or breaking the encryption used by adversaries. Moreover, while there appear to be relatively cozy relationships between the Chinese government and commercial technology efforts, the same cannot be said about the United States. The Pentagon recently restarted its beachhead in Silicon Valley, known as the Defense Innovation Unit Experimental facility , or DIUx. It is an attempt to rethink bureaucratic United States government contracting practices in terms of the faster and more fluid style of Silicon Valley. The government has not yet undone the damage to its relationship with the Valley brought about by Edward J. Snowdens revelations about the National Security Agencys surveillance practices. Many Silicon Valley firms remain hesitant to be seen as working too closely with the Pentagon out of fear of losing access to Chinas market. There are smaller companies, the companies who sort of decided that theyre going to be in the defense business, like a Palantir, said Peter W. Singer, an expert in the future of war at New America, a think tank in Washington, referring to the Palo Alto, Calif., start-up founded in part by the venture capitalist Peter Thiel . But if youre thinking about the big, iconic tech companies, they cant become defense contractors and still expect to get access to the Chinese market.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   Those concerns are real for Silicon Valley. No one sort of overtly says that, because the Pentagon cant say its about China, and the tech companies cant, Mr. Singer said. But its there in the background.

Credit via YouTube     Updated March 13, 2018: President Trump announced that he had ousted Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson and intended to replace him with Mike Pompeo, now the C.I.A. director. Mr. Trump also named Gina Haspel a s his c hoice  to become the next C.I.A. director. WASHINGTON  As a clandestine officer at the Central Intelligence Agency in 2002, Gina Haspel oversaw the torture of a terrorism suspect and later took part in an order to destroy videotapes documenting the brutal interrogations at a secret prison in Thailand. On Thursday, Ms. Haspel was named the deputy director of the C.I.A. The elevation of Ms. Haspel, a veteran widely respected among her colleagues, to the No. 2 job at the C.I.A. was a rare public signal of how, under the Trump administration, the agency is being led by officials who appear to take a far kinder view of one of its darker chapters than their immediate predecessors. Over the past eight years, C.I.A. leaders defended dozens of agency personnel who had taken part in the now-banned torture program, even as they vowed never to resume the same harsh interrogation methods. But President Trump has said repeatedly that he thinks torture works. And the new C.I.A. chief , Mike Pompeo, has said that waterboarding and other techniques do not even constitute torture, and praised as patriots those who used such methods in the early days of the fight against Al Qaeda.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   Ms. Haspel, who has spent most of her career undercover, would certainly fall within Mr. Pompeos description. She played a direct role in the C.I.A.s extraordinary rendition program, under which captured militants were handed to foreign governments and held at secret facilities, where they were tortured by agency personnel.

Credit Doug Mills/The New York Times    Another detainee, Abu Zubaydah, was tortured at the site before Ms. Haspel took charge. He was waterboarded 83 times in a single month, had his head repeatedly slammed into walls and endured other harsh methods before interrogators decided he had no useful information to provide. The sessions were videotaped and the recordings stored in a safe at the C.I.A. station in Thailand until 2005, when they were ordered destroyed . By then, Ms. Haspel was serving at C.I.A. headquarters, and it was her name that was on the cable carrying the destruction orders. The agency maintains that the decision to destroy the recordings was made by Ms. Haspels boss at the time, Jose Rodriguez, who was the head of the C.I.A.s clandestine service. But years later, when the C.I.A. wanted to name Ms. Haspel to run clandestine operations, Senator Dianne Feinstein of California, then the senior Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, blocked the promotion over Ms. Haspels role in the interrogation program and the destruction of the tapes. On Thursday, critics of the C.I.A. questioned the choice of Ms. Haspel. Mr. Pompeo must explain to the American people how his promotion of someone allegedly involved in running a torture site squares with his own sworn promises to Congress that he will reject all forms of torture and abuse, said Christopher Anders, the deputy director of the American Civil Liberties Unions office in Washington. The conflicting views of Ms. Haspel were clear in the reactions to her promotion on Thursday from members of Congress. Democrats expressed concern about how she would approach the issue of torture, while Republicans were fulsome in their praise.

The list notably included prominent Obama administration officials, such as James R. Clapper Jr., the former director of national intelligence (very pleased), and Michael J. Morell, who twice served as the C.I.A.s acting director (I applaud the appointment). The praise for Ms. Haspel, despite her role in torturing detainees, reflects the agencys ambivalent attitude toward those who participated in the interrogation program. The Bush administration declared the methods legal, and the view within the C.I.A. was that those who used the techniques were doing their jobs. At the same time, many at the agency have little eagerness to see torture return. Where Ms. Haspel falls on the issue is not clear  as an undercover C.I.A. official, she was not offering public opinions on government policy  and neither she nor Mr. Pompeo could order agency personnel to resume the practice, because it is now against the law. Mr. Pompeos decision to elevate Ms. Haspel is also likely to be seen by the C.I.A.s rank-and-file as a vote of confidence in their work from their new director, despite Mr. Trumps dismissal of the intelligence community throughout his campaign and in the months between his election and inauguration. The open disdain with which Mr. Trump mocked the C.I.A., especially after intelligence agencies said they believed that Russia had tried to swing the election in his favor, had raised concerns at the agency of a repeat of the unhappy tenure of a former director, Porter J. Goss. Mr. Goss took over the C.I.A. in 2004, when the agency was widely viewed as being at odds with the Bush administration over the Iraq war, and his marching orders were to end what the White House viewed as a campaign of leaks by insiders who opposed administration policies. He lasted only 13 months after his attempt to crack down on leaks drove many veterans out of the C.I.A.   Editors Note: March 16, 2018   An earlier version of this article referred incorrectly to Gina Haspels role in the torture of detainees at a secret detention site in Thailand during her tenure there. While Ms. Haspel oversaw the site during the torture of Abd al-Rahim al-Nashiri at the site, she did not supervise the interrogation and waterboarding of the suspected Qaeda operative Abu Zubaydah. Following Ms. Haspels nomination this week to head the C.I.A., The Times published a profile of Ms. Haspel, detailing how career was shaped by her time running the prison and her willingness to take part in the agencys rendition, detention and interrogation program. During that reporting, a former senior C.I.A. official confirmed that Ms. Haspel arrived at the Thai detention site after Mr. Zubaydahs interrogation had concluded. The article has been revised to reflect the new information.  Correction: Feb. 4, 2017  An earlier version of this article included a quotation that referred incorrectly to Gina Haspel. She is not the first woman to serve as deputy director of the Central Intelligence Agency, as Representative Devin Nunes of California said. (Avril Haines was the first.)

The companys publication of a dossier with unverified allegations about Donald J. Trump, then the president-elect, ignited a debate over both the claims in the report and the outlets decision to publish it.   Credit Brendan Mcdermid/Reuters     A Russian technology executive who was named in a dossier containing unverified allegations about connections between President Trump and the Russian government has sued BuzzFeed News, which published the information. The defamation suit was filed in court on Friday in Broward County, Fla., according to lawyers for the executive, Aleksej Gubarev, the chief of XBT, a technology company based in Luxembourg. The suit focuses on allegations, made near the end of the dossier, that Mr. Gubarev and his company were involved in hacking operations against the leadership of the Democratic Party. In the complaint, Mr. Gubarevs lawyers say that BuzzFeed acted recklessly; that none of the statements have any basis in fact; and that Mr. Gubarevs association with the dossier has left his reputation in tatters, compromised his familys security and damaged his companys business prospects. It called BuzzFeeds decision perhaps one of the most reckless and irresponsible moments in modern journalism. The publishing of the dossier was one of the most startling moments of the weeks before Mr. Trumps inauguration.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   Compiled by a former British intelligence operative who was hired by Mr. Trumps Republican rivals and later by supporters of Hillary Clinton, the document had circulated for months among high-ranking government officials and journalists. The veracity of its claims had been investigated but never proved.  Continue reading the main story         Advertisement   Continue reading the main story       But after CNN reported last month that intelligence officials had presented a summary of the allegations to Mr. Trump and President Barack Obama, BuzzFeed decided to publish the document in full, saying that Americans can make up their own minds about allegations about the president-elect that have circulated at the highest levels of the U.S. government. When it published the dossier, BuzzFeed noted that it contained errors and that its claims had not been verified. The publications editor in chief, Ben Smith, later wrote that its reporters in the United States and Europe spent weeks investigating the report. BuzzFeed ignited a debate over both the claims in the report as well as the outlets decision to break from typical journalistic practices in publishing it. Mr. Trump denounced the unproven claims as a Nazi-esque smear , and called BuzzFeed a failing pile of garbage during a heated news conference on Jan. 11. Mr. Gubarevs lawsuit claims that while more than 30 publications tried to contact him after the dossiers publication, he was not contacted by BuzzFeed for his response to the allegations. Mr. Gubarev, 36, lives in Cyprus with his wife and three children. He founded the site Webzilla  which is also identified in the report, the complaint notes  and built it into an international business, XBT, with more than 300 employees around the world.

A federal lawsuit over the publishing of a sex tape featuring the wrestler Hulk Hogan that led the website Gawker to file for bankruptcy and eventually shut down was also filed in the state. That case, over invasion of privacy, remains a cautionary tale in the media world. After learning of the lawsuit on Friday, BuzzFeed removed the names of Mr. Gubarev and his company from the dossier. We have redacted Mr. Gubarevs name from the published dossier, and apologize for including it, the company said in an emailed statement to The New York Times. A spokesman for BuzzFeed said it had redacted other names in the document and should have redacted Mr. Gubarevs, but the spokesman defended the companys decision to publish the dossier.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   Mr. Gubarevs lawyers have also filed a lawsuit in Britain against the former intelligence agent who compiled the report and his consulting company. The lawsuit against BuzzFeed comes at a tense moment for the news media. Mr. Trumps administration has castigated journalists for challenging unverified or false claims presented by the White House as fact, and the presidents chief strategist, Stephen K. Bannon, has labeled the news media  the opposition party . Floyd Abrams, a First Amendment scholar and lawyer, said the lawsuit was a difficult situation for BuzzFeed to be confronted with. It seems inevitable that BuzzFeed will say in some fashion that subjecting it to crippling damages for publishing the dossier would, in the end, imperil the publics right to know just what misconduct an American president is suspected of, he said. He added that he could foresee lawyers arguing to move the case to federal court or to a court outside Florida. In the complaint, Mr. Gubarevs lawyers argue that he is not a public figure. But if the court disagrees, Mr. Gubarevs lawyers would have to prove that BuzzFeed acted not only negligently, but also maliciously. One potential argument for defense lawyers is a principle called neutral reportage, which defends the publishing of some defamatory material if it is a matter of public interest and does it in a fair and disinterested manner, without endorsing a defamatory charge, Mr. Abrams said. The principle has been rejected by some courts, however, and has not been tested widely, he added. I would think that wherever this case is heard, an absolutely central issue will be whether a court would adopt the neutral reportage principle and say basically precisely what the editor of BuzzFeed has been saying  that this is an enormous matter of public interest, we reported it fairly, we did not endorse it, we made very clear that these were simply charges that were well known to everyone but the American public, he said.

SCHMIDT FEB. 1, 2017     Continue reading the main story  Share This Page   Continue reading the main story           WASHINGTON  An internal Pentagon investigation found that senior officials at United States Central Command did not deliberately skew intelligence assessments about the war against the Islamic State, despite a widespread view among analysts within the command that reports were manipulated to present a distorted view of the military campaigns progress. The results of the investigation by the Defense Departments inspector general, released on Wednesday morning, largely exonerated the two men who led Central Commands intelligence analysis in 2014 and 2015, Maj. Gen. Steven Grove and his civilian deputy, Gregory Ryckman. Dozens of analysts at the command, known as Centcom, had anonymously accused the men of altering intelligence conclusions to paint a rosy picture of the campaigns military successes and the capability of Iraqi troops fighting Islamic State militants. The inspector generals investigation disputed those claims. We did not find that anyone intentionally attempted to distort intelligence, the report concluded. Nor did we find a systematic distortion of intelligence. At the same time, the 190-page report sketched a portrait of a sometimes dysfunctional intelligence headquarters at Centcom, the sprawling military command in Tampa, Fla., in charge of all American military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia. It also cited several examples of changes to intelligence reports that led many analysts to believe that their bosses were manipulating the conclusions.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   In one instance, when Iraqi forces dropped their weapons and retreated in the face of an Islamic State attack, the word flee was deleted and replaced with leave. Another intelligence report, the inspector general found, initially said that Iraqi troops had lost control of an Iraqi city. The final version of the report said that the troops had ceded the severely damaged city center and repositioned troops in nearby neighborhoods.  Continue reading the main story         Advertisement   Continue reading the main story       These few examples became known and widely discussed, and we believe they contributed to the belief that certain words were removed from products to distort the meaning, the report said. However, we did not uncover, nor did witnesses provide, any examples of editing that altered the facts being presented. The inspector generals investigation stemmed from complaints by a group of Centcom analysts, some with decades of experience working on Middle East issues, who believed that their reports were being manipulated. In September 2015, The New York Times identified Gregory Hooker , the top Iraq analyst at Centcom, as one of the leaders of the group. The complaints were taken seriously, partly because of Mr. Hookers credibility within the military intelligence community. Mr. Hooker has studied Iraq for two decades, and in 2005, he publicly criticized President George W. Bush s administration for pushing amateurish and unrealistic plans during the invasion of Iraq in 2003.

The chairmen of the committees issued a statement Wednesday saying the report confirms there were numerous problems within the Central Command. They cited a widespread perception that intelligence officials were distorting intelligence to present a more positive view of the success of Iraqi troops, giving an optimistic view of the fight against the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL. In August, the three panels released an interim report concluding that Centcom analysts were largely justified in their concerns that senior leaders at the command had manipulated the conclusions of intelligence reports. That report offered no evidence that analysis had been changed at the behest of Obama administration officials. The chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, Devin Nunes, Republican of California, said that he planned to bring the whistle-blowers before the committees to ask them about the reports findings. We are going to continue to do our work and give them the opportunity to come in and give us an assessment of whats in the report, Mr. Nunes said in a telephone interview.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   Representative Adam B. Schiff of California, the top Democrat on the committee, said in a statement on Wednesday that the fact that the whistle-blowers in this case had legitimate concerns, and even a perception of skewed intelligence, particularly among veteran analysts, is a problem that needs fixing. While noting that the new report spelled out weaknesses and flaws in Centcoms oversight of developing intelligence assessments, Mr. Schiff said there was no evidence that intelligence was falsified or that its leaders made any attempts to make the intelligence fit a political narrative. The Pentagon investigation, led by Glenn A. Fine, the acting Defense Department inspector general, also produced a 540-page classified report that was not released on Wednesday. The unclassified report cited statements from intelligence officials from other parts of the government who said that Centcom intelligence reports were often more positive than others. The top intelligence officer for the Joint Chiefs of Staff told investigators that he believed Centcom had a more positive assessment of the effects that were being achieved against ISIL than he did from reviewing the same sources. But the officer told investigators that it was not unusual to have different viewpoints of the same facts.

Sections of a draft order include a call to bring newly captured terrorism detainees there.   Credit Paul J. Richards/Agence France-Presse  Getty Images     WASHINGTON  The Trump White House appears to have backed off for now on its consideration of reopening overseas black site prisons, where the C.I.A. once tortured terrorism suspects, after a leaked draft executive order prompted bipartisan pushback from Congress and cabinet officials. On Thursday, the White House circulated among National Security Council staff members a revised version of the draft order on detainees that deleted language contemplating a revival of the C.I.A. prisons, according to several officials familiar with its contents. The draft order retains other parts of the original that focus on making greater use of the militarys Guantanamo Bay prison, which the Obama administration had tried to close. Those sections, reflecting repeated vows from President Trump, include a call to bring newly captured terrorism detainees there and to freeze plans for any more transfers. After news outlets reported details of the original draft on Jan. 25, lawmakers erupted in outrage, and both the defense secretary, Jim Mattis, and the C.I.A. director, Mike Pompeo, disavowed any prior knowledge of the contemplated order.

Continue reading the main story         Advertisement   Continue reading the main story       It sounds like a smart reaction to the reaction to the leaked draft, she said. Transparency is a good corrective to overreach, and it provides the opportunity for more careful consideration of the broader implications of an order like this. In addition to the change on C.I.A. prisons, the revised draft, unlike the original, would not revive a 2007 executive order issued by President George W. Bush, and later rescinded by President Barack Obama, that laid out a limited understanding of which torture techniques count as war crimes under the Geneva Conventions. Such a move would reduce the legal risk to interrogators who employ harsh tactics not on that list, like prolonged sleep deprivation. The revised draft would also not revoke two executive orders governing detainees that Mr. Obama issued in January 2009, as the original would have. The first bars the C.I.A. from operating prisons and requires all interrogators to adhere to techniques approved in the Army Field Manual. The other was Mr. Obamas ill-fated directive to close the Guantanamo prison within a year. However, the revised draft is said to have a provision asserting that all contradictory sections of previous orders are revoked, which would implicitly repeal the part of Mr. Obamas Guantanamo order that declared an intention to close the prison by the long-missed deadline.

The official said the draft had been held much more closely than the original one had been, apparently to prevent further leaks. The White House had distributed its original draft executive order on detainees in an email to council staff members at 8:41 a.m. on Jan. 24, giving them until 10 that morning to provide any comment. It was one of at least five significant draft orders distributed to them at the same time and with the same quick deadline, two of which Mr. Trump signed in the next few days. The staff members urged the White House to slow down and get input from affected agencies and departments. They forwarded the email with the draft executive order on detainees to other officials in the government, who provided it to still other people, until it was leaked. The text of the original draft was first reported by The New York Times on Jan. 25. In response to the news reports, the White House press secretary, Sean Spicer, falsely said that the draft was not a White House document. After The Times then reported details about when and how the White House had circulated it, Mr. Spicer said that it had not been derived from White House sources and suggested that its origins traced to input provided to the Trump transition effort.

But the language in the Trump White House version had been revised, including to take account of subsequent legal and geopolitical developments and to substitute terms like fight against radical Islamism for global war on terrorism. By Jan. 27, Mr. Trump foreshadowed that his flirtation with reviving a C.I.A. interrogation program had come to an end, at least for the time being. At a news conference, Mr. Trump said that while he personally supported waterboarding and thought torture worked, Mr. Mattis, who opposes torture, will override because Im giving him that power.

Credit Chris Wattie/Agence France-Presse  Getty Images     Last May when forest fires ravaged Fort McMurray, Alberta, I visited the Al Rashid Mosque in Edmonton. Among the 100 or so evacuee families it helped and sheltered were two families with members who had recently reached Fort McMurray as refugees from the turmoil in Syria. The efforts of the members of the mosque didnt stop there. They rapidly tapped their business contacts and sent several tractor-trailer loads of clothing and supplies to other evacuation sites. But what I most remember is that in the midst of all that frenzied activity, I was received graciously and warmly by everyone I met at the mosque. Memories of that reception came back to me on Sunday night as word began to trickle in about the shooting at the Islamic Cultural Center of Quebec in the Ste.-Foy neighborhood of Quebec City. As is usually the case with such stories, initial reports were confused and often inaccurate. A man of Moroccan descent who went in to help the wounded was arrested, leading to suggestions by the police that there were two killers. In the end, six people were dead and eight wounded, some critically. Most of them were shot in the back while praying. It appeared to be the work of a single gunman, Alexandre Bissonnette, according to the police. He now faces six counts of first degree murder. The police may also bring terrorism charges.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   On Thursday and Friday, funerals for the victims were held before large crowds in Montreal and then Quebec. Both services were attended by several politicians, including Prime Minister Justin Trudeau.  Continue reading the main story         Advertisement   Continue reading the main story       Our children will continue to be honorable citizens in this country, as you were, Imam Hussein Guillet said in Quebecs large convention center on Friday. We have chosen this society, and we ask that this society choose us and welcome us. The tragedy struck just as Quebecs famous winter carnival was getting underway. That lead to the incongruous sight of the citys shellshocked Muslim leadership and several equally stunned politicians passing by statues of Bonhomme, the carnivals grinning and overweight snowman mascot, as they entered City Hall on Monday for a news conference. Windows in the room which hosted it were decorated with carnival vuvuzelas. Some of that shock, as Craig Smith and I reported, came from a concern that the tragedy may have been a product of a growing intolerance toward Muslims and extremism that has taken root in parts of Quebec. Philippe Couillard, the premier of Quebec, in eloquent remarks, acknowledged Quebecs demons and urged everyone to work together to eliminate them. He also noted the real test will come in a few weeks when the reflex to express sympathy and solidarity with Muslim members of the community will have faded. Mr. Smith and Dan Levin also looked broadly at right-wing extremism in Canada . While moderate by the standards of the United States, they found that there has been a flurry of right-wing groups developing in the country. The Quebec City attack, they wrote, has put many on guard that Canadas embrace of Muslim immigration is raising tensions. In Opinion, Haroon Siddiqui, who many Canadians may know from his time as a columnist and editor at the Toronto Star, wrote that the attack was the culmination of years of growing suspicion and bigotry. An incurably optimistic Canadian, I long believed that Canada would be immune to anti-Muslim hysteria, he wrote I was mistaken. This attack has been a long time coming.

During the news conference, the mosques leaders  who were patient and generous with journalists in the room  asked that the members who died be remembered as people, not statistics. I provided a glimpse of who they were. New Neighbor When President Donald J. Trump signed an executive order restricting immigration and creating chaos worldwide, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau took to Twitter. But it was not to criticize the American president. Instead Mr. Trudeau used the occasion to assure refugees that they are welcome in Canada regardless of your faith.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   I also looked this week at how Mr. Trudeau and his government are handling a new American administration which is the opposite of almost everything they stand for and which has proposed measures that could severely harm Canadas economy. Two things stood out. Mr. Trudeau is not going to pick needless fights with Mr. Trump, despite calls from Canadians for him to adopt the role of the presidents international opponent. And Canada is rounding up every friend and ally in the United States it can find. New Colleague Mr. Smith, Mr. Levin and I, supplemented by various colleagues from the United States, have been responsible for most of The New York Times reporting on Canada.

Back Story  Photo         Credit Damon Winter/The New York Times    Last week, the actor Peter Capaldi made headlines when he announced he would be leaving his starring role on Doctor Who, the long-running British television series about a time-traveling alien. The Doctor  who isnt referred to as Doctor Who  is a Time Lord from a distant planet who explores the universe in a time machine called the Tardis (which stands for Time and Relative Dimension in Space). A plucky human companion usually accompanies the Doctor, who faces a rotating cast of alien adversaries. Originally conceived as a family-friendly educational program, the series began in 1963 and, with the exception of a 16-year gap (1989-2005), has been broadcast ever since. The show is a national institution in Britain and a cult favorite elsewhere in the world, with more than 800 episodes ( a Guinness world record ). The Doctor is capable of regenerating, a concept that was introduced to prolong the series when its first lead actor, William Hartnell, left amid failing health. Mr. Capaldi, above, is the 12th actor  and the 12th white man  to fill the role. Fans have urged the producers to address the lack of diversity when the 13th Doctor makes his  or her  debut.

Our state is home to several reputable groundhogs (also called whistle pigs or woodchucks)  including Holtsville Hal, Malverne Mel and Dunkirk Dave  but first and foremost is the revered Staten Island Chuck.

The 4-year-old, 8.5-pound animal, which Ms. Orens described as a curvy lady right now, feeds on nutritious rodent pellets, roughage like kale, and sweet potatoes. Perhaps they serve something similar at your local lunch spot. And the groundhog is quite the social butterfly. In preparation for today, Ms. Chuck spent months training and socializing with zoo caretakers to ensure an elegant public appearance (free of any spats with the mayor , who skipped the event this year) and a confident, correct, shadow-or-no-shadow verdict.

Credit Amy Lombard for The New York Times    While Ms. Chuck didnt do much public speaking this morning, she does know how to high-five, Ms. Orens said. Which is really cute, but is also really good as a medical move because you can then clip her nails. (She does not, however, take baths or get her teeth cleaned.) Heres what else is happening: Weather              Shadow or not, city marmots will see relatively cheerful skies outside their burrows. The sun is creeping out from behind the clouds and should tug the mercury up to a high of 43 . (Although wind gusts this afternoon could make it feel colder.)

While groundhogs certainly have their charm, today could have belonged to a much cuter animal. The prairie dog. Zoos, animal welfare activists and organizations including the Humane Society of the United States have, in the past, campaigned for Feb. 2 to be Prairie Dog Day , instead of a gimmick for groundhogs. Staten Island Chuck, part of the rodentia order of mammals, is a relative not only of rats, mice and squirrels, but also of prairie dogs. Prairie Dog Day would have raised awareness about this slowly fading animal, which serves a different role from Chuck and his contemporaries: While, according to legend, groundhogs can predict the length of winter, prairie dogs can actually help determine the health of our countrys plains.

But hours later, Defense Department officials acknowledged that the videos appeared to be 10 years old, similar to training messages by Al Qaeda that were distributed on the internet in 2007. The discovery prompted Central Command to cancel a planned news conference trumpeting the intelligence gathered in the Yemen raid. Pentagon officials still insisted that the videos vintage did not detract from the importance of the intelligence gathered during the raid on Sunday, during which a member of the Navy SEALs and 14 militants were killed. Pentagon officials say they now believe that a number of civilians, including children, were also killed in the raid, which was the first one ordered by President Trump since he took the oath of office.
