The change in Teslas and Fords stock price.         DETROIT  The record pace of auto sales in the United States is slowing down, leaving investors increasingly bearish on auto stocks. But there is one exception. Tesla , the electric-vehicle upstart, continues to surge. On Monday, Tesla surpassed Ford Motor in market value for the first time and moved within striking distance of General Motors, starkly illustrating the growing gap in investors optimism over its future versus the prospects for the traditional carmakers from Detroit. While G.M. and Ford may have strong profits and healthy balance sheets, Tesla offers something Wall Street loves much more: the potential for dramatic growth. Investors want something that is going to go up in orders of magnitude in six months to six years, and Tesla is that story, said Karl Brauer, a senior editor at Kelley Blue Book. Nobody thinks Ford or G.M. is going to do that.

Instead, he promotes his California-based company as a dynamic vehicle for growth, despite the risks and challenges ahead of it.  Continue reading the main story         Advertisement   Continue reading the main story       In his vision, Tesla is going to change the world, and is primed to cash in on the two transformative trends in the industry: the shift to electric vehicles as part of a broader societal move to cleaner energy, and the advent of automated driving. Tesla is very vocal in talking about how they are positioned as we move from humans driving cars powered by gasoline to computers driving cars powered by batteries, Mr. Brauer said. At the end of Mondays trading, Tesla reached a market capitalization of $48.7 billion compared with Fords $45.6 billion, according to Bloomberg. General Motors was at $51.2 billion. Teslas market milestone came at the intersection of two countervailing trends. On Sunday, Tesla said its first-quarter sales were up 69 percent from the same period a year ago. On Monday, monthly sales figures for the conventional automakers showed them struggling to meet last Marchs performance.  Photo        Ford Motors truck plant in Louisville, Ky. Fords sales fell sharply in March, and its stock price was down 1.7 percent on Monday.   Credit Luke Sharrett/Bloomberg    That sent stocks in the Detroit automakers down for the day  G.M. was off 3.4 percent and Ford 1.7 percent  while Teslas stock soared by more than 7 percent. Despite the recent boom years for the American motor industry, in which G.M. and Ford have been the biggest beneficiaries, executives are working overtime just to convince Wall Street that their business model can produce incremental improvements. Mr. Brauer said that reception was unfortunate for G.M. and Ford because the reality is, theyre as financially healthy as theyve ever been, and theyre in very good position for the future.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   Both companies have rebounded steadily since the recession, although G.M. needed a bankruptcy filing and $49 billion government bailout to recover. And both have taken advantage of the pent-up consumer demand for new vehicles in recent years, especially for pickup trucks and sport utility vehicles. But neither automaker has convinced Wall Street that it has shed its boom-or-bust reputation tied to broader economic cycles, or is at the forefront of new technology being developed for self-driving vehicles and electric cars. The Detroit automakers are hardly sitting still in their efforts to improve current results and future prospects. G.M. made the momentous decision recently to sell its money-losing European division, and Ford is adding jobs to accelerate its shift toward electric and autonomous vehicles. Both automakers have bought technology companies to bolster their in-house engineering expertise, and their executives have embraced the chance to work with the Trump administration on scaling back government regulations.

Last week, one of G.M.s large investors, the hedge fund Greenlight Capital, proposed the creation of two classes of stock  one that strictly pays dividends, and a second tied directly to earnings and future growth in areas like self-driving cars and ride-hailing services. G.M. directors flatly rejected the idea as too risky, and the chief executive, Mary Barra, said there was no need to deviate from executing a plan that is delivering record financial and operation results. Yet while industry analysts generally supported the decision, G.M.s share price barely budged on the news that it was staying the course.

Credit Melissa Vaeth for General Motors    And Mondays data, showing total industry sales off 1.6 percent, underscored that overall demand for new vehicles is slipping despite a bevy of discounts and incentives. G.M. showed a slight gain from the prior March, while Ford sales fell sharply. Several other automakers, such as Toyota, Fiat Chrysler and Hyundai, also reported declines. Of course, based on the number of cars actually being made, they are in a different league from Tesla. G.M. sold 256,000 vehicles in the United States last month, and Ford 234,000. Teslas sales for the same period: 4,000. But it was the growth and the outlook, not the raw numbers, that moved the markets. Investors tend to look at Tesla as a technology start-up rather than an automaker.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   Its almost like Tesla is positioned in peoples minds as an energy storage company that happens to put most of its batteries on wheels, said Andrew Stewart, chief investment officer at Exchange Capital Management, an investment firm in Ann Arbor, Mich. Tesla is also prone to more volatile stock movements because Mr. Musk and other board members and top executives own a large chunk of shares, leaving a relative few that change hands frequently, he said. Whenever theres interesting news, the people trying to buy are buying from a limited number of people who are willing to sell, Mr. Stewart said. While you have Ford and G.M., and theyre these decades-old, more-institutional industrial companies. Because of Teslas acclaim and the limited number of shares being traded, the company draws more individual investors, and its share price tends to spike whenever Tesla or Mr. Musk makes news. This weeks jump in its stock price was set off by a brief news release on Sunday that said Tesla had delivered more than 25,000 cars in the first quarter, exceeding analysts estimates. While Tesla may enjoy the favor of investors, it still faces some daunting hurdles to reach its goals. This summer, the company is supposed to start making the Model 3, a compact electric model that Tesla plans to sell for $35,000 and produce in significantly higher volumes. It currently offers two vehicles, the Model S luxury sedan and the Model X S.U.V., both of which sell for $90,000 or more when options are added in. (People who buy its cars benefit from a $7,500 federal tax credit on environmentally friendly cars, a selling point with an uncertain future.) Once Tesla begins producing the Model 3, Mr. Musk expects production to ramp up quickly, with a goal of making 500,000 cars a year by 2018. Achieving that target will not be easy, Mr. Brauer said. Thats five times growth in volume, he said. I dont know of any car company thats ever done that in a two-year period.   Bill Vlasic reported from Detroit, and Neal E. Boudette from Ann Arbor, Mich.

But Mr. Aldred and his team kept running into roadblocks. Their first attempt, unveiled in 2001 , was too clunky for James Dyson, the companys founder. The next prototype involved creating a computer vision system that would allow the machine to skirt independently around furniture; it took more than a decade to perfect. As smartphones became everyday tools, Dysons robotics team again had to rethink the vacuum cleaner, adding internet connectivity so the machine could send notifications  with a heat map of where it had cleaned  to a mobile device. After a nearly 20-year odyssey, the robot cleaner, priced at an eye-watering $1,000, finally hit stores worldwide last year. At times, I really asked myself what I had signed up for, Mr. Aldred said in an interview at Dysons rural headquarters near the border with Wales. But James Dyson always told us to focus on the product. Everything else would follow.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   Not many consumer electronics brands would spend almost two decades  and tens of millions of dollars  building a vacuum cleaner that retails for more than a top-of-the-line laptop.  Continue reading the main story         Advertisement   Continue reading the main story       But combining an almost obsessive eye for design and engineering, the privately held Dyson has cornered the nonglamorous market of high-end vacuum cleaners, lights and hair dryers  and in the process bucked the technology truism that companies rarely make money in the difficult arena of hardware.

Credit Lauren Fleishman for The New York Times    Even as other hardware brands like Samsung, the smartwatch maker Fitbit and the camera designer GoPro have struggled with physical products because of low-priced copycats and thin profit margins, Dyson has shown an uncanny ability to mint money. Its latest robot cleaner, which is selling briskly, exemplifies that and puts Dyson in rarefied company alongside Apple as one of the few tech companies worldwide to consistently profit from consumer gadgets. It is extremely difficult to make money if youre not in the premium segment of the market, said Tim Bajarin, president of Creative Strategies, a tech consulting firm. Thats what Apple and Dyson have done well  being best in breed for technology and industrial design. Dyson said its pretax profits rose 41 percent last year to 631 million pounds, or $785 million, while revenue rose 45 percent to 2.5 billion, or $3.1 billion, partly because of the weakened British pound. Mr. Dyson, 69, who founded the company in 1992, is worth about 5 billion, or $6.2 billion. The company, with 8,500 employees split mostly between Britain and a factory in Malaysia, is growing rapidly in China, where the countrys emerging middle class remains eager to spend on designer goods, including expensive vacuum cleaners. Asia is a huge growth area for us, said Max Conze, Dysons chief executive, who joined from Procter & Gamble in 2010. Five years ago, 85 percent of what we sold was corded vacuum cleaners. Now, more than 80 percent comes from new products. Dyson is indeed moving beyond vacuum cleaners, hair dryers and air purifiers. The company said it would spend more than $2 billion on battery technology, machine learning and other high-tech wizardry to create new products, many of which remain under wraps behind tight security at its headquarters.

The developments may include an electric car. Dyson bought an American battery start-up in 2015, secured a hefty British government grant last year to develop the vehicle concept and hired executives from Tesla and Aston Martin. Dyson officials deny that they are making an electric car.

Were not afraid to try and beat them. As with any company synonymous with James Dyson, its often hard to separate Dyson the man from Dyson the brand. Tall, bookish and with a penchant for designer glasses, Mr. Dyson trained as an industrial engineer and dabbled in building things like boats and wheelbarrows before settling on vacuum cleaners by the late 1970s. Frustrated with how his existing machine worked, Mr. Dyson reused technology that mirrored how a cyclone forcefully sucked wind from its surroundings, eventually spending 15 years  and building more than 5,000 prototypes  before releasing his first vacuum cleaner in 1993. He initially licensed the designs to companies in the United States and Japan, but eventually decided to build the machines himself. When we launched it, we were slightly terrified, said Mr. Dyson, who had mortgaged his home and used his life savings to fund the project. Im not a businessman. I didnt start a business, I started with an idea.  Photo        Sir James Dyson, who founded the company in 1992, is worth about 5 billion, or $6.2 billion.   Credit Lauren Fleishman for The New York Times    His professorial look, complete with cut-glass English accent, belies Mr. Dysons ruthlessness. When competitors like Hoover and Samsung copied his ideas after his vacuum cleaner hit the market, the entrepreneur fought, and won, costly patent lawsuits, and instilled an us versus them attitude that still permeates the company. At Dysons headquarters  chosen for its proximity to Mr. Dysons original workshop  employees remain tight-lipped, even among themselves, about their projects. During a tour of the companys facilities, prototypes were covered in tarps while large areas of the open-plan offices were off limits. Photographs of engineers computer screens were prohibited, and machinery in some of the research labs was obscured with black trash bags.

In 2000, the company released a washing machine priced at 1,000, or double the cost of rival products. Despite positive reviews, Dyson pulled the plug five years later after failing to turn the machine into a profitable business. Now, the original washing machine prototype stands unloved in a corridor in one of Dysons research buildings. At many publicly listed companies, such a failure might have cost people their jobs. But at Dyson, where 14.5 percent of annual revenue is earmarked for research and development, engineers took the mistake in stride and began diversifying into other products. For Steve Courtney, head of Dysons new products unit, that included moving into cordless vacuum cleaners in 2005, even though analysts said the machines would hurt sales of the companys corded products. It also meant releasing bladeless fans four years later that borrowed heavily from Dysons existing vacuum technology  the product range was later extended to internet-connected air purifiers.  Photo        Advanced design engineer Laura Howard in the hair science research lab at Dysons headquarters.   Credit Lauren Fleishman for The New York Times    And when the company began selling $400 hair dryers last year, its mostly male engineering team not only learned to professionally blow-dry hair to understand how rival products worked, but also again copied the battery, motor and fan technology from Dysons existing products. We may go through a lot of pain and it may take a lot of time, but then we can transfer what we develop into something completely new, Mr. Courtney said. We need big new areas, new markets. Dysons ambitions have raised some eyebrows, particularly after it bought Sakti3, a Michigan start-up specializing in so-called solid state batteries, for $90 million in 2015. This technology could be more than three times as powerful  and significantly safer  than batteries used now in smartphones and electric cars. Mr. Dyson later claimed his company would invest more than $1 billion by 2020 to figure out how to mass-produce these solid-state batteries, although experts question whether Sakti3s technology will ever go beyond the lab. The community was surprised by the investment, said Eric Wachsman, director of the energy research center at the University of Maryland, who is developing a rival project. No one knows if their technology will work or not.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   Mark Taylor, Dysons research director, said the company was committed to making the battery technology work. None of this is stopping Dysons long-term planning. At the modernist campus of Imperial College London, Andrew Davison, a computer vision expert, has worked with Dyson on a  5 million research project aimed at helping robots better interact with the world around them. (Dyson separately sponsors a Design Engineering School at the British college.) Mr. Davison, an Imperial College professor, already helped Dyson build the computer vision used in its robotic cleaner. His team is now combining that technology with machine learning and artificial intelligence so that one day, the companys products may navigate the real world, just as its autonomous vacuum cleaner now scuttles around peoples houses. Were looking really far out, Mr. Davison said. Most of the work that we do is years away from being in an actual product.   Follow Mark Scott on Twitter @markscott82 .

The company said it delivered more than 25,000 cars and sport utility vehicles in the first quarter, a rise of about 69 percent from the same period a year ago. The increase from the fourth quarter was smaller, however. In the final quarter of 2016, Tesla delivered 22,252 cars and S.U.V.s. The first-quarter total is a preliminary figure that could change when the company reports its first-quarter earnings next month. Tesla also said it produced a record 25,418 vehicles in the quarter, up from 15,510 a year ago, although again the rise was much smaller when compared with the fourth quarter, when it built 24,882 cars. The company currently offers the Model S luxury sedan and the Model X S.U.V. , both of which can sell for $90,000 or more once options are included. In July, it plans to begin production of the Model 3  a compact car the company hopes to sell for $35,000 and produce in significantly higher volume.

At that rate, Tesla would need to average production of more than 40,000 cars a month, more than it now produces in a quarter.

Such a rapid expansion would tax even long-established automakers, and Tesla is moving forward with the Model 3 while taking on other challenges.

What clients dont want to pay for is any routine work. Credit Jason Henry for The New York Times April 3, 2017 To the Editor: Re  I, Robot, Esq.? Not Just Yet  (Business Day, March 20): It shouldnt come as a surprise that the unrelenting march of technology  specifically, artificial intelligence, or A.I.  would eventually affect the legal market and other white-collar professions. But what is different now from, say, the introduction of automobiles at the expense of horse-driven cabs is the sheer magnitude of all those affected by A.I. Consider the millions of transportation-related jobs that will be disrupted by the rapidly approaching introduction of self-driving cars and trucks. There arent too many options. While some have proposed a stopgap method of taxing employers who replace human workers with robots, better solutions include providing training and re-education for those who can move on to other jobs, and a universal basic income for those who cant. For the lawyers in particular, incoming law students must demand that their education provide them with the tools to adapt before they end up with hundreds of thousands of dollars in student debt and a disappearing profession.

Credit Julian Stratenschulte/European Pressphoto Agency     Ferdinand Piech, a former chief executive of Volkswagen who was a dominant presence at the carmaker for more than two decades, has agreed to sell most of his 15 percent stake in the family holding company to his relatives rather than to an outside investor. The stake was valued at more than $1 billion. The deal, announced on Monday, averts the turmoil that might have ensued if the Porsche and the Piech families had been forced to absorb an outside shareholder into Porsche Automobil Holding, which owns 52 percent of Volkswagens voting shares. Volkswagen also has preferred shares that entitle their owners to dividends but do not include voting rights. But critics of the way the family has overseen Volkswagen may see the deal as a missed opportunity to bring in new viewpoints and shake up the carmakers insular company culture. The indirect stake in Volkswagen would have been attractive to Chinese investors, among others. The transfer underlines the commitment of the Porsche and Piech families as co-owners of Porsche Automobil Holding SE and Volkswagen, the holding company said in a statement.

Continue reading the main story         Advertisement   Continue reading the main story       At the same time, Mr. Piechs dictatorial management style is often seen as a contributing factor in the emissions cheating scandal that has embroiled the company since late 2015. Mr. Piech has not been directly implicated in the scandal, but he was known for dismissing or sidelining executives who did not meet his high expectations, possibly motivating some of them to resort to deception when they discovered in 2006 that Volkswagen diesel cars could not legally meet American emissions standards. The scandal has cost Volkswagen tens of billions of dollars in legal settlements and fines and focused attention on the controlling families, all of whom are descendants of Ferdinand Porsche, who designed the Volkswagen Beetle for Adolf Hitler. The Piech and the Porsche families have been reluctant to appoint outsiders to positions in top management at Volkswagen, opening the company to criticism that it remains dominated by people who were in positions of power as the wrongdoing was unfolding.     Engineering a Deception: What Led to Volkswagens Diesel Scandal  In September 2015, Volkswagen was accused of evading emissions standards in the U.S. The scandal has hit the company hard.             The management of the holding company and Volkswagen are closely intertwined. Hans Dieter Potsch, chairman of the Volkswagen supervisory board, is also chairman of the Porsche Holding management board. Matthias Muller, the chief executive of Volkswagen, is a member of the Porsche Holding management board. Another member of the holding companys board is Manfred Doss, Volkswagens chief counsel and the person who has overseen efforts to contain the myriad legal challenges that arose from the scandal. Mr. Piech will retain a small stake in Porsche Holding, but he is unlikely to play an active role in Volkswagen, a company that sometimes seemed to be practically created in his image. Mr. Piech will remain a member of the Porsche Holding supervisory board at least until the transfer of shares is complete, the company said. It did not say how much the other members of the family were paying for his shares.  Newsletter Sign Up  Continue reading the main story        Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

He became chief executive of Volkswagen in 1993 and led the company from the brink of bankruptcy to dominance of the European car market and near parity with Toyota, which competes with Volkswagen for the title of worlds largest automaker. Mr. Piech was also a force in the development of diesel for passenger cars. Diesel engines offered better fuel economy than gasoline motors but also produced more nitrogen oxide emissions, a major component of smog. As emissions standards became more stringent, Volkswagen engineers struggled to build compliant engines.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   In 2006, according to admissions the company has made in court, Volkswagen decided to install software in cars sold in the United States that could sense when official tests were underway and temporarily activate equipment to control emissions. The equipment was not capable of meeting pollution standards during regular driving. The authoritarian, unforgiving company culture that Mr. Piech created is seen as one of the elements that led Volkswagen employees to cheat. Mr. Piech became the chairman of Volkswagens supervisory board in 2002 after retiring as chief executive, but he was forced out in 2015, a few months before the emissions cheating became public. A grandson of Ferdinand Porsche, Mr. Piech has had tense relations with other members of the family for decades, and his departure could make it easier to achieve harmony and pave the way for a younger generation to assume more influence. The sale of Mr. Piechs share is likely to provoke speculation that he might invest the money in some other way in order to retain influence in the industry to which he has devoted his life. Mr. Piech has given no public indication of what he might do with the money.

And there was a time when Microsoft looked like the tech company that could never be beaten. Today, a handful of companies have that sort of iron grip on the industry, but perhaps none quite so much as Google  the ad-driven heart of the Alphabet conglomerate. Self-driving cars may be the future, and bioscience sure is interesting, but its the ads that pay the bills. Now, even as Google enjoys historic success, a run of bad news has exposed a vulnerability in its automated advertising system. In recent weeks, big advertisers have become increasingly concerned that their brands have been appearing alongside YouTube videos posted by extremists and other unwelcome material.

The companys biggest plant in the world is in South Carolina.   Credit Travis Dove for The New York Times     FRANKFURT  When Angela Merkel, Germany s chancellor, met with President Trump in Washington, she brought three executives with her, all heads of German manufacturing or engineering giants. Their message? Germany is not a threat to the United States. For decades, the United States has been a kind of second home to German carmakers, a place not only to sell vehicles but also to build them. German manufacturers employ thousands at plants across the United States, and produce finished products like cars, as well as parts and machinery, within the country for sale domestically or export abroad. But that the point  made during a session that included the chief executives of BMW, the carmaker; Siemens, the electronics and engineering company; and Schaeffler, a major supplier of parts for automotive engines, transmissions and chassis  needed to be made at all underlines growing concern in Berlin over hostility directed at German industry by the Trump administration. Peter Navarro, an economic adviser to Mr. Trump, has accused Germany of being a currency manipulator, even though German politicians and economists are among the staunchest critics of European Central Bank policies that have encouraged a weak euro. And the American president himself wondered aloud to a German newspaper in January why Americans buy lots of Mercedes cars while Germans hardly buy any Chevrolets.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   The anger from the Trump administration has been a rude shock, threatening the bedrock of Germanys economy and leaving executives perplexed. Their quandary is one faced by business across Europe: Mr. Trump has questioned the assumptions that have underpinned trans-Atlantic commerce since the end of World War II, without making clear what could come instead.  Continue reading the main story         Advertisement   Continue reading the main story       I think there is a little bit lack of understanding, Harald Kruger, the chief executive of BMW, said in an interview at the Geneva International Motor Show in March, not long after Mr. Trump had attacked the company for building a plant in Mexico. Maybe there hasnt been enough data supplied before. But delivering a counterargument to the administrations protectionist rhetoric  pointing out, for example, that BMWs largest factory in the world is in a South Carolina county that voted heavily for Mr. Trump  has proved exceptionally difficult. Mr. Trumps election disrupted old lines of communication and left BMW and other companies with no idea whom to talk to in Washington. For now, businesses hope that Mr. Trump is not really serious about erecting trade barriers with Europe, which would arguably damage the United States economy as well. They hope that, over time, they can find ways to sway him.

Among them were, in front row seated, Joe Kaeser, chief of Siemens, left; and Harald Kruger, chief of BMW.   Credit Clemens Bilan/European Pressphoto Agency    If the Trump administration does follow through, however, the consequences will be particularly ominous for Germany. The United States is Germanys biggest customer. American consumers and businesses bought machine tools, construction equipment and other goods from Germany worth 107 billion euros , or $115.5 billion, last year, according to Germanys Federal Statistical Office. By comparison, Germany bought only 58 billion in goods from the United States, an imbalance that members of the Trump administration have vowed to correct. The March 17 visit to Washington, led by Ms. Merkel, provided a measure of how seriously Berlin views the threat. It was a good discussion, Mr. Kruger said a few days later at a news conference in Munich. We were able to talk about how much German carmakers have invested and how many jobs we have created.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   The session with the president included a round-table meeting where Mr. Kruger and the other business leaders, Joe Kaeser of Siemens and Klaus Rosenfeld of Schaeffler, gave a presentation on the countrys vocational education system for young people. The issue of free trade came up, the BMW chief said, but he did not elaborate except to say that it was essential that the carmaker be able to export products from the United States. German companies fear that Trump policies could ignite a trade war and interfere with exports.

Whether that message got through, however, is unclear. Germany and the United States, traditionally close allies, are still groping to find common ground following President Trumps election. Those differences were on display at a meeting of finance ministers and central bank presidents from the Group of 20 in Baden-Baden, Germany, that began on the same day that Ms. Merkel visited Mr. Trump. The American delegation, led by Steven Mnuchin, the Treasury secretary, refused to endorse language from a joint statement last year that condemned protectionism and endorsed free trade. The stance taken by the United States, the linchpin of global commerce, upset a longstanding consensus and sent shudders through the rest of the world.

Credit Travis Dove for The New York Times    But even before Mr. Trumps election, it was a gloomy period for advocates of trans-Atlantic trade. After more than three years of painstaking negotiations, an ambitious effort to dismantle trade barriers between the European Union and United States stalled amid opposition from, of all places, Germany. Surprisingly, strong majorities in the United States and Germany support trade between the two countries in principle, according to a survey by YouGov for the Bertelsmann Foundation, a German research group. That suggests that there is space for businesses to promote their view that free trade is not the job killer that Mr. Trump and populist leaders in Europe make it out to be. The question European business is still wrestling with is how to do so. BMW has long been one of the most sophisticated political operators in the United States. The company, based in Munich, has government relations offices in South Carolina, site of its largest factory in the world; Washington; and Sacramento. California is important to the car company because the state sets emissions standards that are emulated by numerous other states. And BMW is not without political clout. It employs 9,000 people in Spartanburg, S.C., in a county that voted for Mr. Trump by a large margin. At least four times that many work for suppliers. Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina is a fierce defender of the companys interests, and one of Mr. Trumps most vocal Republican critics.

Many of those BMWs went to China. The company has in fact created the kind of manufacturing jobs that Mr. Trump says he wants. It is not alone. Many German companies have large factories in the United States, including Mercedes in Tuscaloosa, Ala., and Volkswagen in Chattanooga, Tenn., where the company recently began making a new S.U.V., the Atlas, which will go on sale in May. Siemens says it has about 60 plants in the United States turning out products like wind turbines and light rail vehicles. It employs 50,000 people in the country. And while the rhetoric in the United States has turned distinctively against foreign trade, American politicians have not shown any aversion to it when it brings jobs to their districts. That includes some people close to the president. For example, as governor of South Carolina, Nikki R. Haley was known as a friend to BMW and lobbied heavily for Volvo Cars to choose the state as a site for a new factory that will have an annual capacity of 100,000 cars. That was despite Volvos being owned by Geely Automobile Holdings, which is based in China, a prime target of Mr. Trumps rhetoric. Volvo broke ground for the factory in Berkeley County, S.C., in September 2015. Ms. Haley now has a new job. She is Mr. Trumps ambassador to the United Nations.

He became a soldier at age 9.   Credit Tyler Hicks/The New York Times     Times Insider delivers behind-the-scenes insights into how news, features and opinion come together at The New York Times. In this article, Jeffrey Gettleman, The Timess East Africa bureau chief of more than a decade, explains the delicate dance involved in reporting a story about a severely traumatized boy in a land of scars. Theres probably no more heart-wrenching symbol of war than a child soldier. That little boy, standing on the side of the road and constantly shifting his heavy AK-47 from shoulder to shoulder, represents a society that has imploded. He is the offspring of state failure and intense conflict; the destruction of schools; the manipulation of families; the exploitation of desperate need.           Thousands of children are fighting on front lines across the world, but there may be no area where the problem is as pernicious as the beat I cover, Eastern and Central Africa. In Somalia , for instance, child soldiers once ran a checkpoint by the international airport, searching cars (they could barely see over the hood). And in the Democratic Republic of Congo and the Central African Republic , countless children serve in the militias. Most of these armed groups dont have an ideology, so the only people willing to fight for them are gullible children  many of whom have been drugged or kidnapped. Although finding them isnt difficult, child soldiers often slink away when asked questions. Most of their commanders know full well that what they are doing is illegal  using fighters under the age of 15 is considered a war crime. Its a delicate dance, trying to get information. You ask a few questions, jot down some quick notes and move on. Its not a good idea to aggravate a moody, heavily armed 12-year-old.     Multimedia Feature  We Witnessed South Sudans Anguish  Our reporters went to South Sudan and found that the worlds newest nation has not turned out the way it was supposed to.         OPEN Multimedia Feature      So last month when Unicef offered to bring a team from The New York Times to witness a former child soldiers reunion with his mother in South Sudan  where more than 10,000 children have been conscripted by government and rebel forces  it seemed like an ideal opportunity to learn more, from someone with firsthand experience, about how the recruitment worked, who was leading it, where the guns were coming from and why this conflict has been so brutal.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   South Sudan has been torn apart by a civil conflict for the past three years, which has proved deadly even to those trying to help. In March, six aid workers were killed along a South Sudanese highway.  Continue reading the main story         Advertisement   Continue reading the main story       When you visit a war zone, every move needs to be meticulously planned. You cant just go barreling down a road. And its not as if at the end of the day theres a reservation waiting for you at the Marriott. Whos picking you up from the airstrip? What kind of camp will you stay in? Do you need to bring your own food? What about water? Are the roads passable, or are they washed out because of the rain? Are the cars armored? The Times team  including the photographer Tyler Hicks  ended up staying in a United Nations base in Bentiu, in the north, where Duop, the child soldier (thought to be around 16) was raised. We had to bring freeze-dried rations to eat, and we mooched water off United Nations employees. The roads were dry and passable, but we ended up mostly walking because so many people had converged around the base, seeking protection. What was striking about this specific area were all the scars. Many ethnic groups in South Sudan still practice ritual scarification, so there were scars on many faces. But the land itself was terribly scarred, too. In every direction, we could see burned fields and shot-up buildings. And there were scars in peoples hearts. Just about everyone in the camp was welcoming to The Times but bitter about being trapped in a place that is essentially a prison. Many had been traumatized, especially our subject: Duops hearing had been damaged by repeated beatings, and he seemed numb to the world.   His family tried to embrace him, and Mr. Hicks photographed a cleansing ceremony to mark his homecoming, but his relatives were distraught at his condition. The war had brought back half a boy. He sat on a cot in an aunts shack, but there was no way to interview him. He was mute. The secrets he knows will remain inside him, probably forever. Jeffrey Gettlemans memoir,  Love, Africa   about finding love and finding a calling in one of the most violent yet most beautiful places in the world  will be published in May.

One big advantage a car GPS unit has over phone apps: It doesnt need a data connection to plot a route.   Credit Roger Kisby for The New York Times     The smartphone has replaced so many other devices and tools  cameras, notebooks, tape recorders  that I thought the answer was obvious when I asked Rik Paul, the autos editor at The Wirecutter, a product reviews website owned by The New York Times, if buying a GPS unit for the car made sense anymore . Boy, was I wrong. I rely on a cellphone with Google Maps to find my way around. Why would I ever want to buy a GPS unit? The major maps apps are excellent, with awesome traffic information. If Im going for a short jaunt around town, Ill always grab my phone. But for longer trips, especially, dedicated car-GPS devices have some advantages. Like what? One big advantage is that GPS devices dont rely on a data connection to plot a route. They have the map data stored inside. Ive used my phone to navigate to a rural area  say, upstate Vermont  and since the app cached the original route, it got me there just fine. But when I went to navigate out, I didnt have a data connection. So, I was out of luck.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   There are some apps that let you download the route and map information so you dont have that problem, but you have to plan ahead, whereas a GPS you keep in your glovebox is always ready to go.  Continue reading the main story         Advertisement   Continue reading the main story       OK, but what does a good GPS unit cost? Is it worth that much to avoid dead zones? In our car GPS guide , we picked the Garmin Drive 51 LMT-S as the best for most people, which costs about $170. There are less expensive ones, about $100. So, yeah, its an investment. Still, having a GPS frees your phone for other uses, such as music or calls. And the latest GPS units are now multitasking in ways that a phones navigation app cant.  Photo        While phone apps may offer better traffic information, advanced GPS units provide better onscreen directions, especially at tricky interchanges, and more precise voice directions.   Credit Roger Kisby for The New York Times    For example, Garmins entire Drive lineup can connect to a backup camera. And there are higher-end combo models that integrate a dash cam. Traditionally, a dash cam is primarily for keeping a record in case of an accident, but some of these new GPS models can also provide some pretty advanced safety features, such as forward-collision warnings, lane-departure alerts, and even the ability to automatically send a text if theres a crash. Those are features weve come to expect from new cars, but up until now were difficult to find as aftermarket add-ons for older or more basic cars. These camera-based units dont work as well as an expensive built-in system with multiple sensors, but theyre still handy features that can help combat distracted driving. What about the color -coded roads on Google Maps that warn of delays? And the Waze app, which warns of the police and accidents ahead?

Thats partly why I will grab my phone for around-town jaunts. The accuracy of Google Maps traffic is awesome. My wife will be checking it as Im driving and will say, right around this bend, it turns red. And sure enough, the traffic slows way down right at that spot. GPS devices provide traffic warnings, and a lot of them also now connect to a phone via Bluetooth for live traffic, but they dont measure up to Google or Waze in that regard. The better GPS units have better onscreen directions, especially at tricky interchanges, and they have more precise voice directions. While most navigation systems say Turn on such-and-such street. Garmins, for example, now say, Turn at the traffic light or even at the red building. This landmark-type voice guidance makes it easier to find your turn, especially when its not easy to see the street signs. How do you test all the different GPS device models? While weve compared the specs and features for more than 100 models, weve done three rounds of hands-on testing with about 20. Most of the nitty-gritty testing is done over weeks inside a car while we use the units for everyday driving.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   At times, I have mounted three units on the windshield at once  one from each major brand  to see how they compare under the same circumstances. Thats a challenge. I now record those sessions with a GoPro camera, so I can better keep my eyes on the road.   Follow Damon Darlin on Twitter @darlin .

Credit Al Drago/The New York Times     President Trump has promised to overhaul taxes, a pledge that has cheered investors . But theres a problem: He hasnt yet named the people who would do it. Any changes would be more difficult to enact without the right people in place. The last successful tax revamp, under Ronald Reagan in 1984, was a mammoth task. It took the Treasury Department 10 months to report back with possible paths. Apart from Steven Mnuchin, the Treasury secretary, none of the 27 other political appointees to the Treasury Department have been confirmed, according to the Partnership for Public Services nomination tracker. Mr. Trump has announced only six other Treasury appointees and has yet to name anyone as assistant secretary of tax policy. The six appointees, though, have been well received on Capitol Hill.

Wells Fargo Whistle-Blower Wins His Job Back A federal regulator has ordered Wells Fargo to pay $5.4 million to a former manager who said he had been fired after reporting what he suspected was fraudulent behavior. The Labor Departments Occupational Safety and Health Administration also said that the bank must hire him back . The sum is the largest individual award ever ordered through OSHAs whistle-blower protection program, said Barbara Goto, the agencys regional administrator in San Francisco. The manager was not named, but he worked in the banks wealth management group. It is also not clear whether the suspected fraud he was trying to report was part of the scandal over fake accounts that has engulfed the bank in recent months. Wells Fargo said that it would fight the ruling and that it did not yet know whether the former employee would return to his previous position.

As Teslas sales have risen, conventional automakers have struggled to convince investors that they are at the forefront of the new technology being developed for self-driving vehicles or electric cars . Its almost like Tesla is positioned in peoples minds as an energy storage company that happens to put most of its batteries on wheels, said Andrew Stewart, chief investment officer at Exchange Capital Management. Still, the road ahead may not be so smooth for Tesla, which has set some ambitious goals to sell its new, cheaper model at far greater volumes. Keeping It in the Family Ferdinand Piech, the former chief executive of Volkswagen, has agreed to sell most of his 15 percent stake in the family holding company to his relatives, averting the turmoil that might have ensued if an outside shareholder had come in. The stake was valued at more than $1 billion and would have been attractive to Chinese investors, among others. The Porsche and the Piech families own Porsche Automobil Holding, which owns 52 percent of Volkswagens voting shares.
