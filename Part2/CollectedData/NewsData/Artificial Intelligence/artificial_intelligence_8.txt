Paper, $16. HEART OF THE MACHINE Our Future in a World of Artificial Emotional Intelligence By Richard Yonck 312 pp. Arcade Publishing. $25.99. Books about science and especially computer science often suffer from one of two failure modes. Treatises by scientists sometimes fail to clearly communicate insights. Conversely, the work of journalists and other professional writers may exhibit a weak understanding of the science in the first place. Luke Dormehl is the rare lay person  a journalist and filmmaker  who actually understands the science (and even the math) and is able to parse it in an edifying and exciting way. He is also a gifted storyteller who interweaves the personal stories with the broad history of artificial intelligence. I found myself turning the pages of Thinking Machines to find out what happens, even though I was there for much of it, and often in the very room.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   Dormehl starts with the 1964 Worlds Fair  held only miles from where I lived as a high school student in Queens  evoking the anticipation of a nation working on sending a man to the moon. He identifies the early examples of artificial intelligence that captured my own excitement at the time, like IBMs demonstrations of automated handwriting recognition and language translation. He writes as if he had been there.  Photo        Dormehl describes the early bifurcation of the field into the Symbolic and Connectionist schools, and he captures key points that many historians miss, such as the uncanny confidence of Frank Rosenblatt, the Cornell professor who pioneered the first popular neural network (he called them perceptrons). I visited Rosenblatt in 1962 when I was 14, and he was indeed making fantastic claims for this technology, saying it would eventually perform a very wide range of tasks at human levels, including speech recognition, translation and even language comprehension. As Dormehl recounts, these claims were ridiculed at the time, and indeed the machine Rosenblatt showed me in 1962 couldnt perform any of these things. In 1969, funding for the neural net field was obliterated for about two decades when Marvin Minsky and his M.I.T. colleague Seymour Papert published the book Perceptrons, which proved a theorem that perceptrons could not distinguish a connected figure (in which all parts are connected to each other) from a disconnected figure, something a human can do easily.  Continue reading the main story         Advertisement   Continue reading the main story       What Rosenblatt told me in 1962 was that the key to the perceptron achieving human levels of intelligence in many areas of learning was to stack the perceptrons in layers, with the output of one layer forming the input to the next. As it turns out, the Minsky-Papert perceptron theorem applies only to single-layer perceptrons. As Dormehl recounts, Rosenblatt died in 1971 without having had the chance to respond to Minsky and Paperts book. It would be decades before multi-layer neural nets proved Rosenblatts prescience. Minsky was my mentor for 54 years until his death a year ago, and in recent years he lamented the success of his book and had become respectful of the recent gains in neural net technology. As Rosenblatt had predicted, neural nets were indeed providing near human-level (and in some cases superhuman levels) of performance on a wide range of intelligent tasks, from translating languages to driving cars to playing Go. Dormehl examines the pending social and economic impact of artificial intelligence, for example on employment. He recounts the positive history of automation. In 1900, about 40 percent of American workers were employed on farms and over 20 percent in factories. By 2015, these figures had fallen to 2 percent on farms and 8.7 percent in factories. Yet for every job that was eliminated, we invented several new ones, with the work force growing from 24 million people (31 percent of the population in 1900) to 142 million (44 percent of the population in 2015). The average job today pays 11 times as much per hour in constant dollars as it did a century ago. Many economists are saying that while this may all be true, the future will be different because of the unprecedented acceleration of progress. Although expressing some cautions, Dormehl shares my optimism that we will be able to deploy artificial intelligence in the role of brain extenders to keep ahead of this economic curve. As he writes, Barring some catastrophic risk, A.I. will represent an overall net positive for humanity when it comes to employment. Many observers of A.I. and the other 21st-century exponential technologies like biotechnology and nanotechnology attempt to peer into the continuing accelerating gains and fall off the horse. Dormehl ends his book still in the saddle, discussing the prospect of conscious A.I.s that will demand and/or deserve rights, and the possibility of uploading our brains to the cloud. I recommend this book to anyone with a lay scientific background who wants to understand what I would argue is todays most important revolution, where it came from, how it works and what is on the horizon.  Photo        Heart of the Machine, the futurist Richard Yoncks new book, contains its important insight in the title. People often think of feelings as secondary or as a sideshow to intellect, as if the essence of human intelligence is the ability to think logically. If that were true, then machines are already ahead of us. The superiority of human thinking lies in our ability to express a loving sentiment, to create and appreciate music, to get a joke. These are all examples of emotional intelligence, and emotion is at both the bottom and top of our thinking. We still have that old reptilian brain that provides our basic motivations for meeting our physical needs and to which we can trace feelings like anger and jealousy. The neocortex, a layer covering the brain, emerged in mammals two hundred million years ago and is organized as a hierarchy of modules. Two million years ago, we got these big foreheads that house the frontal cortex and enabled us to process language and music. Yonck provides a compelling and thorough history of the interaction between our emotional lives and our technology. He starts with the ability of the early hominids to fashion stone tools, perhaps the earliest example of technology. Remarkably the complex skills required were passed down from one generation to the next for over three million years, despite the fact that for most of this period, language had not yet been invented. Yonck makes a strong case that it was our early ability to communicate through pre-language emotional expressions that enabled the remarkable survival of this skill, and enabled technology to take root. Yonck describes todays emerging technologies for understanding our emotions using images of facial expressions, intonation patterns, respiration, galvanic skin response and other signals  and how these instruments might be adopted by the military and interactive augmented reality experiences. And he recounts how all communication technologies from the first books to todays virtual reality have had significant sexual applications and will enhance sensual experiences in the future.

He imagines, for example, a scenario a few decades from now with a spirited exchange at the dinner table. No daughter of mine is marrying a robot and thats final! a father exclaims. His daughter angrily replies: Michael is a cybernetic person with the same rights you and I have! Were getting married and theres nothing you can do to change that! She storms out of the room.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   Yonck concludes that we will merge with our technology  a position I agree with  and that we have been doing so for a long time. He argues, as have I, that merging with future superintelligent A.I.s is our best strategy for ensuring a beneficial outcome. Achieving this requires creating technology that can understand and master human emotion. To those who would argue that such a quest is arrogantly playing God, he says simply: This is what we do.

Burr, Republican of North Carolina, in January at hearing of the Senate Intelligence Committee, which they oversee.   Credit Al Drago/The New York Times     WASHINGTON  The former president denied it. So did the former national intelligence director. The F.B.I. director has said privately that it is false. The speaker of the House and the chairmen of the House and Senate Intelligence Committees  all three Republican  see no indications that it happened. But President Trump insists he is right. No matter how many officials, even in his own party, dismiss his unsubstantiated claim that President Barack Obama secretly tapped his phones last year, the White House made clear on Thursday that it would stand by the assertion. Ultimately, it insisted, the president will be proved correct. Nearly two weeks after Mr. Trump first accused his predecessor in a series of Saturday morning Twitter posts , the standoff between the president and the available record has come to shadow the White House even as it tries to overhaul the nations health care system and drastically rewrite the federal budget. Much like his longstanding assertion that Mr. Obama was not born in the United States, Mr. Trump dismisses contrary information with undiminished surety. Indeed, the White House even added a new assertion on Thursday during a fiercely combative and sometimes surreal briefing by the press secretary, Sean Spicer, who berated reporters and read from news accounts that either did not back up the presidents claims or had been refuted by intelligence officials.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   One report that Mr. Spicer read contended that Mr. Obama used Britains Government Communications Headquarters, the signals agency known as GCHQ, to spy on Mr. Trump. In effect, the White House was embracing a claim that the United States closest ally collaborated with a president against a presidential candidate.  Continue reading the main story         Advertisement   Continue reading the main story       Theres widespread reporting that throughout the 2016 election, there was surveillance that was done on a variety of people, Mr. Spicer said. Asked if the president stood by his original allegation, Mr. Spicer said, He stands by it.

Privacy Policy  Opt out or contact us anytime      The White House defiance came shortly after the top two senators overseeing the intelligence community joined the chorus of lawmakers debunking the claim. Based on the information available to us, we see no indications that Trump Tower was the subject of surveillance by any element of the United States government either before or after Election Day 2016, Senator Richard M. Burr, Republican of North Carolina, and Senator Mark Warner, Democrat of Virginia, said in a statement . The blunt conclusion by the leaders of the Senate Intelligence Committee means that all four congressional leaders who oversee intelligence-based surveillance by the government have rejected Mr. Trumps claim. On Wednesday, their counterparts on the House Intelligence Committee, Representatives Devin Nunes, a Republican, and Adam B. Schiff, a Democrat, both from California, made similar statements . For the presidents staff, the continuing furor over his claim has produced mixed responses. Some advisers, privately recognizing that there is no evidence to support it, are increasingly frustrated that it continues to dominate the conversation in Washington and wish Mr. Trump would find a way to let it go. At the same time, they feel besieged by what they see as a hostile Washington establishment and resent the carping. In some cases, as Mr. Spicer did at his briefing, they argue that the news media has cherry-picked information to make the president look bad. But they assume that Mr. Trump will stick by his assertion no matter what comes out of an emerging congressional investigation. After all, he refused to back off his birther allegation  and then only grudgingly  until five years after Mr. Obama produced a birth certificate showing that he had been born in Hawaii.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   In this case, Mr. Trump sees the surveillance allegation as a way to push back against what he considers the unfair insinuation that he somehow colluded with the Russians during last years election  another assertion for which intelligence committee leaders have said they so far have found no evidence.  Video   'No Evidence' of Wiretap at Trump Tower    Representatives Devin Nunes and Adam B. Schiff of the House Intelligence Committee told reporters there was "no evidence" to support President Trump's claim that he was wiretapped by President Barack Obama.  By REUTERS.  Photo by Gabriella Demczuk for The New York Times.  Watch in Times Video          embed            In recent days, the president and his aides have tried to recast his original assertion to make it more defensible. Mr. Trump and Mr. Spicer have both noted that in two Twitter posts the president used quotation marks around the phrases wires tapped or wire tapping, which they said indicated that they were not meant to be taken literally. That really covers surveillance and many other things, Mr. Trump told Tucker Carlson in an interview on Wednesday night on Fox News. Nobody ever talks about the fact that it was in quotes, but thats a very important thing. That, however, ignores the fact that two other messages Mr. Trump posted that morning did not use quotation marks and were pretty specific. How low has President Obama gone to tapp my phones during the very sacred election process, he wrote in one, misspelling the word tap. This is Nixon/Watergate. Bad (or sick) guy! Mr. Trump also suggested that he had secret evidence no one else had seen. He told Mr. Carlson that he will be submitting things before the committee very soon that hasnt been submitted as of yet  but its potentially a very serious situation. Mr. Trump added, Youre going to find some very interesting items coming to the forefront over the next two weeks. The White House staff took its cue from that interview and mapped out an aggressive defense on Thursday. Mr. Trump was already angry that two courts had blocked his temporary travel ban even though he had been assured by his staff that his latest one would pass judicial muster. So Mr. Spicer headed to the lectern on Thursday primed for a fight and armed with a stack of news clippings that he read at length to justify the presidents claim. The bottom line is the investigation by the House and the Senate has not been provided all the information, Mr. Spicer said. But Rachel Cohen, a spokeswoman for Mr. Warner, later responded: The bipartisan leaders of the Intelligence Committee would not have made the statement they made without having been fully briefed by the appropriate authorities.  Video   White House Alleges That Britain Spied    Sean Spicer, the White House press secretary, on Thursday quoted Fox News coverage implicating Britains Government Communications Headquarters in a wiretapping of Trump Tower. President Trump stands by his original accusations of surveillance, Mr. Spicer said.  By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS.  Photo by Al Drago/The New York Times.  Watch in Times Video          embed            At the White House briefing, among the articles Mr. Spicer read from were several from The New York Times. However, none of them actually reported that Mr. Obama had authorized surveillance of Mr. Trump or that Mr. Trump had been eavesdropped. The Times has reported that law enforcement agencies are investigating contacts between some associates of Mr. Trump and Russian figures and had access to intercepted communications.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   Other news reports cited by Mr. Trump on Wednesday night and Mr. Spicer on Thursday repeated months-old claims that a secret foreign intelligence court had approved a surveillance order involving Mr. Trump in October. Reporters from The Times have not been able to corroborate the existence of such an order. The British assertions came from a Fox News commentator, Andrew Napolitano. Early on Friday, GCHQ, the British communications intelligence agency, issued a statement denying that it had wiretapped Mr. Trump during the presidential campaign, saying that the allegations were nonsense. They are utterly ridiculous and should be ignored. The agency rarely comments on intelligence matters; its statement was both unusual and unusually vehement. Mr. Spicer complained that reporters had not focused on a comment by Mr. Nunes, the House intelligence chairman, that its possible that intelligence agencies could have swept up others in the course of their surveillance, including Mr. Trump. Mr. Nunes did note that Mr. Trump was concerned about other surveillance activities looking at him and his associates and said his committee would find out. But Mr. Nunes was firm in saying that Mr. Trumps original Twitter posts were not borne out by the facts. I dont believe there was an actual tap of Trump Tower, he said on Wednesday. If Mr. Trumps posts were to be taken literally, then clearly the president was wrong, Mr. Nunes said. That was not a word the White House was willing to use on Thursday. Asked if Mr. Trump would apologize to Mr. Obama if it turned out he was wrong, Mr. Spicer demurred. Were not going to prejudge what the outcome of this is, he said. I think weve got to let the process work its will, and then when theres a report that comes out conclusive from there, then well be able to comment.

Bogachev. The F.B.I. has offered a $3 million bounty for his capture, the most ever for a cybercriminal. Credit FBI By  Michael Schwirtz and Joseph Goldstein March 12, 2017 To the F.B.I., Evgeniy M. Bogachev is the most wanted cybercriminal in the world. The bureau has announced a $3 million bounty for his capture, the most ever for computer crimes, and has been trying to track his movements in hopes of grabbing him if he strays outside his home turf in Russia. He has been indicted in the United States, accused of creating a sprawling network of virus-infected computers to siphon hundreds of millions of dollars from bank accounts around the world, targeting anyone with enough money worth stealing  from a pest control company in North Carolina to a police department in Massachusetts to a Native American tribe in Washington. In December, the Obama administration announced sanctions against Mr. Bogachev and five others in response to intelligence agencies conclusions that Russia had meddled in the presidential election. Publicly, law enforcement officials said it was his criminal exploits that landed Mr. Bogachev on the sanctions list, not any specific role in the hacking of the Democratic National Committee. But it is clear that for Russia, he is more than just a criminal. At one point, Mr. Bogachev had control over as many as a million computers in multiple countries, with possible access to everything from family vacation photographs and term papers to business proposals and highly confidential personal information. It is almost certain that computers belonging to government officials and contractors in a number of countries were among the infected devices. For Russias surveillance-obsessed intelligence community, Mr. Bogachevs exploits may have created an irresistible opportunity for espionage. While Mr. Bogachev was draining bank accounts, it appears that the Russian authorities were looking over his shoulder, searching the same computers for files and emails. In effect, they were grafting an intelligence operation onto a far-reaching cybercriminal scheme, sparing themselves the hard work of hacking into the computers themselves, officials said. The Russians were particularly interested, it seems, in information from military and intelligence services regarding fighting in eastern Ukraine and the war in Syria, according to law enforcement officials and the cybersecurity firm Fox-IT. But there also appear to have been attempts to gain access to sensitive military and intelligence information on infected computers in the United States, often consisting of searches for documents containing the words top secret or Department of Defense. The Russian government has plenty of its own cyberspace tools for gathering intelligence. But the piggybacking on Mr. Bogachevs activities offers some clues to the breadth and creativity of Russias espionage efforts at a time when the United States and Europe are scrambling to counter increasingly sophisticated attacks capable of destroying critical infrastructure, disrupting bank operations, stealing government secrets and undermining democratic elections. This relationship is illustrated by the improbable mix of characters targeted with the sanctions announced by the Obama administration. Four were senior officers with Russias powerful military intelligence agency, the G.R.U. Two were suspected cyberthieves on the F.B.I.s most wanted list: an ethnic Russian from Latvia named Alexsey Belan with a red-tinted Justin Bieber haircut, and Mr. Bogachev, whose F.B.I. file includes a photograph of him holding his spotted Bengal cat while wearing a matching set of leopard-print pajamas. From Thief to Russian Asset? His involvement with Russian intelligence may help explain why Mr. Bogachev, 33, is hardly a man on the run. F.B.I. officials say he lives openly in Anapa, a run-down resort town on the Black Sea in southern Russia. He has a large apartment near the shore and possibly another in Moscow, officials say, as well as a collection of luxury cars, though he seems to favor driving his Jeep Grand Cherokee. American investigators say he enjoys sailing and owns a yacht. Image Anapa, Russia, a resort town on the Black Sea where Mr. Bogachev lives. Credit Dmitry Feoktistov/TASS, via Getty Images Running the criminal scheme was hard work. Mr. Bogachev often complained of being exhausted and of having too little time for his family, said Aleksandr Panin, a Russian hacker, now in a federal prison in Kentucky for bank fraud, who used to communicate with Mr. Bogachev online. He mentioned a wife and two kids as far as I remember, Mr. Panin wrote in an email. Beyond that, little is known about Mr. Bogachev, who preferred to operate anonymously behind various screen names: slavik, lucky12345, pollingsoon. Even close business associates never met him in person or knew his real name. He was very, very paranoid, said J. Keith Mularski, an F.B.I. supervisor in Pittsburgh whose investigation of Mr. Bogachev led to an indictment in 2014. He didnt trust anybody. Russia does not have an extradition treaty with the United States, and Russian officials say that so long as Mr. Bogachev has not committed a crime on Russian territory, there are no grounds to arrest him. Attempts to reach Mr. Bogachev for this article were unsuccessful. In response to questions, his lawyer in Anapa, Aleksei Stotskii, said, The fact that he is wanted by the F.B.I. prevents me morally from saying anything. A line in Mr. Bogachevs file with the Ukrainian Interior Ministry, which has helped the F.B.I. track his movements, describes him as working under the supervision of a special unit of the F.S.B., referring to the Federal Security Service, Russias main intelligence agency. The F.S.B. did not respond to a request for comment. That Mr. Bogachev remains at large is the most powerful argument that he is an asset of the Russian government, said Austin Berglas, who was an assistant special agent in charge of cyberinvestigations out of the F.B.I.s New York field office until 2015. Hackers like Mr. Bogachev are moonlighters, Mr. Berglas said, doing the bidding of Russian intelligence services, whether economic espionage or straight-up espionage. Such an arrangement offers the Kremlin a convenient cover story and an easy opportunity to take a peek into the extensive networks of computers infected by Russian hackers, security experts say. Russian intelligence agencies also appear to occasionally employ malware tools developed for criminal purposes, including the popular BlackEnergy, to attack the computers of enemy governments. The recent revelations by WikiLeaks about C.I.A. spying tools suggest that the agency also kept a large reference library of hacking kits, some of which appear to have been produced by Russia. It also hints at a struggle to recruit top talent. A job with the Russian intelligence agencies does not command the prestige it did in the Soviet era. The Russian state has to compete against the dream of six-figure salaries and stock options in Silicon Valley. A recruiting pitch from a few years ago for the Defense Ministrys cyberwarfare brigade offered college graduates the rank of lieutenant and a bed in a room with four other people.

Criminal charges against Mr. Bogachev were also unsealed. Credit Gary Cameron/Reuters And so the Kremlin at times turns to the dark web or Russian-language forums devoted to cyberfraud and spam. Mr. Bogachev, according to court papers from his criminal case, used to sell malicious software on a site called Carding World, where thieves buy and sell stolen credit card numbers and hacking kits, according to the F.B.I. One recent posting offered to sell American credit card information with CVV security numbers for $5. A user named MrRaiX was selling a malware supposedly designed to pilfer passwords from programs like Google Chrome and Outlook Express. Rather than shut down such sites, as the F.B.I. typically tries to do, Russian intelligence agents appear to have infiltrated them, security experts say. Some of the forums state specifically that almost any type of criminality is allowed  bank fraud, counterfeiting documents, weapons sales. One of the few rules: no work in Russia or the former Soviet Union. In Carding World, and in many other forums, a violation results in a lifetime ban. The F.B.I. has long been stymied in its efforts to get Russian cybercriminals. For a time, the bureau had high hopes that its agents and Russian investigators with the F.S.B. would work together to target Russian thieves who had made a specialty of stealing Americans credit card information and breaking into their bank accounts. Heres to great investigations, F.B.I. and F.S.B. agents would toast each other at Manhattan steakhouses during periodic trust-building visits, Mr. Berglas said. But help rarely seemed to materialize. After a while, agents began to worry that the Russian authorities were recruiting the very suspects that the F.B.I. was pursuing. The joke among Justice Department officials was the Russians were more likely to pin a medal on a suspected criminal hacker than help the F.B.I. nab him. Almost all the hackers who have been announced by the U.S. government through indictments are immediately tracked by the Russian government, said Arkady Bukh, a New York-based lawyer who often represents Russian hackers arrested in the United States. All the time theyre asked to provide logistical and technical support. While it was a widely held suspicion, it is tough to prove the connection between cyberthieves and Russian intelligence. But in one case, Mr. Berglas said, F.B.I. agents monitoring an infected computer were surprised to see a hacker who was the target of their investigation share a copy of his passport with a person the F.B.I. believed to be a Russian intelligence agent  a likely signal that the suspect was being recruited or protected. That was the closest we ever came, he said. Fishing for Top Secrets Mr. Bogachevs hacking career began well over a decade ago, leading to the creation of a malicious software program called GameOver ZeuS, which he managed with the help of about a half-dozen close associates who called themselves the Business Club, according to the F.B.I. and security researchers. Working around the clock, his criminal gang infected an ever-growing network of computers. It was able to bypass the most advanced banking security measures to quickly empty accounts and transfer the money abroad through a web of intermediaries called money mules. F.B.I. officials said it was the most sophisticated online larceny scheme they had encountered  and for years, it was impenetrable. Mr. Bogachev became extremely wealthy. At one point, he owned two villas in France and kept a fleet of cars parked around Europe so he would never have to rent a vehicle while on vacation, according to a Ukrainian law enforcement official with knowledge of the Bogachev case, who requested anonymity to discuss the continuing investigation. Officials say he had three Russian passports with different aliases allowing him to travel undercover. At the height of his operations, Mr. Bogachev had between 500,000 and a million computers under his control, American officials said. And there is evidence that the Russian government took an interest in knowing what was on them. Beginning around 2011, according to an analysis by Fox-IT, computers under Mr. Bogachevs control started receiving requests for information  not about banking transactions, but for files relating to various geopolitical developments pulled from the headlines. Around the time that former President Barack Obama publicly agreed to start sending small arms and ammunition to Syrian rebels , in 2013, Turkish computers infected by Mr. Bogachevs network were hit with keyword searches that included the terms weapon delivery and arms delivery. There were also searches for Russian mercenary and Caucasian mercenary, suggesting concerns about Russian citizens fighting in the war. Ahead of Russias military intervention in Ukraine in 2014, infected computers were searched for information about top-secret files from the countrys main intelligence directorate, the S.B.U. Some of the queries involved searches for personal information about government security officials, including emails from Georgias foreign intelligence service, the Turkish Foreign Ministry and others, said Michael Sandee, one of the researchers from Fox-IT. And at some point between March 2013 and February 2014, there were searches for English-language documents, which seemed to be fishing for American military and intelligence documents. The queries were for terms including top secret and Department of Defense, said Brett Stone-Gross, a cybersecurity analyst involved in analyzing GameOver ZeuS. These were in English, he said. That was different. Cybersecurity experts who studied the case say there is no way to know who ordered the queries. But they were so disconnected from the larceny and fraud that drove Mr. Bogachevs operation that analysts say there can be no other motive but espionage. Whether the searches turned up any classified document or sensitive government material is unknown, although the odds are good that there were a number of federal government employees or military contractors with infected personal computers. They had such a large number of infections, I would say its highly likely they had computers belonging to U.S. government and foreign government employees, Mr. Stone-Gross said. In the summer of 2014, the F.B.I., together with law enforcement agencies in over half a dozen countries, carried out Operation Tovar, a coordinated attack on Mr. Bogachevs criminal infrastructure that shut down his network and liberated computers infected with GameOver ZeuS. Prosecutors said they were in talks with the Russian government, trying to secure cooperation for the capture of Mr. Bogachev. But the only apparent legal trouble Mr. Bogachev has faced in Russia was a lawsuit filed against him by a real estate company in 2011 over payment of about $75,000 on his apartment in Anapa, according to court papers there. And even that he managed to beat. These days, officials believe Mr. Bogachev is living under his own name in Anapa and occasionally takes boat trips to Crimea, the Ukrainian peninsula that Russia occupied in 2014. Mr. Mularski, the F.B.I. supervisor, said his agents were still pursuing leads.

Credit Brendan Smialowski/Agence France-Presse  Getty Images     Alexsey Belans career as a successful cyberthief was nearly derailed in 2013 when he was arrested in Greece at the request of American authorities. But he evaded extradition and slipped back into Russia. Back at home, Mr. Belan stayed busy stealing credit cards and populating the internet with ads for erectile dysfunction treatments, but he was no longer working only for himself. He was put to work by Russias main intelligence directorate, the Federal Security Service, or F.S.B., on a very ambitious project: to breach Yahoo and steal account information from hundreds of millions of users. The relationship between Mr. Belan and two Russian agents  Dmitry Aleksandrovich Dokuchaev and Igor Anatolyevich Sushchin  was described in an indictment unsealed on Wednesday in federal court in San Francisco. If true, the allegations offer an extraordinary case study of Russian cyberespionage, and particularly the symbiotic relationship between identity thieves and spammers and Russias elite intelligence services. Cybersecurity experts and the F.B.I. have long suspected that Russian spies employed and protected criminal hackers to a striking degree, but evidence has been scarce. The indictment made public on Wednesday describes this collusion in detail for the first time.  Photo        Alexsey Belan.   Credit F.B.I.    The Justice Department alleges that the F.S.B. agents provided Mr. Belan with the tools of Russian spycraft to minimize detection by American law enforcement. At their direction, he helped surveil foreign officials and even Russian citizens, including a newspaper reporter and an officer with the Internal Affairs Ministry.

Continue reading the main story         Advertisement   Continue reading the main story       Exactly what information the Russian spies obtained is not clear from the court papers. But prosecutors noted that some of the accounts that were penetrated belonged to American government officials, including cybersecurity, diplomatic, military and White House personnel, according to the indictment. The court papers also outlined a secondary scheme, in which the F.S.B. officers paid a Canadian hacker to breach individual Gmail accounts. The indictment reveals varying tactics used by Russian intelligence at a time when officials are still investigating what the American intelligence community has characterized as Russian attempts to meddle in the 2016 election. There were low-tech strategies like the basic spear-phishing attacks that have become a fact of life for anyone online. And more exotic schemes, such as tricking Yahoo into believing that a computer in Russia was in fact a certain users home computer, allowing Russian intelligence officials instant access to an email account without a password.

Russian government officials were among the victims  including an officer with the Russian Internal Affairs Ministrys cybercrime unit  suggesting that the F.S.B. was using its own intelligence resources to gain an advantage over a rival agency. All Russian intel agencies are competitive and carnivorous, Mark Galeotti, a Russia expert at the Institute of International Relations in Prague, said. Mr. Belan, who is 29 and has red-tinted hair, came into the F.B.I.s cross hairs about five years ago, and was previously indicted on charges related to hacking into e-commerce companies. In December, in response to the American intelligence communitys conclusion that Russia had tried to meddle in the presidential election, the Obama administration announced sanctions against Mr. Belan and Evgeniy M. Bogachev , who is also suspected of being a cyberthief and appears also to have ties to Russian intelligence. Arkady Bukh, the Manhattan lawyer who represented Mr. Belan after his arrest in Greece, said he had not heard from Mr. Belan since he skipped bail and returned to Russia in 2013.  Photo        Dmitry Aleksandrovich Dokuchaev.   Credit F.B.I.    For the last couple of years he cannot be reached, Mr. Bukh said. He disappeared. But even while working under Russian intelligence, Mr. Belan kept up his old rackets. Once he breached Yahoo, he began searching for things to steal, such as gift cards or credit card numbers found in email accounts. According to the indictment, he ran a large spam campaign, and also tweaked some of the servers associated with Yahoos search engine so that men searching for erectile dysfunction medication would be redirected to an online pharmacy that paid him a commission for driving traffic to the site.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   The indictment does not say how Mr. Belan was recruited, or whether the idea for the Yahoo breach originated with him or the F.S.B. Nor does the indictment say how the F.B.I. identified Mr. Belan and the F.S.B. agents. Officials provided little information about Mr. Sushchin, 43, an F.S.B. supervisor who the indictment says was embedded as a cybersecurity expert in a Russian financial firm. But there is plenty of intrigue swirling about Mr. Dokuchaev, 33, whom the indictment describes as Mr. Belans direct F.S.B. contact. In Russia, Mr. Dokuchaev was arrested on suspicion of treason in early December and accused of passing secret information to the United States. The authorities have offered no public details of the charges, in what is the highest-profile counterintelligence detentions in the post-Soviet period. After the arrests, RBC, a respected Moscow newspaper, described Mr. Dokuchaev as a former hacker using the online pseudonym Forb  who agreed work for the F.S.B. to avoid prosecution for credit card fraud. In an interview with Vedomosti newspaper in 2004, a hacker identified as Forb bragged about hacking a U.S. government website, calling it his crowning achievement.

Watch in Times Video          embed            Two senior White House officials suggested on Monday that President Trumps unsubstantiated claim that President Barack Obama had tapped his telephone was not meant to be taken literally, arguing that Mr. Trump had been referring more broadly to a variety of surveillance efforts during the 2016 campaign when he made the incendiary accusation. He doesnt really think that President Obama went up and tapped his phone personally, said Sean Spicer, the White House press secretary. In fact, Mr. Spicer said, when Mr. Trump charged in a Twitter post last weekend that Mr. Obama had my wires tapped in Trump Tower, he was referring generally to surveillance activities during the 2016 race  not to an actual telephone wiretap. The president was very clear in his tweet that it was, you know, wiretapping, Mr. Spicer said, using his fingers to make a gesture suggesting quotation marks. That spans a whole host of surveillance types of options.

Continue reading the main story         Advertisement   Continue reading the main story       The remarks were the first time the White House sought to explain the accusation Mr. Trump made in a series of posts on Twitter saying Mr. Obama was tapping my phones and calling the former president a bad (or sick) guy. The explanations came as the Justice Department asked the leaders of the House Intelligence Committee, who had given a Monday deadline to produce proof of Mr. Trumps claim, for more time to determine what if any responsive documents exist. Kellyanne Conway, Mr. Trumps senior adviser, said in an interview on Sunday that Mr. Obama could have employed any number of devices other than a traditional telephone wiretap, even including a microwave oven. Ms. Conway clarified on Monday that she was not accusing the former president of snooping via a kitchen appliance, arguing that her comments had been taken out of context. Im not Inspector Gadget, she said Monday on CNN. I dont believe people are using the microwave to spy on the Trump campaign. But in an interview with a columnist for The Record of Bergen County, N.J., the day before, she said Mr. Obamas alleged spying efforts against Mr. Trump could have been far more extensive than a telephone wiretap.

Credit Doug Mills/The New York Times    What I can say is there are many ways to surveil each other, Ms. Conway told the paper. You can surveil someone through their phones, certainly through their television sets  any number of ways.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   Surveillance can even be carried out with microwaves that turn into cameras, she added. We know this is a fact of modern life. The unusual and shifting explanations from Mr. Spicer and Ms. Conway reflected the contortions that members of Mr. Trumps inner circle have employed to explain the presidents explosive accusation, which he has yet to address personally. Neither Mr. Trump nor anyone at the White House has presented any evidence for the claim, instead asking Congress to investigate it as part of its inquiry into Russias interference in the presidential election.

He suggested that Mr. Trump had relied on multiple news reports, including in The New York Times, to make his charge. It is interesting how many news outlets reported that this activity was taking place during the 2016 election cycle, and now are wondering where the proof is, Mr. Spicer said. The Times and other news outlets have reported extensively on surveillance in the United States during the 2016 presidential campaign, particularly related to Russias efforts to influence the election . But The Times has never reported that intelligence or law-enforcement officials were themselves spying on Mr. Trump. What The Times and other news organizations have reported is that American intelligence agencies have communication intercepts that officials believe show contacts between associates of Mr. Trump and Russian officials during the campaign. Still, several far-right websites, including Infowars, which traffics in conspiracy theories and whose eccentric operator, Alex Jones , has interviewed Mr. Trump, have erroneously asserted that The Times and others had reported that the president was under surveillance. In a story dated March 6, Infowars cited a Jan. 19 article in The Times detailing how American law enforcement and intelligence agencies were examining intercepted communications as part of a broad investigation into possible links between Russian officials and Trump associates. Flashback: NYT admits wiretaps used against Trump, the headline read. The story noted that The Times didnt specifically mention that Trump himself, or Trump Tower, was bugged, but the caveat has not stopped Mr. Trumps supporters from insisting that The Times was a source for the presidents tweet. Ms. Conway told CNN that in her interview, she had not been referring to the presidents charges when she talked about microwave surveillance, nor could she offer any proof of his allegations.

Ms. Conway said she had never meant to imply that Mr. Obama had used a microwave to spy on Mr. Trump.   Matthew Rosenberg contributed reporting.

At a subsequent press briefing, he was asked about recent wiretapping claims and made a joke that seemingly referred to reports that the United States had bugged Ms. Merkel's phone during the Obama administration.  By REUTERS.  Photo by Stephen Crowley/The New York Times.  Watch in Times Video          embed            WASHINGTON  President Trump provoked a rare public dispute with Americas closest ally on Friday after his White House aired an explosive and unsubstantiated claim that Britain s spy agency had secretly eavesdropped on him at the behest of President Barack Obama during last years campaign. Livid British officials adamantly denied the allegation and secured promises from senior White House officials never to repeat it. But a defiant Mr. Trump refused to back down, making clear that the White House had nothing to retract or apologize for because his spokesman had simply repeated an assertion made by a Fox News commentator. Fox itself later disavowed the report. The rupture with London was Mr. Trumps latest quarrel with an ally or foreign power since taking office. Mexicos president angrily canceled a White House visit in January over Mr. Trumps proposed border wall. A telephone call with Australias prime minister ended abruptly amid a dispute over refugees . Sweden bristled over Mr. Trumps criticism of its refugee policy . And China refused for weeks to engage with Mr. Trump because of his postelection call with Taiwans president . Mr. Trumps strained relations with Europe, which has viewed his ascension to power with trepidation, were fully on display on Friday, not just in the British spy flap but also in the venue in which it was addressed. The president was hosting for the first time Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany, who is seen by many Europeans as the most important champion of the liberal international order.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   Though polite, the two leaders seemed stiff and distant during their public appearances. European news outlets and social media made much of the fact that she suggested a handshake for photographers in the Oval Office and he did not respond, although it appeared that he did not hear her. Either way, the two were clearly on separate pages on issues like immigration and trade.  Continue reading the main story         Advertisement   Continue reading the main story       The angry response from Britain stemmed from Mr. Trumps persistence in accusing Mr. Obama of tapping his phones last year despite the lack of evidence and across-the-board denials. At a briefing on Thursday, Sean Spicer, the White House press secretary, read from a sheaf of news clippings that he suggested bolstered the presidents claim. Among them was an assertion by Andrew Napolitano, a Fox News commentator, that Mr. Obama had used Britains Government Communications Headquarters, the agency known as the GCHQ, to spy on Mr. Trump. In response to Mr. Spicer, the agency quickly denied it as nonsense and utterly ridiculous, while British officials contacted American counterparts to complain.  Video   A Timeline on Trumps Wiretap Claims    A look at the reactions, clarifications and explanations after President Trump, in a series of tweets, accused Barack Obama of tapping his phones last fall.  By SHANE ONEILL, QUYNHANH DO and MARK SCHEFFLER on Publish Date March 17, 2017.  Photo by Stephen Crowley/The New York Times.  Watch in Times Video          embed            We said nothing, Mr. Trump told a German reporter who asked about the matter at a news conference with Ms. Merkel. All we did was quote a certain very talented legal mind who was the one responsible for saying that on television. I didnt make an opinion on it. He added: You shouldnt be talking to me. You should be talking to Fox. The president tried making a joke about it, turning to Ms. Merkel, who was angered during Mr. Obamas administration by reports that the National Security Agency had tapped her cellphone and those of other leaders. At least we have something in common, perhaps, Mr. Trump said. She made a face that suggested she had no interest in getting involved. After the news conference, Mr. Spicer echoed Mr. Trumps unapologetic tone. I dont think we regret anything, he told reporters. As the president said, I was just reading off media reports. Shortly afterward, Fox backed off Mr. Napolitanos claim. Fox News cannot confirm Judge Napolitanos commentary, the anchor Shepard Smith said on air. Fox News knows of no evidence of any kind that the now president of the United States was surveilled at any time, any way. Full stop. Mr. Trumps unremorseful tenor further stunned British officials, who thought they had managed to contain the matter. Kim Darroch, the British ambassador to the United States, had raised the matter on Thursday night with Mr. Spicer at a St. Patricks Day reception in Washington. Mark Lyall Grant, the national security adviser to Prime Minister Theresa May of Britain, had contacted his American counterpart, Lt. Gen. H. R. McMaster.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   On Friday morning, a spokesman for Mrs. May said the White House had backed off the allegation. Weve made clear to the administration that these claims are ridiculous and should be ignored, the spokesman said, on the condition of anonymity in keeping with British protocol. Weve received assurances these allegations wont be repeated. But White House officials, who also requested anonymity, said Mr. Spicer had offered no regret to the ambassador. He didnt apologize, no way, no how, a senior West Wing official said. The officials said they did not know whether General McMaster had apologized. The furor underscored the continuing troubles for the White House since Mr. Trump first accused Mr. Obama of tapping his phones, an allegation refuted by intelligence agencies as well as Republican and Democratic officials. Even as Mr. Trump refused to back down, fellow Republicans appeared increasingly irritated by what they see as a distraction from their policy goals.

Frankly, unless you can produce some pretty compelling truth, I think President Obama is owed an apology, Mr. Cole told reporters. If he didnt do it, we shouldnt be reckless in accusations that he did. The conspiracy theorizing also tested what is often called the special relationship between the United States and Britain. American intelligence agencies enjoy a closer collaboration with their British counterparts than any other in the world. GCHQ was the first agency to warn the United States government that Russia was hacking Democratic Party emails during the presidential campaign. Foreign policy analysts expressed astonishment that Mr. Trump would so cavalierly endanger that partnership. It illustrates the extent to which the White House really doesnt care what damage they do to crucial relationships in order to avoid admitting their dishonesty, said Kori Schake, a former national security aide to President George W. Bush now at Stanford Universitys Hoover Institution. Americas allies are having to protect themselves against being tarred with the White Houses mendacity. Eric S. Edelman, an under secretary of defense under Mr. Bush, has written about the stresses between the United States and Britain in recent years. I hope that this latest episode doesnt drive a stake through the heart of the strongest remaining element of Anglo-American partnership, he said. Julianne Smith, who was a deputy national security adviser to Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., said Mr. Trump did not appear to realize how much American intelligence agencies depend on Britain in dealing with threats around the world. He will probably live to see the day when he will regret firing off such an egregious insult to Britain and then failing to apologize for it, she said.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   The issue clearly touched a nerve at GCHQ, which usually refuses to comment on intelligence matters. Its vehement response surprised British officials and analysts. Dominic Grieve, the intelligence committee chairman in Parliament, pointed to elaborate safeguards that prevent spying on the United States and require a valid national security purpose for any monitoring. It is inconceivable that those legal requirements could be met in the circumstances described, he said. Tim Farron, the leader of the Liberal Democrats, the junior partner in the last British coalition government, described Mr. Spicers repetition of the claims as shameful and said Mr. Trump was compromising the vital U.K.-U.S. security relationship to try to cover his own embarrassment.   Downing Street evidently wanted to avoid adding to any embarrassment in Washington while making it clear that Britain had no part in any such wiretapping. But in rebuffing that effort, Mr. Trump showed that Mrs. May, who was the first foreign leader to visit the White House after his inauguration, may not have forged the bond she had hoped, analysts said. Its very easy to have a good meeting with Trump, said Jeremy Shapiro, a former State Department official who is the research director at the European Council on Foreign Relations in London. Hes very pleasant in person. Hell promise you the world. And 48 hours later, hell betray you without a thought. He wont even know hell be betraying you.
