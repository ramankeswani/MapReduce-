QUAIN   FEB. 23, 2017      Continue reading the main story  Share This Page   Continue reading the main story            Photo        A more standardized approach to self-driving cars could reduce the amount of processors and wiring needed.   Credit Bosch     The PC revolution, the internet boom, the smartphone economy  all were propelled along by a common set of technological standards. So will a standard platform or operating system be necessary to get autonomous cars rolling, too? There is certainly no doubt that many carmakers have expressed the idea that a more standardized platform would be attractive, said John Wall, a senior vice president at QNX , which develops software that is used in millions of vehicles today. Car companies have come to realize that existing in-car systems, with their tangled layers of software and morass of hundreds of embedded processors, are slow and overly complex by todays computing standards. If autonomous cars are ever to become a reality, they will require even more powerful, more fully integrated and upgradable computing platforms, designers say. The feedback we hear is that the number of chips, the amount of wire  an Audi has over six miles of wire in it  is excessive, said Danny Shapiro, senior director of automotive at the chip maker Nvidia , which is promoting its own autonomous driving platform.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   A more centralized approach could bring huge cost savings by reducing the number of processors used in a car and thus reducing the need for the cabling among those processors. Less wiring would also lower a cars weight to improve fuel economy, Mr. Shapiro said.  Continue reading the main story         Advertisement   Continue reading the main story       Nvidia is currently working with several automakers, including Audi, which plans to have its first self-driving vehicles on the road in 2020 . A common automotive platform could also make it easier to develop new software and safety systems for self-driving cars. The goal is to reduce the cost of bringing innovation to the mass market, said Eric Montague, a senior director at the speech recognition company Nuance .     Graphic  The Race for Self-Driving Cars  There are increasing signs that autonomous cars have arrived  and may be driving on our city streets sooner than we think.         OPEN Graphic      Mr. Montague said the challenge today is that every car has a unique constellation of electronic control units, sensors and microphones. The software must be specially tailored to each model. There is no shortage of companies vying to become the equivalent for self-driving cars of the Windows/Intel standard for PCs. Chip makers like Nvidia  as well as Intel  hope to establish their hardware as the new brains behind autonomous vehicles. Delphi, QNX and Waymo (the former Google self-driving project) are looking to put their software front and center as the operating system of choice. Each wants to sell its own car platform to automakers. Some auto companies are embracing new partnerships. BMW is working with Intel, Mobileye and Here to bring self-driving cars to the road and plans to start testing such vehicles this year. Ford is working closely with QNX, a BlackBerry subsidiary, on the software needed for the vehicles it is testing. Fiat Chrysler has built a new experimental fleet of minivans for Waymo . The traditional automotive culture, however, has emphasized independence. And some industry experts point to economic factors that argue against settling on a standard platform. Being dependent on a single vendor can mean higher prices. Automakers dont want to rely on Apple or Google, said Glen DeVos, vice president for software and services at Delphi. But they also dont want to reinvent the wheel all the time.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   Emblematic of that carmaker culture is Hyundai, which is mostly going it alone in working on its self-driving entry. The company recently demonstrated how far it has come, ferrying journalists in Las Vegas around in a self-driving version of its Ioniq electric compact car. Hyundai, which likes to emphasize that it even makes its own steel, has developed its own platform, striving for affordability. You dont have to use a common system, said Cason Grover, senior group manager for vehicle technology planning innovation at Hyundai. And we dont want to go down one path that hinders us in the future from introducing new innovations. Bosch, which supplies safety and technology systems to automakers, including its own self-parking technology, acknowledges that a single, one-size-fits-all system would be easier to work with. But it would be a killer for innovation, said Detlef Zerfowski, vice president for automotive system integration at Bosch.  Photo        Hyundai is developing its own system for a self-driving version of its Ioniq electric compact car.   Credit Hyundai    Douglas L. Davis of Intel, recently charged with spearheading that companys new self-driving car platform, Go, said, Given the amount of computing power necessary for autonomous driving, we think it can benefit from greater commonality and predictable interfaces. Mobileye already has the computer vision, for example, he said. So if the technology is good, why re-engineer it and take two to three years to get it into a product? Which design philosophy one chooses can have significant repercussions when it comes to the security of robotic cars, evoking visions of hackers causing mayhem by crashing cars and trucks into each other at highway speeds. Its a problem engineers are keenly aware of. Having a common platform could have a downside, Mr. Wall at QNX acknowledged. If theres a vulnerability in one car, it could mean theres a vulnerability in every car. Conversely, Mr. Wall pointed out that de facto software standards mean that more programmers are focused on making those systems as secure as possible, versus having only a few coders working on a single, narrowly used program.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   But by developing as much of the technology as possible themselves, some automakers believe they can solve problems more quickly. A side benefit of controlling the entire thing, said Mr. Grover at Hyundai, is that we know everything thats going on. A lack of standards and a diversity of self-driving systems does present one other obvious challenge: Variety is not a virtue when cars must interact predictably with human drivers  and other robotic vehicles  to guarantee safety.  Photo        Audi, which is working with the chip maker Nvidia, plans to have its first self-driving vehicles on the road in 2020.   Credit John F. Martin for Delphi    Riding in Hyundais self-driving Ioniq, for example, is like taking a Sunday drive with your grandmother. The car is extremely adept at staying squarely in its lane without ping-ponging back and forth, but it is also cautious in the extreme, stopping nine feet short of crosswalks and stubbornly refusing to go forward if a pedestrian looks poised to step off the sidewalk. It is behavior that can ignite road rage in nearby human drivers. By comparison, Delphis test car, which uses an Intel computing platform installed in an Audi Q5 , is more aggressive. It can easily merge into highway traffic and negotiate complex intersections. However, it treats pedestrians with less deference, taking right-hand corners more quickly  even though pedestrians may be contemplating entering the crosswalk. Theres a big difference in the algorithms and even sensor choices being used, Mr. Grover said, which can affect how collision-prevention and lane-keeping systems work. When autonomous cars do hit the road, he said, you could have a fair amount of variation in how they behave. There are quite a few different approaches to creating autonomous systems, said Ralf Herrtwich of Here, which is making high-resolution maps for the next generation of vehicles. Mr. Herrtwich said the necessary standards might come not from the car platform itself, though, but from the communications side. In order to avoid accidents down the road and conditions like black ice that a cars sensors cannot detect, self-driving vehicles will have to share information with each other, through so-called V2V or vehicle-to-vehicle communication. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration has proposed that V2V equipment be installed in all cars in the future.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   Indeed, there are already cars like the 2017 BMW 5 Series that can broadcast information about road hazards over a cellular connection, but only other BMWs can make use of the warnings. Technology suppliers, platform vendors and automakers acknowledge that self-driving cars are still in their infancy and that as the vehicles mature, standards will be forthcoming. Most car manufacturers are still struggling just to establish standards across their own models and brands, Mr. DeVos of Delphi said. Once that happens, he said, then we can talk about how to work across different companies.

Credit Jabin Botsford/The New York Times     WASHINGTON  With Republicans now in power across the government, Congress has moved aggressively toward undoing Obama-era tech policies. Net neutrality , the rule that ensures equal access to all websites, and broadband privacy rules are the first targets. Lawmakers also hope to play a bigger role than in the last administration on policies of particular concern to Silicon Valley and internet users, including driverless cars and the scaling back of Federal Communications Commission powers concerning broadband providers. We talked to Senator John Thune , Republican of South Dakota, who leads the commerce committee that oversees the technology and telecommunications industries, about these efforts. The interview was edited for clarity and length. How do you want to change net neutrality rules? Were open for business. We think a legislative solution is the best alternative and that the F.C.C. under Chairman Tom Wheeler went too far with regulations that were overreaching and basically classified the internet as a public utility under a 1934 statute. Congress needs to be heard from, or you will have a constant back-and-forth on this issue depending on which party is in the White House.

Legislation would basically prevent blocking, throttling and paid prioritization but doesnt go to the extreme of reclassifying broadband as a telecommunications service.

On zero rating, F.C.C. Chairman Ajit Pai has already expressed a preference on that: It is something consumers seem to love. To be able to download or stream without letting it count against your data plan is extremely popular with consumers. I dont have a problem with that. Will you work with the F.C.C. chairman, and how will you get Democrats on board? It may take action by the F.C.C. first in order to get the stars aligned. I think that if the F.C.C. starts moving in the other direction, it might prompt Democrats on the Hill to say, You know what, maybe a legislation solution makes sense. What about broadband privacy rules created in early 2016? Senator Jeff Flake of Arizona and Representative Marsha Blackburn of Tennessee have proposed killing privacy rules through a shortcut legislative process known as the Congressional Review Act .

But I also think we want to get the best possible outcome that doesnt create two sets of privacy rules for broadband and edge web companies, which is what you have today. What can Congress do to help resolve the digital divide? What tools are at your disposal right away? We passed the Mobile Now Act, which was designed to expand spectrum access to get more wireless broadband. We want to get to 5G wireless broadband before anyone else. The Universal Service Fund is another area. How do you want to reform the Universal Service Fund, which allocates $8 billion a year to bring broadband to underserved areas? Weve tried to get broadband-only services covered under U.S.F. because now you have to offer phone and internet.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   Ajit Pai got a lot of criticism for recently stopping nine broadband providers from participating in the Lifeline program , which gives subsidized broadband to low-income individuals. Do you believe in Lifeline, and what do you think of his actions? Like any government program, it ought to be run efficiently. There have been issues of it in the past in regards to abuse and waste. As for these nine providers, they were basically approved right before transition. What hes done is put them on a pending status. Youve been an advocate of driverless cars. How are you going to get driverless cars on the road faster? Autonomous vehicles have enormous potential to save lives. There are barriers that make it difficult not just for testing, but for developing these technologies. Some are simple, like requiring that in every vehicle there be a human steering wheel and a human accelerator. Were going to look at where are some of the barriers to these technologies that are standing in the way.   Follow Cecilia Kang on Twitter @ceciliakang .

Credit Chris Graythen/Getty Images     Dale Earnhardt Jr. found himself in the back seat of a black S.U.V. on the streets of Manhattan on Tuesday morning, a gracious passenger. He was glad someone else had to deal with the noisy taxis and the antsy drivers who used their horns as if they got paid by the honk. On Sunday afternoon, Earnhardt, 42, will begin his 18th full season at Nascar s top level by driving in the Daytona 500, stock-car racings premier race. But this, he said, will be a somewhat different Dale Earnhardt Jr. than has driven before. He was married on New Years Eve to his longtime girlfriend, Amy Reimann, and he is also returning from a serious concussion that sidelined him since July. I do feel like this is a new chapter, for whatever reason, Earnhardt said. I dont have a vision for whats going to happen. I dont know how to explain it, but it feels like a new me.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   It is believed that Earnhardt sustained the concussion  his second in four years  in an accident during a June race in Brooklyn, Mich. He drove in three more races, but then did not return to the track for the rest of the 2016 season, missing 18 races in all. Earnhardt was medically cleared to resume racing on Dec. 8.  Continue reading the main story         Advertisement   Continue reading the main story       Earnhardt, the son of Dale Earnhardt Sr., the seven-time Nascar champion who died at the 2001 Daytona 500, has won the series most popular driver award 14 straight times, largely because of his talent, bloodlines and demeanor, seemingly quick-witted and fun-loving. Success came at a cost, he said.  Photo        Earnhardts No. 88 drove through Turn 4 last weekend during qualifying for the Daytona 500 in Daytona Beach, Fla.   Credit Phelan M. Ebenhack/Associated Press    I feel like I am maybe a little less stressed out, a little less hassled, I guess, by day-to-day living now, he said. I guess I was wound up, wound pretty tight. I dont know if its because Ive been out of the car for so long that Ive had this inadvertent vacation, I guess you could say, that it got my batteries really, really recharged. He stopped himself suddenly and added: Only thing is, does it go away? Do I hang on to this feeling of All right, man? I know Ill get competitive when I get in the car. Itll be hard not to get short with my patience. Thats the biggest thing  just keeping patient. But I feel more calm and comfortable and not so wired up and strung out. Earnhardt has 26 victories in his 595-race career at the top level of stock-car racing, which is being called the Monster Energy Nascar Cup Series for the first time this year. But he has not won a series championship. Claiming one is certainly a driving force for him. But he has other priorities. He has a much deeper appreciation of the sport and its heritage than when he made his Nascar debut, in 1999, in a car owned by his father. He said he wanted the sport to be viable after he is done driving  though he has no idea when that will be. I used to have an agenda: I wanted to do whatever made my car go faster, he said. Im over that, knowing Im on the back side of my career. When Im done driving, I want the sport to be healthy. Im done taking and taking. Im ready to give, give. I try to think of whats the best thing for the sport instead of the best thing for the driver. Acknowledging that Nascar has encountered a recent dip in racetrack attendance and television ratings, Earnhardt, like others, believes the sport would benefit from an influx of new, and young, fans. One way to draw attention and keep it, he said, might be to tweak the rules, as Nascar has done this year by awarding points to leaders after designated stages of races.

I worried a ton about peoples perception about what my problem was. I didnt want any guesses out there. Thats the reason I was so transparent. I was worried about, Is it O.K. Im this transparent? But I couldnt think of any reason it could blow up in my face. The only thing that was bad about it, I guess, is that anytime anybody doesnt agree with you, they hit you with, You hit your head, so you dont know what youre talking about.  He smiled. Although he has continued to emphasize that concussion symptoms can differ from one person to another, he knew his Twitter feed, podcast and news conferences could provide more information about concussions. He is fine with becoming a case study. When I got my first concussion, in 1998, it was like, Wow. I feel dizzy, ha ha. I think Ill go home and lay on the couch, he said. It was almost like I was braggadocios about it: Man, Im tough. I hit my head on the car. Its scary now, knowing everything we know. Theres still a ton to learn. Were going through such a transition how we talk about concussions, how we treat concussions. Its very interesting to me. Very educational. Just last week, Nascar announced an update to its concussion protocol . The protocol now requires doctors at every venue to use the same concussion test, expands when drivers must visit the infield care center after an accident and increases the use of on-site neurological consultants. After driving 600 to 800 laps after he was cleared medically, Earnhardt said he felt comfortable in a racecar now and was eager to see how he would do on Sunday. His career hung in the balance for a while last summer, so he is grateful for another chance to race. When youre young and naive, youre doing it for certain reasons, but when you get older and understand your life and what you want to be doing down the road, your priorities all change, he said. If it was not fun, I wouldnt be doing it. Ive done well with my finances. I dont need to be racing for money. I dont know what we get paid for each race. I dont know what the winner gets for the Daytona 500  no idea. Its just a great job. Its better than any other job I can think of right now.

Credit Morgan Rachel Levy for The New York Times        Weekend trips to cities like Boston, Chicago or San Francisco rarely require a rental car to get around, given their extensive public transportation systems. But more unexpected locales are joining the car-optional list as new and expanding rapid transit options take root across the country. Many major transit systems, like those in New York, predate the ubiquity of cars and serve densely populated urban areas. Now, younger and less dense cities, like Denver , are adding trains or streetcars. Even places most closely associated with cars, like Detroit and Los Angeles , are remaking transit networks once ripped out to make way for Fords, Chevys and Chryslers. Its interesting to see how the West in particular is growing and expanding public transportation, said Virginia Miller, a spokeswoman for the American Public Transportation Association . The nonprofit group reported that 69 percent of public transportation initiatives on ballots nationwide in the November 2016 elections were approved, for a total of about $170 billion in transit projects.

Continue reading the main story         Advertisement   Continue reading the main story       Denver Downtown Denver is 23 miles from Denver International Airport, a distance now covered by the new University of Colorado A Line , which opened last spring, in 37 minutes. The $9 fare acts as a day pass for limitless rides on a rapidly expanding network of light and commuter rail. The new R Line, which is scheduled to open this month, will add 10.5 miles to the regional system that has more than doubled to about 98 miles. The terminus of the airport train, the newly refurbished Union Station , has trendy restaurants, bars and shops as well as its own stylish lodging, the Crawford Hotel . The station is an anchor in the historic LoDo (Lower Downtown) district, where attractions like the Museum of Contemporary Art Denver and Coors Field are within walking distance. In addition, the bike-share program Denver B-cycle operates from 88 locations and offers a good way to reach neighborhoods like RiNo, or River North, home to many breweries and restaurants, or Cherry Creek for shopping. Theres even a new electric three-wheel vehicle service, eTuk , that offers city and brewery tours. And you can take a day trip without renting wheels, via the new Flatiron Flyer rapid transit bus, which offers service from Denver to Boulder in under an hour. Amtraks Winter Park Express runs from Union Station to the ski slopes of Winter Park on weekends through March 26.

Credit Kevin Miyazaki for The New York Times    Detroit The Motor City once had a vital streetcar system, including a track that ran down its main corridor, Woodward Avenue. In April, some 60 years after the old lines were eradicated to make way for cars, the new QLine will restore streetcar service to downtown over a 3.3-mile route. You cant underestimate the symbolic importance of unveiling mass transit in a city like Detroit, which was built on cars, said Amy S. Eckert, a freelance writer and the author of 100 Things to Do in Detroit Before You Die. The streetcar, of course, is limited relative to the footprint of Detroit, and taxis or shuttles, including a service called Skoot that offers van transportation for $20 a person, are still the most common way to get downtown from the airport.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   But the project has sparked a building boom as residences, restaurants and shops have moved in along the corridor. Visitors will be able to shuttle along the route for about $1.50 a ride from near the Detroit River downtown to the nearby baseball and football stadiums (professional hockey and basketball facilities are being built and are expected to open this fall). The route also passes through the cultural Midtown district, home to the Detroit Institute of Arts and other museums. Hotels along the streetcar route include the recently opened Aloft Detroit at the David Whitney . Come April, I dont think youll miss having a car, provided you stay in and around Woodward Avenue, and thats where most of the renaissance is anyway, Ms. Eckert said. Some areas worth exploring, like the vibrant Corktown neighborhood or Belle Isle Park, are some distance from the streetcar route. For those, there are Uber, Lyft and, also coming in spring, Detroit Bike Share with 43 stations.

Credit Monica Almeida/The New York Times    Los Angeles No American city is more synonymous with congestion  as captured in the opening scene of La La Land  than Los Angeles. But alongside and under those clogged highways, the citys Metro Rail has built 105 miles of subway or light rail in Los Angeles County since 1990. Two extensions opened in 2016 now reach west to beachfront Santa Monica and extend from Pasadena east to Azusa at the base of the San Gabriel Mountains. With the growth of the public transit system, the Los Angeles Tourism & Convention Board has run a Car Free L.A. campaign for nearly five years. It offers 15 sightseeing guides on its website ranging from downtowns Museum Row, home to the Los Angeles County Museum of Art and the La Brea Tar Pits Museum, to the restaurants of Koreatown.

If its your first trip to L.A., you can hit the tourist spots on the Metro, but youll kind of miss out on some of the hidden charms that make the city such a unique place, said Michael Juliano, an associate editor at Time Out Los Angeles. For those, he suggests making like a local and using a rideshare service. And youll still need a bus, taxi or rideshare to get from the airport into the city.

To avoid it, take the free people mover PHX Sky Train from the terminals to the Valley Metro Light Rail .

She also owns an art gallery in the Roosevelt Row Arts District , walking distance from the train. Walkability has encouraged an urban core that wasnt there before, she said. An unlimited day pass is $4, and other stops on the line reach the Phoenix Art Museum , the Chase Field baseball stadium and Symphony Hall. The new Found:Re Phoenix hotel recently opened along the rail line with an art-filled lobby bar and restaurant. It is within walking distance of the galleries along Roosevelt and popular restaurants like Matts Big Breakfast. Heat in the summer in Phoenix is like snow in the north, often a deterrent to walking. But the stations feature shade barriers and, as locals point out, can be closer to your destination than a parking lot.

Some current and former Uber employees describe a largely unrestrained workplace culture.   Credit Krisztian Bocsi/Bloomberg     SAN FRANCISCO  When new employees join Uber, they are asked to subscribe to 14 core company values, including making bold bets, being obsessed with the customer, and always be hustlin. The ride-hailing service particularly emphasizes meritocracy, the idea that the best and brightest will rise to the top based on their efforts, even if it means stepping on toes to get there. Those values have helped propel Uber to one of Silicon Valleys biggest success stories. The company is valued at close to $70 billion by private investors and now operates in more than 70 countries. Yet the focus on pushing for the best result has also fueled what current and former Uber employees describe as a Hobbesian environment at the company, in which workers are sometimes pitted against one another and where a blind eye is turned to infractions from top performers. Interviews with more than 30 current and former Uber employees, as well as reviews of internal emails, chat logs and tape-recorded meetings, paint a picture of an often unrestrained workplace culture. Among the most egregious accusations from employees, who either witnessed or were subject to incidents and who asked to remain anonymous because of confidentiality agreements and fear of retaliation: One Uber manager groped female co-workers breasts at a company retreat in Las Vegas. A director shouted a homophobic slur at a subordinate during a heated confrontation in a meeting. Another manager threatened to beat an underperforming employees head in with a baseball bat.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   Until this week, this culture was only whispered about in Silicon Valley. Then on Sunday, Susan Fowler, an engineer who left Uber in December, published a blog post about her time at the company. She detailed a history of discrimination and sexual harassment by her managers, which she said was shrugged off by Ubers human resources department. Ms. Fowler said the culture was stoked  and even fostered  by those at the top of the company.  Continue reading the main story         Advertisement   Continue reading the main story       It seemed like every manager was fighting their peers and attempting to undermine their direct supervisor so that they could have their direct supervisors job, Ms. Fowler wrote. No attempts were made by these managers to hide what they were doing: They boasted about it in meetings, told their direct reports about it, and the like.  Photo        Travis Kalanick, Ubers chief executive, has taken several steps since a former employees accusations of discrimination and sexual harassment by managers.   Credit Marlene Awaad/Bloomberg    Her revelations have spurred hand-wringing over how unfriendly Silicon Valley workplaces can be to women and provoked an internal crisis at Uber. The companys chief executive, Travis Kalanick, has opened an internal investigation into the accusations and has brought in the board member Arianna Huffington and the former attorney general Eric H. Holder Jr. to look into harassment issues and the human resources department. To contain the fallout, Mr. Kalanick also began more disclosure. On Monday, he said that 15.1 percent of Ubers engineering, product management and scientist roles were filled by women, and that those numbers had not changed substantively over the past year. Mr. Kalanick also held a 90-minute all-hands meeting on Tuesday , during which he and other executives were besieged with dozens of questions and pleas from employees who were aghast at  or strongly identified with  Ms. Fowlers story and demanded change. In what was described by five attendees as an emotional moment, and according to a video of the meeting reviewed by The New York Times, Mr. Kalanick apologized to employees for leading the company and the culture to this point. What I can promise you is that I will get better every day, he said. I can tell you that I am authentically and fully dedicated to getting to the bottom of this. Some Uber employees said Mr. Kalanicks speedy efforts were positive. I am pleased with how quickly Travis has responded to this, Aimee Lucido, an Uber software engineer, wrote in a blog post . We are better situated to handle this sort of problem than we have ever been in the past. As chief executive, Mr. Kalanick has long set the tone for Uber. Under him, Uber has taken a pugnacious approach to business, flouting local laws and criticizing competitors in a race to expand as quickly as possible. Mr. Kalanick, 40, has made pointed displays of ego: In a GQ article in 2014 , he referred to Uber as Boob-er because of how the company helped him attract women.          OPEN Document    Document: Internal Memo From Uber's Chief, Travis Kalanick    That tone has been echoed in Ubers workplace. At least two former Uber workers said they had notified Thuan Pham, the companys chief technical officer, of workplace harassment at the hands of managers and colleagues in 2016. One also emailed Mr. Kalanick.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   Uber also faces at least three lawsuits in at least two countries from former employees alleging sexual harassment or verbal abuse at the hands of managers, according to legal documents reviewed by The Times. Other current and former employees said they were considering legal action against the company. Liane Hornsey, Ubers chief human resources officer, said in a statement, We are totally committed to healing wounds of the past and building a better workplace culture for everyone.

Mr. Kalanick also started putting into place what eventually became Ubers 14 core values, inspired by the leadership principles at one of the biggest public tech companies, Amazon . To grow quickly, Uber kept its structure decentralized, emphasizing autonomy among regional offices. General managers are encouraged to be themselves, another of Ubers core values, and are empowered to make decisions without intense supervision from the companys San Francisco headquarters. The top priority: Achieve growth and revenue targets. While Uber is now the dominant ride-hailing company in the United States, and is rapidly growing in South America, India and other countries, its explosive growth has come at a cost internally. As Uber hired more employees, its internal politics became more convoluted. Getting ahead, employees said, often involved undermining departmental leaders or colleagues.  Photo        Arianna Huffington, an Uber board member, was brought in to look into harassment issues and the human resources department.   Credit Andrew Burton/Getty Images    Workers like Ms. Fowler who went to human resources with their problems said they were often left stranded. She and a half-dozen others said human resources often made excuses for top performers because of their ability to improve the health of the business. Occasionally, problematic managers who were the subject of numerous complaints were shuffled around different regions; firings were less common. One group appeared immune to internal scrutiny, the current and former employees said. Members of the group, called the A-Team and composed of executives who were personally close to Mr. Kalanick, were shielded from much accountability over their actions. One member of the A-Team was Emil Michael, senior vice president for business, who was caught up in a public scandal over comments he made in 2014 about digging into the private lives of journalists who opposed the company. Mr. Kalanick defended Mr. Michael, saying he believed Mr. Michael could learn from his mistakes.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   Ubers aggressive workplace culture spilled out at a global all-hands meeting in late 2015 in Las Vegas, where the company hired Beyonce to perform at the rooftop bar of the Palms Hotel. Between bouts of drinking and gambling, Uber employees used cocaine in the bathrooms at private parties, said three attendees, and a manager groped several female employees. (The manager was terminated within 12 hours.) One employee hijacked a private shuttle bus, filled it with friends and took it for a joy ride, the attendees said. At the Las Vegas outing, Mr. Kalanick also held a companywide lecture reviewing Ubers 14 core values, the attendees said. During the lecture, Mr. Kalanick pulled onstage employees who he believed exemplified each of the values. One of those was Mr. Michael. Since Ms. Fowlers blog post, several Uber employees have said they are considering leaving the company. Some are waiting until their equity compensation from Uber, which is restricted stock units, is vested. Others said they had started sending resumes to competitors.   Still other employees said they were hopeful that Uber could change. Mr. Kalanick has promised to deliver a diversity report to better detail the number of women and minorities who work at Uber, and the company is holding listening sessions with employees. At the Tuesday all-hands meeting, Ms. Huffington, the Uber board member, also vowed that the company would make another change. According to attendees and video of the meeting, Ms. Huffington said there would no longer be hiring of brilliant jerks.

An engineer said that the human resources department ignored those claims even after she had reported them.   Credit Marlene Awaad/Bloomberg     The chief executive of Uber on Sunday opened an internal investigation into claims of sexual harassment made by a former engineer at the company. The engineer, Susan Fowler, said that she was sexually harassed by her direct supervisor during her time at Uber and that after she reported those claims to the human resources department, they were ignored. She gave her account in a lengthy post on her personal blog on Sunday. It was clear that he was trying to get me to have sex with him, and it was so clearly out of line that I immediately took screenshots of these chat messages and reported him to HR, Ms. Fowler wrote. Upper management told me that he was a high performer (i.e. had stellar performance reviews from his superiors) and they wouldnt feel comfortable punishing him for what was probably just an innocent mistake on his part. Ms. Fowler left Uber in December and this year joined Stripe, a payments processing start-up. Ms. Fowlers account is another sign of Silicon Valleys struggle with womens issues and diversity in a male-dominated engineering environment. In 2015, the venture capital world was put under the microscope when Ellen Pao, a former partner at Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers, claimed in a lawsuit that she was discriminated against at the blue-chip venture firm because of her gender  a case she lost .

He said he had instructed Liane Hornsey, the companys recently hired chief of human resources, to conduct an urgent investigation into these allegations.

We seek to make Uber a just workplace for everyone, and there can be absolutely no place for this kind of behavior at Uber  and anyone who behaves this way or thinks this is O.K. will be fired. In a Twitter post on Sunday , Arianna Huffington, the business mogul and a board member at Uber, solicited feedback from employees and said she would work with Ms. Hornsey to support the investigation. Messages sent to Ms. Fowler over email and Twitter were not immediately answered on Sunday. Uber recently faced a backlash when Mr. Kalanick agreed to join President Trumps economic advisory council. The matter reached a fever pitch around the time of Mr. Trumps travel ban against seven predominantly Muslim countries, and hundreds of thousands of people deleted their Uber accounts from their phones in protest of the company. After the outcry, Mr. Kalanick eventually stepped down from Mr. Trumps council .

They can see how many times you went to the grocery store or the health clinic. Auto loans to Americans with poor credit have been booming, and many finance companies, credit unions and auto dealers are using technologies to track the location of borrowers vehicles in case they need to repossess them. Such surveillance, lenders say, allows them to extend loans to more low- income Americans, knowing that they can easily locate the car. Lenders are also installing devices that enable them to remotely disable a cars ignition after a borrower misses a payment. Now, federal regulators are investigating whether these devices unfairly violate a borrowers privacy.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   The auto lender Credit Acceptance Corporation said this month in a securities filing that it had received a civil investigative demand from the Federal Trade Commission asking for its policies, practices and procedures related to so-called GPS starter interrupter devices, which are used to disable an ignition.  Continue reading the main story         Advertisement   Continue reading the main story       Industry lawyers say the action is part of a broader inquiry by the agency into tracking technologies used in the subprime auto lending market. An agency spokesman declined to comment on the investigative demand. Finding out where people are located can reveal a lot about what people are doing in their lives, said Lauren Smith, policy counsel at the Future of Privacy Forum, a think tank focused on privacy issues. Location data is very sensitive. If the federal agency determines that the devices are being used unfairly or deceptively, it could force companies to stop the behavior and devise procedures and monitoring to ensure that customer privacy is better protected. The regulatory scrutiny over the GPS starter interrupter devices comes as cracks are starting to appear in the red-hot auto loan market. The percentage of auto loans that were at least 90 days delinquent increased to 3.8 percent in the fourth quarter from 3.6 percent in the third quarter, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York In determining whether to take action, the Federal Trade Commission must first decide whether the benefit to consumers  in this case the availability of auto loans  outweighs the privacy problems. The auto finance industry says the benefits of the devices are clear. Without them, many low-income Americans would not be able to buy cars that they need to get to work. So far, there is no widespread evidence that lenders are misusing information they track from a vehicles whereabouts.

This is a registered vehicle, Mr. Tracey said. It has a license plate, and you can see where it is traveling. You are driving something that isnt private anywhere.

The GPS capabilities, they say, are intended to help lenders locate a car once a borrower goes into default, not to be used simply as a surveillance tool. As an added protection, some manufacturers said, they built their devices so that the GPS is not activated until a borrower defaults. But privacy experts and many borrowers who have the devices in their cars say there is great potential for abuse, particularly because the devices fall outside traditional state and federal lending laws. Some find it unsettling that the technology gives lenders so much control over borrowers  particularly poor borrowers, who typically have no choice but to accept the device if they want a loan to buy a car. They dont need to know what we are doing  when we go out to eat, when we go on vacation, said Elias Sanchez, a forklift operator in Austin, Tex. We want our privacy. His auto dealer didnt tell him that a GPS tracking device had been installed in his 2005 Ford S.U.V., he said. A 2014 investigation by The New York Times highlighted the tracking technology. In a front-page article , the head of collections at a Louisiana credit union said he could monitor a vehicles whereabouts on his smartphone and once disabled a borrowers ignition while shopping at a Walmart. A mother in Las Vegas described in the article how she had been unable to get her feverish child to a hospital because her car had been shut off for a missed payment. Other borrowers have complained in interviews of being stranded, marooned in dangerous neighborhoods and cut off from their cars when they needed it the most. In Nevada, one woman testified to the Legislature that her car had been shut down on a freeway.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   Some state lawmakers have taken note. The New Jersey Legislature is working to revise a bill, vetoed this month by Gov. Chris Christie, that would strengthen the disclosure requirements and add consumer protections to the devices. Under the bill, consumers would get written disclosures that a device had been installed in their car and at least 72 hours notice before the ignition was disabled. The Federal Trade Commission has brought several regulatory actions against businesses in recent years over privacy violations. In 2013, the agency acted against a group of rent-to-own companies and a software firm for spying on customers who rented laptop computers. The agency said the companies had used software to take screen shots of confidential and personal information, log customers keystrokes and take screen shots of people in their homes. The companies were prohibited from secretly collecting this data from their customers. Automobiles, the federal agency has said, are part of the ballooning internet of things that is constantly transmitting potentially sensitive data across the web. The agency had been urging auto manufacturers among many other industries to come up with new safeguards for personal data . Privacy is expected to remain a focus of the Federal Trade Commission even as several new members are due to be appointed during the Trump administration. Privacy issues seem to garner bipartisan support, said Christopher Kukla, executive vice president at the Center for Responsible Lending, a research and advocacy group focused on consumer finance. We will have to see if that is something they will be able to move forward on.

How was this number arrived at? Basically, they worked backwards, assuming the growth they needed to make their budget numbers add up. Credibility!  But the purpose of this post is mainly to explain why such a number is implausible  not impossible, but not something that should be anyones central forecast.  The claimed returns to Trumpnomics are close to the highest growth rates weve seen under any modern administration. Real GDP grew 3.4 percent annually under Reagan; it grew 3.7 percent annually under Clinton (shhh  dont tell conservatives.) But there are fundamental reasons to believe that such growth is unlikely to happen now.  First, demography: Reagan took office with baby boomers  and women  still entering the work force; these days baby boomers are leaving. Heres UN data on the 5-year growth rate of the population aged 20-64, a rough proxy for those likely to seek work:  Photo Credit   Just on demography alone, then, youd expect growth to be around a percentage point lower than it was under Reagan.  Furthermore, while Trump did not, in fact, inherit a mess, both Reagan and Clinton did  in the narrow sense that both came into office amid depressed economies, with unemployment above 7 percent:  Photo Credit   This meant a substantial amount of slack to be taken up when the economy returned to full employment. Rough calculation: 2 points of excess unemployment means 4 percent output gap under Okuns Law, which means 0.5 percentage points of extra growth over an 8-year period.  So even if you (wrongly) give Reagan policies credit for the business cycle recovery after 1982, and believe (wrongly) that Trumponomics is going to do wonderful things for incentives a la Reagan, you should still be expecting growth of 2 percent or under.  Now, maybe something awesome will happen: either driverless or flying cars will transform everything, whatever. But you shouldnt be counting on it.             What's Next    Loading...

Credit J. Scott Applewhite/Associated Press By  Paul Krugman Feb. 20, 2017 According to press reports , the Trump administration is basing its budget projections on the assumption that the U.S. economy will grow very rapidly over the next decade  in fact, almost twice as fast as independent institutions like the Congressional Budget Office and the Federal Reserve expect. There is, as far as we can tell, no serious analysis behind this optimism; instead, the number was plugged in to make the fiscal outlook appear better. I guess this was only to be expected from a man who keeps insisting that crime, which is actually near record lows, is at a record high, that millions of illegal ballots were responsible for his popular vote loss, and so on: In Trumpworld, numbers are what you want them to be, and anything else is fake news. But the truth is that unwarranted arrogance about economics isnt Trump-specific. On the contrary, its the modern Republican norm. And the question is why. Before I get there, a word about why extreme growth optimism is unwarranted. The Trump team is apparently projecting growth at between 3 and 3.5 percent for a decade. This wouldnt be unprecedented: the U.S. economy grew at a 3.4 percent rate during the Reagan years, 3.7 percent under Bill Clinton. But a repeat performance is unlikely . For one thing, in the Reagan years baby boomers were still entering the work force. Now theyre on their way out, and the rise in the working-age population has slowed to a crawl. This demographic shift alone should, other things being equal, subtract around a percentage point from U.S. growth. Furthermore, both Reagan and Clinton inherited depressed economies, with unemployment well over 7 percent. This meant that there was a lot of economic slack, allowing rapid growth as the unemployed went back to work. Today, by contrast, unemployment is under 5 percent, and other indicators suggest an economy close to full employment. This leaves much less scope for rapid growth. The only way we could have a growth miracle now would be a huge takeoff in productivity  output per worker-hour. This could, of course, happen: maybe driverless flying cars will arrive en masse. But its hardly something one should assume for a baseline projection. And its certainly not something one should count on as a result of conservative economic policies. Which brings me to the strange arrogance of the economic right. As I said, belief that tax cuts and deregulation will reliably produce awesome growth isnt unique to the Trump-Putin administration. We heard the same thing from Jeb Bush (who?); we hear it from congressional Republicans like Paul Ryan. The question is why. After all, there is nothing  nothing at all  in the historical record to justify this arrogance. Yes, Reagan presided over pretty fast growth. But Bill Clinton, who raised taxes on the rich, amid confident predictions from the right that this would cause an economic disaster, presided over even faster growth. President Obama presided over much more rapid private-sector job growth than George W. Bush, even if you leave out the 2008 collapse. Furthermore, two Obama policies that the right totally hated  the 2013 hike in tax rates on the rich, and the 2014 implementation of the Affordable Care Act  produced no slowdown at all in job creation. Meanwhile, the growing polarization of American politics has given us what amount to economic policy experiments at the state level. Kansas, dominated by conservative true believers, implemented sharp tax cuts with the promise that these cuts would jump-start rapid growth; they didnt, and caused a budget crisis instead. Last week Kansas legislators threw in the towel and passed a big tax hike . At the same time Kansas was turning hard right, Californias newly dominant Democratic majority raised taxes. Conservatives declared it economic suicide  but the state is in fact doing fine . The evidence, then, is totally at odds with claims that tax-cutting and deregulation are economic wonder drugs. So why does a whole political party continue to insist that they are the answer to all problems? It would be nice to pretend that were still having a serious, honest discussion here, but we arent. At this point we have to get real and talk about whose interests are being served. Never mind whether slashing taxes on billionaires while giving scammers and polluters the freedom to scam and pollute is good for the economy as a whole; its clearly good for billionaires, scammers, and polluters. Campaign finance being what it is, this creates a clear incentive for politicians to keep espousing a failed doctrine, for think tanks to keep inventing new excuses for that doctrine, and more. And on such matters Donald Trump is really no worse than the rest of his party. Unfortunately, hes also no better.
