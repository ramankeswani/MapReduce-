What clients dont want to pay for is any routine work. Credit Jason Henry for The New York Times April 3, 2017 To the Editor: Re  I, Robot, Esq.? Not Just Yet  (Business Day, March 20): It shouldnt come as a surprise that the unrelenting march of technology  specifically, artificial intelligence, or A.I.  would eventually affect the legal market and other white-collar professions. But what is different now from, say, the introduction of automobiles at the expense of horse-driven cabs is the sheer magnitude of all those affected by A.I. Consider the millions of transportation-related jobs that will be disrupted by the rapidly approaching introduction of self-driving cars and trucks. There arent too many options. While some have proposed a stopgap method of taxing employers who replace human workers with robots, better solutions include providing training and re-education for those who can move on to other jobs, and a universal basic income for those who cant. For the lawyers in particular, incoming law students must demand that their education provide them with the tools to adapt before they end up with hundreds of thousands of dollars in student debt and a disappearing profession.

Credit Marcio Jose Sanchez/Associated Press     The relationship may have faded long ago, but the intimate images you shared have not. If youre lucky, your ex deleted them. If youre not, the photos have sprouted up online. Victims of such nonconsensual posts, often referred to as revenge porn, now have some help in preventing their spread: On Wednesday, Facebook announced new artificial intelligence tools designed to keep such content, once flagged, off its site for good. Its wrong, its hurtful, and if you report it to us, we will now use A.I. and image recognition to prevent it from being shared across all of our platforms, Mark Zuckerberg , the social networks founder and chief executive, said in a Facebook post . The tools announced on Wednesday are intended to address a uniquely modern and pernicious form of harassment, often but not exclusively aimed at women, that has attracted increasing attention.

The photo-matching technology will then work to identify and thwart the future posting of similar images, not only on Facebook, but also to its instant messaging service and to Instagram . The company also published a guide on reporting and removing such intimate images, and said that it had teamed up with safety organizations such as the Cyber Civil Rights Initiative , which operates a hotline for victims of nonconsensual pornography.

The group is among the bands and celebrities using chatbots to communicate with fans through Facebook Messenger.   Credit Theo Wargo/Getty Images     In January, Christina Ausset, a 24-year-old Maroon 5 fan in France, spotted an enticing Twitter post from another of the bands followers: I just had a conversation with Maroon 5! Awesome! The interaction, it turned out, had been conducted on Facebook Messenger with Maroon 5s chatbot  an automated program designed to respond to basic commands. Not exactly a conversation with Adam Levine, Ms. Ausset noted, but it didnt matter. She now happily talks to the bot, too. Having Maroon 5 on Messenger, she wrote in an email, makes you feel really close to your favorite artists! For celebrities who already use Twitter, Instagram and Snapchat to lend a personal touch to their interactions with fans, the next frontier of social media is a deliberately impersonal one: chatbots, a low-level form of artificial intelligence that can be harnessed to send news updates, push promotional content and even test new material.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   In the music world, bot is often a dirty word, conjuring up the tools used by high-tech ticket scalpers. Yet 50 Cent, Aerosmith, Snoop Dogg and Kiss have all deputized chatbots as their automatic, ever-alert greeters on Facebook Messenger, handling the flood of inquiries that would overwhelm any human.  Continue reading the main story         Advertisement   Continue reading the main story       When someone connects to Maroon 5 on Messenger, a text bubble pops up: Hi, it says, Im the Maroon 5 bot. Want to be the first to know when we release new music? A series of questions with multiple-choice answers follows, leading the fan down a path lined with emojis and video clips; social media links then point other fans back to the bot. It is a purposely simple interaction, created through technology developed by a start-up named Octane AI. Yet even in their programmed responses, chatbots can convey human personality, said Christina Milian, a singer and actress who has been among the earliest proponents of the technology, and helped found Persona Technologies, an Octane competitor. I feel like its personal, Ms. Milian said of her own chatbot. Its definitely in my words. Its how I talk. My fans know how I talk. Not all celebrity bots are quite up to the level of verbal verisimilitude, however. Aerosmiths, for example, responds to virtually every inquiry with Rock on.  Photo        Matt Schlicht, left, and Ben Parr founded Octane AI, which lets anyone use its technology to build a bot.   Credit Drew Anthony Smith for The New York Times    But Ms. Milian said her bots intelligence surprised even her. When Im communicating with my own chatbot, she said, sometimes I see something and Im like, Oh, thats so me! The chatbots may also offer a glimpse of the music industrys future, which is already beginning to involve virtual-reality concerts, playlist algorithms and virtual assistants like Amazons Alexa, said Cortney Harding, a consultant to music technology companies and the author of How Well Listen Next: The Future of Music From Streaming to Virtual Reality. As A.I. develops, everything is going to go into a mixed-reality world, Ms. Harding said, where you could dial up a hologram of your favorite pop star and have real conversations with the artificially intelligent version of that person.

Matt Schlicht, Octane AIs chief executive, said that with more than a billion users, Messenger  the chat app connected to Facebook  was too large for celebrities to ignore. And once they are paying attention, his companys bots can help them make efficient use of it. Right now people are looking at bots and saying, I dont know, maybe theyre cool, maybe not, Mr. Schlicht said. But based on the data were seeing, its not crazy to think that a year from now its going to be their No. 1 distribution channel. Chatbots have become a common part of online interaction for major consumer companies; Dominos, for example, lets customers use one to order a pizza. They have quickly spread since April of last year, when Facebook made it possible for developers to build bots on Messenger.

Chris Mortimer, the head of digital marketing at Interscope, said Messenger was now a critical way for his artists to reach their fans. Right now, a Facebook Messenger inbox is what an email inbox was before the spammers got to it, he said.  Photo        Mr. Schlicht demonstrated how a user could interact with a chatbot for the actress Lindsay Lohan.   Credit Drew Anthony Smith for The New York Times    Octane AIs clients say response rates to its chats are extraordinarily high. According to the company, when its bots send a new notification, 50 to 75 percent of its subscribers open the message and click a link within 10 minutes. Bots have become popular for musicians even though they have been slow to catch on over all; at a conference in September, a Facebook executive called the technology  overhyped , and said that early examples were unimpressive. Still, Ms. Milian said her Messenger account had attracted two million people since she introduced her bot in October. Maroon 5 also demonstrated its value for commercial research. In February, a day before the band released its single Cold, it sent a 10-second clip of the song to its chatbot followers. Within 24 hours, fans sent 100,000 messages to the bot, and shared the clip widely on social media. You can get pretty strong sentiment analysis in a snap, said Ben Parr, Octane AIs chief marketing officer.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   Chatbots high engagement rates may be helped by their novelty. But as they spread, they will have to be reconciled with the sour perception of bots among the general public, which has been building for years because of the use of bots in fake social-media accounts and, especially, ticketing. Bots have become such a scourge in the global scalping market that last year President Barack Obama signed a federal bill outlawing their use in buying event tickets. I hate the word bot, said Josh Bocanegra, Personas chief executive, who founded the company with Ms. Milian. Its never been associated with anything positive. Mr. Bocanegra entered the business last year, after making a Selena Gomez bot to entertain his daughter . Persona creates custom chatbots for clients including Snoop Dogg and one for the 50 Shades Darker character Christian Grey , which tells fans that if it cannot trust them, Ill have no choice but to spank you. Bocanegra said a basic bot could be ordered for $2,500 plus maintenance charges. Octane AI, which lets anyone use its technology to build a bot, does not charge for its services. The company is supported by $1.6 million from investors including the venture capital firm General Catalyst, and says it will introduce revenue-generating features soon. So far, the bots ability to create interactions with pop stars  even if those interactions are programmed in computer code  has been enough to intrigue fans. Sue Winett, a Maroon 5 fan in the Los Angeles area, proudly notes that at age 61 she is far older than the average admirer of the band. But she said that her love of the band had led her to all forms of social media  her Twitter handle is @AdoreAdamLevine , after the bands lead singer  and that aside from a few kinks in the programming, she was enjoying the bands chatbot. I know its a robot, Ms. Winett said. Does it creep me out that its a robot? No.   A version of this article appears in print on April 4, 2017, on Page B1 of the New York edition with the headline: Youre a Bot? Rock On.

He traveled to Russia that month to deliver a speech to the New Economic School, a university in Moscow.   Credit Pavel Golovkin/Associated Press     Russian intelligence operatives tried in 2013 to recruit an American businessman and eventual foreign policy adviser to the Trump campaign who is now part of the F.B.I. investigation into Russias interference into the American election, according to federal court documents and a statement issued by the businessman. The businessman, Carter Page , met with one of three Russians who were eventually charged with being undeclared officers with Russias foreign intelligence service, known as the S.V.R. The F.B.I. interviewed Mr. Page in 2013 as part of an investigation into the spy ring, but decided that he had not known the man was a spy, and the bureau never accused Mr. Page of wrongdoing. The court documents say that Mr. Page, who founded an investment company in New York called Global Energy Capital, provided documents about the energy business to one of the Russians, Victor Podobnyy, thinking he was a businessman who could help with brokering deals in Russia. In fact, Mr. Podobnyy was an S.V.R. officer posing as an attache at the Russian mission to the United Nations.

Mr. Pages contact with the Russian spy was first reported on Monday by BuzzFeed News .          OPEN Document    Document: U.S. Accuses 3 Russians of Spying    The disclosure is the latest to shed light on Mr. Pages extensive contacts with Russian businessmen and government officials. A former Moscow-based investment banker for Merrill Lynch, Mr. Page joined the Trump campaign last year and traveled to Russia in July to deliver a speech to the New Economic School, a Moscow university.  Continue reading the main story         Advertisement   Continue reading the main story       The trip caught the attention of United States intelligence agencies. Later that month, the F.B.I. opened a counterintelligence investigation into Russian attempts to influence the presidential election and whether any of Mr. Trumps associates were involved in that effort. American businessmen who visit Russia, even those who are not advising a presidential campaign, are frequently targeted by Russian operatives trying to collect information about the United States. Mr. Page has given few specifics about whom he met with on that trip. In an interview with The New York Times last month, he said he had met with mostly scholars. According to the court documents filed in 2015, the F.B.I. secretly recorded Mr. Podobnyy and another Russian operative named Igor Sporyshev discussing efforts to recruit Mr. Page, who was then working in New York as a consultant. To record their conversations, the F.B.I. inserted a listening device into binders that were passed to the Russian intelligence operatives during an energy conference, according to a former United States intelligence official. The Russians then took the binders into a secure room where they thought they could evade American intelligence eavesdropping attempts. In a transcript of the conversation included in the court documents, Mr. Podobnyy tells his Russian colleague that Mr. Page frequently flies to Moscow and is interested in earning large sums of money. Mr. Page was apparently interested in striking a deal with Gazprom, the Russian state-run oil firm, according to the transcript. Mr. Podobnyy called Mr. Page an idiot but said he was enthusiastic.

The third Russian spy, Evgeny Buryakov, posed as an employee of a Russian bank. Mr. Sporyshev worked as a trade representative of the Russian Federation in New York.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   Mr. Podobnyy promised through his contacts with Russian trade officials to steer contracts to Mr. Page. I will feed him empty promises, he was overheard saying, according to the transcript. In June 2013, the F.B.I. interviewed Mr. Page, who said he had first met Mr. Podobnyy at an energy symposium in New York earlier that year. Mr. Page said that he had exchanged emails with Mr. Podobnyy about the energy business, that they had met in person once to talk about the energy industry, and that he had also given Mr. Podobnyy documents about the energy business. In his emailed statement, Mr. Page said, as I explained to federal authorities prior to the January 2015 filing of this case, I shared basic immaterial information and publicly available research documents with Podobnyy who then served as a junior attache at the Permanent Mission of the Russian Federation to the United Nations. Mr. Page, who at the time was also teaching a course on energy and politics at New York University, said in his statement that he had given the Russian nothing more than a few samples from the far more detailed lectures I was preparing at the time for the students. Though charged, Mr. Podobnyy and Mr. Sporyshev were protected by diplomatic immunity from arrest and prosecution while in the United States, but Mr. Buryakov, who was working under what is known as non-official cover, had entered the United States as a private citizen and did not have diplomatic immunity. Mr. Buryakov was arrested in 2015 and later pleaded guilty to conspiring to act as an unregistered foreign agent. Last year, he was sentenced to 30 months in prison. Evgeny Buryakov, in the guise of being a legitimate banker, gathered intelligence as an agent of the Russian Federation in New York, Preet Bharara, the United States attorney in Manhattan at the time, said in a statement after Mr. Buryakovs sentencing.

Over the years, Google trained computer systems to keep copyrighted content and pornography off its YouTube service. But after seeing ads from Coca-Cola, Procter & Gamble and Wal-Mart appear next to racist, anti-Semitic or terrorist videos, its engineers realized their computer models had a blind spot: They did not understand context. Now teaching computers to understand what humans can readily grasp may be the key to calming fears among big-spending advertisers that their ads have been appearing alongside videos from extremist groups and other offensive messages. Google engineers, product managers and policy wonks are trying to train computers to grasp the nuances of what makes certain videos objectionable. Advertisers may tolerate use of a racial epithet in a hip-hop video, for example, but may be horrified to see it used in a video from a racist skinhead group. That ads bought by well-known companies can occasionally appear next to offensive videos has long been considered a nuisance to YouTubes business. But the issue has gained urgency in recent weeks, as The Times of London and other outlets have written about brands that inadvertently fund extremists through automated advertising  a byproduct of a system in which YouTube shares a portion of ad sales with the creators of the content those ads appear against.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   This glitch in the companys giant, automated process turned into a public-relations nightmare. Companies like AT&T and Johnson & Johnson said they would pull their ads from YouTube, as well as Googles display advertising business, until they could get assurances that such placement would not happen again.  Continue reading the main story         Advertisement   Continue reading the main story       Consumers watch more than a billion hours on YouTube every day, making it the dominant video platform on the internet and an obvious beneficiary as advertising money moves online from television. But the recent problems opened Google to criticism that it was not doing enough to look out for advertisers. It is a significant problem for a multibillion-dollar company that still gets most of its revenue through advertising. We take this as seriously as weve ever taken a problem, Philipp Schindler, Googles chief business officer, said in an interview last week. Weve been in emergency mode. Over the last two weeks, Google has changed what types of videos can carry advertising, barring ads from appearing with hate speech or discriminatory content. In addition, Google is simplifying how advertisers can exclude specific sites, channels and videos across YouTube and Googles display network. It is allowing brands to fine-tune the types of content they want to avoid, such as sexually suggestive or sensational/bizarre videos. It is also putting in more stringent safety standards by default, so an advertiser must choose to place ads next to more provocative content. Google created an expedited way to alert it when ads appear next to offensive content. The Silicon Valley giant is trying to reassure companies like Unilever, the worlds second-largest advertiser, with a portfolio of consumer brands like Dove and Ben & Jerrys. As other brands started fleeing YouTube, Unilever discovered three instances in which its brands appeared on objectionable YouTube channels.  Photo        A Google project is bringing machine-learning techniques to bear on the problem of identifying content on its YouTube service that advertisers might find inappropriate.   Credit Dado Ruvic/Reuters    But Keith Weed, chief marketing officer of Unilever, decided not to withdraw its ads because the number of ads appearing with objectionable content was proportionally small. The average $100,000 YouTube campaign runs across more than 7,000 channels, according to the video analytics firm OpenSlate, and Unilever spends hundreds of millions of dollars on YouTube. Also, Google discovered that the ads in question appeared because of a human error in setting safety levels.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   Mr. Weed said it was in Unilevers best interest to win concessions from Google instead of cutting ties. As part of its new measures, Google agreed to work with outside companies to provide third-party verification about where ads appeared on YouTube. When he broached the idea of independent verification in the past, Mr. Weed said, Google executives acted as though he had suggested the company was not trustworthy. He said the issue was not about trust, but about companies being able to mark their own homework. He said he thought that Google would have agreed eventually, but that the current situation accelerated their plans.

Johnson & Johnson, for example, said it had resumed YouTube advertising in a number of countries. Google said other companies were starting to return. For the most part, Google failed to address the issue adequately before because it did not have to; the instances in which ads appeared next to objectionable content happened infrequently and out of view from the broader public. Google said that for many of its top advertisers, the objectionable videos accounted for fewer than one one-thousandth of a percent of their total ad impressions. To train the computers, Google is applying machine-learning techniques  the underlying technology for many of its biggest breakthroughs, like the self-driving car. It has also brought in large human teams (it declined to say how big) to review the appropriateness of videos that computers flagged as questionable. Essentially, they are training computers to recognize footage of a woman in a sports bra and leggings doing yoga poses in an exercise video safe for advertising and not sexually suggestive content. Similarly, they will mark video of a Hollywood action star waving a gun as acceptable to some advertisers, while flagging a similar image involving an Islamic State gunman as inappropriate. Google used a similar approach in the past to create an automated rating system for videos, similar to movie ratings, based on appropriateness of content for specific audiences. But Google is now trying to solve a different problem. Computers have a much harder time understanding context, and thats why were actually using all of our latest and greatest machine learning abilities now to get a better feel for this, Mr. Schindler said. Armed with human-verified examples of what is safe and what is not, Googles computer systems break down the images of a YouTube video frame by frame, analyzing every image. They also digest what is being said, the videos description from the creator and other signals to detect patterns and identify subtle cues for what makes a video inappropriate.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   The idea is for machines to eventually make the tough calls. In the instances when brands feel that Google failed to flag an inappropriate video, that example is fed back into the system so it improves over time. Google said it had already flagged five times as many videos as inappropriate for advertising, although it declined to provide absolute numbers on how many videos that entailed. With more than a billion videos on YouTube, 400 hours of new content being uploaded every minute and three million ad-supported channels on the platform, Mr. Schindler said it was impossible to guarantee that Google could eradicate the problem completely. He made a comparison to how a car company could not promise that even a new tire would never fail in the first 10,000 miles. No system can be 100 percent perfect, he said. But were working as hard as we can to make it as safe as possible.

Credit Doug Mills/The New York Times     WASHINGTON  President Trump said on Wednesday that Susan E. Rice , the former national security adviser, may have committed a crime by seeking to learn the identities of Trump associates swept up in surveillance of foreign officials by United States spy agencies, repeating an assertion his allies in the news media have been making since last week. Mr. Trump gave no evidence to support his claim, and current and former intelligence officials from both Republican and Democratic administrations have said they do not believe Ms. Rices actions were unusual or unlawful. The president repeatedly rebuffed attempts by two New York Times reporters to learn more about what led him to the conclusion, saying he would talk more about it at the right time. The allegation by a sitting president was a remarkable escalation  and, his critics say, the latest effort to change the story at a time when his nascent administration has been consumed by questions about any role his associates may have played in a Russian campaign to disrupt last years presidential election. Since March 4, when Mr. Trump posted on Twitter that President Barack Obama had wiretapped him at Trump Tower during the campaign, the president and his allies have repeatedly sought evidence trying to corroborate that claim, despite flat denials from James B. Comey, the director of the F.B.I., and other senior intelligence officials.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   Wednesdays interview revealed how Mr. Trump seizes on claims made by the conservative news media, from fringe outlets to Fox News, and gives them a presidential stamp of approval and also increases their reach.  Continue reading the main story         Advertisement   Continue reading the main story       Last week, some Republican television commentators asserted that Ms. Rice had improperly leaked the names of Trump associates picked up in surveillance of foreign officials. On Sunday, a conservative writer and conspiracy theorist reported, without identifying his sources, that Ms. Rice had been the one to seek identities of the Trump associates. Other conservative outlets picked up the report, and the Drudge Report website, which has been supportive of Mr. Trump, featured the story prominently. White House officials then accused mainstream news outlets of not giving the story proper coverage.   Trumps Interview With The Times           Read a partial transcript of President Trump's interview with The Times's Maggie Haberman and Glenn Thrush.         The interview with The Times was supposed to be focused on Mr. Trumps plans for large-scale spending on the nations infrastructure. But moments after it began, the president began talking about Ms. Rice. I think the Susan Rice thing is a massive story. I think its a massive, massive story. All over the world, Mr. Trump said. Its a bigger story than you know, the president added cryptically, also saying that new information would emerge in terms of what other people have done also. The Russia story is a total hoax. There has been absolutely nothing coming out of that, he said. Turning the subject to Ms. Rice, the president said: Whats happened is terrible. Ive never seen people so indignant, including many Democrats who are friends of mine.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   Through a spokeswoman, Ms. Rice said, Im not going to dignify the presidents ludicrous charge with a comment. In an interview with MSNBC on Tuesday, Ms. Rice said she had done nothing wrong. The allegation is that somehow the Obama administration officials utilized intelligence for political purposes, Ms. Rice said. Thats absolutely false.

LISTEN ON YOUR PODCASTS APP    LISTEN ON RADIOPUBLIC             Normally, when Americans are swept up in surveillance of foreign officials by intelligence agencies, their identities are supposed to be obscured. But they can be revealed  or unmasked  for national security reasons, and intelligence officials say it is a regular occurrence and completely legal for a national security adviser to request the identities of Americans who are mentioned in intelligence reports. Intelligence officials said any requests that Ms. Rice made would have had to be granted by the intelligence agency that produced the report. In most cases, that would likely have been the National Security Agency, which is responsible for electronic surveillance of foreign officials. Requests to learn the identity of a U.S. person were not routine, but also not uncommon, said Stephen Slick, a retired C.I.A. official who served as the senior director for intelligence at the National Security Council under President George W. Bush. Requesting that a name be revealed so that officials could make sense of an intelligence report was a normal part of the daily intelligence rhythm at the White House, State Department, Defense Department and other national security agencies, added Mr. Slick, who is now the director of the Intelligence Studies Project at the University of Texas at Austin. It could be a crime if Ms. Rice leaked the name of any American wrapped up in the surveillance net, but she flatly denied doing so in her MSNBC interview. I leaked nothing to nobody, and never have and never would, Ms. Rice said. The broader issue of how intelligence collected by the national security apparatus is disseminated and used has long been an animating issue for civil libertarians, a point that Mr. Trump made in the interview.

He also did not explain what he believed was unlawful in his estimation. It is not the first time Mr. Trump has made a provocative allegation without providing supporting evidence. One of the most notorious instances of this was his yearslong claim that Mr. Obama was not born in the United States. Like his statements about Mr. Obama  which he walked away from late in the 2016 presidential campaign  Mr. Trumps claims about Ms. Rice have taken hold in the conservative news media, where she has been a target ever since her press appearances after the terrorist attack on a diplomatic outpost in Libya in September 2012. Mr. Trumps March 4 Twitter message came after reports in conservative news outlets  including Breitbart, the website once run by the presidents chief strategist, Stephen K. Bannon  claiming that there had been surveillance of some kind against Mr. Trump when he was a candidate. Mr. Trump was widely criticized for the intemperate post, and he began to ask his advisers about how he might be able to investigate the issue. Weeks later, Representative Devin Nunes, the top Republican on the House Intelligence Committee, told reporters that he had learned of new information that Trump associates may have been surveilled in some way. He rushed to the White House to brief the president, even though it was later revealed that the information had come from White House officials. Representative Adam Schiff of California, the top Democrat on the Intelligence Committee, cast Mr. Trumps comments as part of a broader effort by the president to distract from the investigations into Russias interference in the election. The committee is running one of the investigations. He began by accusing President Obama of a crime without any evidence, Mr. Schiff said. Hes now moved on to accusing Susan Rice of a crime without any evidence, and this is sadly how this president operates.

Self-driving cars may be the future, and bioscience sure is interesting, but its the ads that pay the bills. Now, even as Google enjoys historic success, a run of bad news has exposed a vulnerability in its automated advertising system. In recent weeks, big advertisers have become increasingly concerned that their brands have been appearing alongside YouTube videos posted by extremists and other unwelcome material.

SCHWARTZ APRIL 5, 2017     Continue reading the main story  Share This Page   Continue reading the main story           Photo        A recent view of the Financial District in New York. Jobs in the citys securities industry are down by 10,000 from 2008.   Credit Todd Heisler/The New York Times        Bull markets arent what they used to be, at least when it comes to New Yorks economy. Although the stock market is surging and profits on Wall Street last year hit their highest level since 2012, the good times are not translating into jobs the way they did a decade ago, before the financial crisis and the Great Recession hit. Employment in the securities industry in New York City has risen for three straight years. But, at 177,000, there are still 10,000 fewer jobs in the sector than in 2008. And even if the stock market keeps rising and shares of behemoths like Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley continue to hit postcrisis highs, dont expect a surge in hiring on the Street. The securities industry is still a pretty important source of very highly paid, very highly skilled jobs, but its not really contributing to growth in the number of jobs, said William C. Dudley, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York . To be sure, financial services and banking remain a key part of the overall economy in the tristate area. The financial services and securities industry is the largest private-sector contributor to tax revenue in New York State.

Continue reading the main story         Advertisement   Continue reading the main story       What is more, Wall Street remains crucial for the regions tax base, especially for New York State. The securities industry accounted for 18.5 percent of Albanys tax revenues last year, and about 7 percent of the citys tax haul. But as is the case for the rest of the country, the financial sector is no longer quite as dominant as it once was in New York, Mr. Dudley said. Finance has not gotten smaller; instead other sectors, like technology, have grown much faster since the financial crisis.  Photo        A street scene last month outside the New York Stock Exchange. Wall Street profits last year hit their highest level since 2012.   Credit Todd Heisler/The New York Times    Mr. Dudley added that New Yorks economy has become more diversified, citing strong growth in the technology, hospitality and tourism sectors. He said that with roughly 150,000 workers, the tech sector in New York City is quickly catching up with total employment in the securities industry. New York is no longer a one-horse town when it comes to what drives the economy, said Chris Jones, senior vice president at the Regional Plan Association, a nonprofit research group that focuses on the tristate area. Tourism and technology have generated more jobs in the last decade and helped to diversify the economy. And while bonuses on Wall Street still dwarf those in other industries, annual payouts are also well below what they were before 2008, when Lehman Brothers and Bear Stearns still existed. The average bonus for the securities industry in New York City last year stood at $138,210, compared with a high of $191,360 in 2006, according to New York States comptroller, Thomas P. DiNapoli . The sectors healthy profits ($17.3 billion in 2016) come at a price. Part of how theyve kept profits up is that theyve kept head count down, Mr. DiNapoli said.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   In fact, the securities industry accounted for just 6 percent of newly created high-paying jobs from 2010 to 2015, compared with 25 percent in the 1990s and 2000s. Wall Street is still an important contributor to the economy, but I wouldnt expect a lot of growth in employment, Mr. Dudley said. Very low interest rates for years have also taken a toll, reducing profit margins at big banks, and forcing them to trim head counts and become more efficient. Some jobs also disappeared because the go-go days of huge leverage and light regulation are over, thanks to the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial reforms. With higher capital requirements, riskier activities have been pruned back.  Photo        The NYSE is reflected in a womans glasses in a street scene last month. The citys tech sector employment is catching up to that of the securities industry.   Credit Todd Heisler/The New York Times    Even if some of that regulation is reversed, as President Trump has promised, memories of 2008 are likely to curb a return to the days of big bets and crowded trading desks. Theres been a lot of pressure on trading jobs, said Laila Worrell, a partner at The Boston Consulting Group. Since 2009, the regulatory climate hasnt been superconducive for trading volume growth at big financial institutions.

While New York State recorded a 5 percent rise in securities industry jobs from 2010 to 2015, employment in the sector increased by 50 percent in Pennsylvania and 33 percent in Texas over the same period. On the other hand, New York could stand to benefit if financial firms exit London in the wake of Britains vote last summer to exit the European Union, the so-called Brexit. New York and London have been rivals in the financial world for decades, with Londons location and especially its time zone an advantage for traders dealing with Europe and Asia. Hedge funds expanded in the British capital, too, and some American policy makers feared London might overtake Wall Street.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   Almost exactly a decade ago, Michael Bloomberg, then the mayor of New York City, and New York Sen. Chuck Schumer even commissioned a report warning that London and other cities were eroding New Yorks traditional dominance in financial services. But in the wake of Brexit, and uncertainty about tax and regulatory policy looming for London-based firms, many finance jobs are up for grabs .

Credit Todd Heisler/The New York Times    Experts cite locales like Paris, Luxembourg and Frankfurt as alternatives to London, but Mr. Dudley said, New York is a potential place where people could ultimately move jobs, and the city could absorb them relatively easily. There are also a few niches in New York where head count is growing rapidly, like financial technology, with new hires creating software and applications for banks and brokerages, and designing trading strategies using algorithms and artificial intelligence. New York has become the worlds leading center for financial tech innovation, Ms. Worrell said. Its surpassed Silicon Valley because the financial institutions these companies serve are in New York. Proximity is very important. While the packed trading desks portrayed in 1980s classics like Oliver Stones movie Wall Street or the book Liars Poker by author Michael Lewis may be a thing of the past, not everyone misses that world. Indeed, Mr. Dudley, an economist who joined Goldman Sachs in 1986 and spent more than two decades at the firm, said Wall Streets flatter trajectory is fine with him. The financial services industry is in a pretty good place right now, he said. Its not quite rock n roll like we had in 2005 and 2006, but I dont think we want to go back to that period. I would take a more boring financial industry if it helped create a more stable U.S. economy. Mr. DiNapoli, the state comptroller, acknowledged that nearly a decade after the financial crisis, Wall Street remains unpopular in some quarters. But even if the big banks employ fewer of the masters of the universe than they once did, their outsize paychecks still ultimately benefit residents of the city and state.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   People have mixed opinions about Wall Street, but love em or hate em, its still a big part of the citys economy, Mr. DiNapoli said. We want New York to continue to be the capital of global finance.

Credit Eros Hoagland for The New York Times By  Miriam Jordan April 3, 2017 LAGUNA NIGUEL, Calif.  The delivery trucks began arriving with their precious parcels before daybreak, lining up outside a massive government edifice that rises above Orange Countys suburban sprawl. On Monday, the starting gun went off on application season for skilled-worker visas, known as H-1B visas, which allow employers, primarily technology companies, to bring in foreign workers for three years at a time. For the last few years, the federal government has been so overwhelmed by applications that it has stopped accepting them within a week of opening day, hence the line of trucks trying to deliver applications before the doors close on the program for another year. And this year, the rush has escalated to an all-out scramble because the future of the H-1B program is unclear . Hailed by proponents as vital to American innovation, the program has also been criticized as a scheme to displace United States workers with cheaper foreign labor. President Trump has vowed to overhaul it, and lawmakers from both parties have drafted bills to alter it. At campaign rallies, Mr. Trump introduced laid-off Americans who had been asked to train their foreign successors at companies that included Disney. We wont let this happen anymore, he thundered in one stump speech about the practice, which he has called outrageous and demeaning. This past weekend, United States Citizenship and Immigration Services announced a technical change that could make it harder for entry-level programmers to receive the visas, and on Monday, the Justice Department warned that it would investigate companies that it believed had overlooked qualified American workers. The Justice Department will not tolerate employers misusing the H-1B visa process to discriminate against U.S. workers, Thomas Wheeler, the head of the departments civil rights division, said in a statement. Each year, 65,000 H-1B visas are made available to workers with bachelors degrees, and 20,000 more are earmarked for those with masters degrees or higher. Image Trucks lined up at the center. On Monday, the government began accepting skilled-worker visas, which allow employers, primarily technology companies, to bring in foreign workers for three years at a time. Credit Eros Hoagland for The New York Times When the gates swung open at the government processing center here on Monday, the first truck in line, a FedEx rig, carried 15,000 packages, said a courier, Andrew Langyo. Were loaded, and we have more trucks coming, said Mr. Langyo, who would return two hours later in the same truck with another haul. Last year, the government received 236,000 applications in the first week before deciding it would accept no more. A computer randomly chooses the winners. The average H-1B petition, a collection of forms and documents attesting to the bona fides of a job offer and the person chosen to fill it, is about two inches thick. But some files are six inches thick and weigh several pounds, according to Bill Yates, a former director of the Vermont Service Center, which also processes H-1B applications. Mr. Yates recalled some mishaps, like the time a driver bound for the center in Vermont drove 50 miles unaware that his trucks back door had swung open, spilling its cargo onto the road. The visas are attractive not only to the companies that file the applications, but also to the workers themselves, who can become eligible for a green card while working on an H-1B. Among the petitions expected to land in Californias center is that of Minh Nguyen, a software-design engineer from Vietnam who was sponsored for an H-1B by BitTitan , a cloud software company in Kirkland, Wash. It is his second attempt at a visa. In America, youre in the center of new technology and cutting-edge changes in the I.T. industry, said Mr. Nguyen, 25. I would contribute directly to the company and to software development in the U.S. In 2014, the last year for which information is available, just 13 outsourcing firms accounted for a third of all granted visas. The top recipients were Tata Consultancy Services, Infosys and Wipro, all based in India. The companies, which subcontract their employees to banks, retailers and other businesses in the United States to do programming, accounting and other work, often inundate the immigration service with tens of thousands of applications. BitTitan, a growing company that hopes to hire 60 engineers in the next 12 months, is submitting six applications. We are trying to fill specific positions around cloud and artificial intelligence, the chief executive, Geeman Yip, said. If we cant fill them, our innovation suffers. Several bipartisan bills in the Senate and the House seek to make companies give more priority to American workers before they fill jobs with H-1B visas. They also seek to raise the minimum pay for the jobs, which depend on skill level and location: A computer systems analyst in Pittsburgh, for example, must make at least $49,000 under current regulations. The theory is that higher pay will eliminate some of the rationale for importing workers. A draft of a presidential executive order on protecting American jobs and workers by strengthening the integrity of foreign worker visa programs was distributed widely in late January but never signed. Then, without warning, Citizenship and Immigration Services published a memo on its website over the weekend that could affect many applications. Specifically, companies seeking to import computer programmers at the lowest pay levels will have to prove that the work they perform qualifies as specialty labor, which is what the H-1B visas were created for. There will be greater scrutiny of the role the company wants to fill, said Lynden Melmed, a lawyer in Washington and a former chief counsel for the immigration service. The measure appears to be directed mainly at outsourcing firms, rather than the big technology companies, which tend to hire workers at higher skill and pay levels. In a statement, the National Association of Software and Services Companies, the main trade group for Indias outsourcing industry, said, The H-1B visa system exists specifically because the U.S. has a persistent shortage of high-skilled I.T. talent. Image Shipments of H-1B visa petitions arrived Monday at a government processing center in Laguna Niguel, Calif. The visas are commonly used to bring technology workers to the United States. Credit Eros Hoagland for The New York Times The group said that its members followed all the programs rules, and that the change would have little impact. It is aimed at screening out less-qualified workers, whereas our members tend to provide well-credentialed workers to help U.S. companies fill their skills gaps and compete globally, it said. Even before the memo and the Justice Departments warning, fears about the future of the H-1B program were making this year more pressure-packed than most. Just to make sure the petitions get in, almost every client demanded that theirs arrive on the first day, said Greg McCall, a lawyer at Perkins Coie in Seattle who prepared 150 applications. Inside the federal building, a formidable structure that has provided backdrops for movies including Coma and Outbreak, the logistical dance unfolded over two floors. In the mailroom, about 40 people wearing blue gloves sat around tables opening packages that arrived nonstop in six-foot-high bins. In a huge warehouse, those same packages were separated according to whether the applicants had bachelors or masters degrees. All told, 1,500 workers were involved, with a second shift expected to stretch past normal business hours. This is the day we prepare for months and months in advance, said Donna P. Campagnolo, the centers deputy director. Trucks came and went all day, with some couriers, including from FedEx, staggering their deliveries to avoid having dozens of trucks backed up at the gate. Some smaller delivery companies received a piece of the action, too. One courier, Fernando Salas, pulled up in a red Suzuki station wagon stuffed with 10 boxes. I have 109 envelopes, he said. That is all that fits in here. It was all surprisingly low-tech for a program used primarily for high-tech jobs. Asked why the government had not digitized the process, Ms. Campagnolo said: Theres obviously a lot of paper. Theres no denying it. The biggest challenge, she said, is trash overflow.

It was filled almost instantly, and the waitlist swelled to 130. This semester, the law school has five programming classes, and the waitlist still overflowed. They arent going to become programmers, but they realize these are skills that will make them better lawyers, said Paul Ohm, the Georgetown law professor who teaches the course. His students, for example, learn to write short, tailored programs that can identify clusters of words and concepts in Supreme Court rulings more accurately than a Google search or standard legal software. Its the same in every field, from marketing to manufacturing to medicine. Code, it seems, is the lingua franca of the modern economy. So you have no plans to become a computer engineer, no dreams of being code wizard at Google or Facebook. But youve decided its time to pick up practical technology knowledge and skills, including writing some code. There are options aplenty, in college classes, online courses and boot camps. The offerings range widely in terms of time required, skills mastered and price tag, from free to more than $20,000 for some six-month programs.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   In College Enrollment in computer science courses has exploded in recent years, with both majors and nonmajors fueling the surge  so much so that many schools now restrict enrollment by nonmajors.  Continue reading the main story         Advertisement   Continue reading the main story       One recent institutional adaptation is the creation of so-called CS+X initiatives at schools like Stanford, Northwestern and the University of Illinois. These programs are hybrid majors that combine computing with other disciplines, including anthropology, comparative literature and history  a nod to the reality that software skills can advance research in nearly every field. But the main on-ramp to computing for non-techies is an introductory computer science class. Today, at many universities, at least half of the student population takes the intro courses. At Stanford, its 90 percent. These classes include coding as a window to computational thinking, which involves abstract reasoning, modeling and breaking down problems into the recipelike steps of an algorithm. That kind of thinking, said Ed Lazowska, professor of computer science at the University of Washington, has become an essential component of a 21st-century liberal arts education. Programming, he said, is the hands-on, inquiry-based way we teach computational thinking.     Interactive Feature  The New A.P.: Coding Lite  Not a computer whiz? Not a problem. Try these practice exam questions from Computer Science Principles.         OPEN Interactive Feature      The programming language for an introductory course, professors say, is not so important, though Python, JavaScript and Java are widely used. David J. Malan, a computer science professor at Harvard, has students work in several different languages in his popular introductory course for majors and nonmajors, CS50. The main goal, he says, is to demystify technology and provide a foundation for students who want to go further. You come to realize its just one idea after another, layered on top of each other, Dr. Malan said. No matter what your academic or career path, he has this advice: Take at least one course in computer science. Its just so useful and empowering, he said.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   At Boot Camp At the nations coding boot camps, the pitch has nothing to do with a liberal arts education. This thriving niche of the for-profit education business tightly links courses to the job market. Jim Deters, chief executive of Galvanize, which operates eight coding campuses, compares boot camps to accelerated graduate programs. Except when you graduate here, you get a job, not a piece of paper, he said. Galvanize, whose six-month web development course costs $21,000, says that 91 percent of its graduates land jobs using their newly acquired skills within six months. According to Course Report , which tracks coding camps, the industry average is 73 percent; median post-camp salary is $65,000. Today, there are 91 coding campuses across the country, producing 18,000 graduates last year, up from fewer than 2,200 in 2013, Course Report says. Programs vary, but the average length is 13 weeks and average cost $11,500. Most boot camp programs are full-time immersives, and the curriculum is tightly focused on the skills most in demand in the marketplace  these days, web development and data analysis. But this young industry is evolving and adding short introductory sessions and online courses. At General Assembly, which operates 20 boot camp campuses, one of the most popular offerings is Programming for Non-Programmers, said Jake Schwartz, the chief executive. The two-day version of the course costs $525. General Assembly also has a free online course, Dash, which covers the basics of writing software for the web. When considering a boot camp, first sample the free offerings. Try it out before you commit your money, said Liz Eggleston, co-founder of Course Report. Coding camps are not regulated or accredited. Within the industry, initiatives are underway to establish standards for required reporting of graduation and job placement rates. The leading boot camps are disclosing those numbers already. Some universities have started their own coding camps. Their efforts are mainly courses added to continuing education programs, and tap the expertise of outside partners.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   Trilogy Education Services, which manages skills-based training programs, is working with the continuing education arms of more than 20 universities, including Northwestern, Rutgers, the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and the University of California, Berkeley. The six-month courses, with classes held evenings and weekends, cost nearly $10,000. The initial course is on web development, but a new one on data analysis and data visualization is being added. Students graduate with new skills and a portfolio of work, said Dan Sommer, chief executive of Trilogy, and they can qualify for certificates that verify they took and completed the curriculum. Online Coursera, edX and Udacity, three major providers of MOOCs, or massive open online courses, have evolved into hubs for teaching computing skills. Their most popular courses are nearly all programming and technical. On edX, the lone nonprofit, the course taken by more people than any other is the online version of Harvards introduction to computer science, CS50. The course is free, but for $90 students get a certificate of completion. Labor market demand largely explains the dominance of computing offerings. But Richard C. Levin, the former president of Yale and chief executive of Coursera, suggests another factor. Digital subjects, he said, are more naturally suited to being taught online. You really can do it yourself with technology courses, Dr. Levin said. Or at least you dont lose as much by not having the classroom experience as you do with the liberal arts. Courseras classes can be taken free, but the track for earning a certificate costs $39 to $79 a month, depending on the course. Udacity has developed more than a dozen certificate-bearing programs it calls nanodegrees, including digital marketing, Android programming, artificial intelligence and self-driving car engineering. The course work is created in partnership with leading companies in those fields, like Facebook, Google, IBM and Mercedes-Benz. A nanodegree course typically costs $200 a month, but if you complete it within 12 months you get half your money back. Sebastian Thrun, the co-founder and chairman of Udacity, who is a former Stanford professor and Google scientist, said his company has found a way to improve the notoriously low completion rates for online courses. Add people. Last year, the company started a service called Udacity Connect for face-to-face work with mentors on weekends, for $100 a month when added to any nanodegree program. A self-service website is not enough, Dr. Thrun said. Having a human companion can have an enormous effect on finishing rates, as much as tripling the chances of success. And as he sees it, success in programming requires a certain kind of human empathy. Its a people skill, said Dr. Thrun, who created and led the self-driving car project at Google, getting your brain inside the computer, to think like it does and understand that its just a little device that can only do what its told.
