Her eye shadow was a pale pink.   Credit Noel West for The New York Times     On an Oscars night when plots mattered down to the last envelope (for real), three beauty story lines emerged early on. That they were more daring looks  creative short hair, pink eye shadow and a severe center part  may say something of how we view women of our times: confident, self-possessed and not to be messed with. Punky Short Hair For actresses, fortunes are made on hair (ad campaigns, magazine covers and even roles), and lots of it. But the styles that had the most to say on Oscars night had the least amount of hair to work with. In a sea of Veronica Lake waves and tasteful (if bland) low chignons, Scarlett Johansson s side-shaved rock n roll pompadour felt so fresh that Halle Berry (who had a hair moment herself with a voluminous mane) told Ms. Johansson when passing her on the red carpet, Youre making me miss short hair. Ms. Johansson has been wearing cropped hair for about three years now. Her hair stylist, Sean Mikel, has gradually taken her hair shorter, he said, and he created the current iteration just two days before the big event. There are still varied lengths in this look, which gives her more versatility than a pixie, Mr. Mikel said.

Continue reading the main story         Advertisement   Continue reading the main story       I didnt want it to be too precious, Ms. Cho said, adding that she had originally considered a safer side-parted do before going with the cooler style. Besides, she said, with short hair, you exude confidence because you cant hide behind anything. Ms. Cho added that she wanted to reflect that empowered feeling: Its like a feminist movement happening in beauty right now.

Credit Frazer Harrison/Getty Images    The same could be said of Michelle Williams , whose closely cropped and bleached pixie created a mesmerizing monochromatic effect with her skin tone; Viola Davis, whose spiky flop of bangs managed to be both sharp and alluring; and Ruth Negga, who has worn a variety of creative short styles throughout awards season. For Oscars night, her hair was nearly casual (gently curly and slightly voluminous) but for the ruby headband created by Irene Neuwirth for Gemfields. Ms. Negga doesnt like her hairstyles to look contrived, said her hairstylist, Vernon Francois. The actress also likes to highlight her natural texture. For a woman of color to show diversity by wearing her curls and to put it on the platform as big as the Oscars is pretty powerful, Mr. Francois said. Shes saying, This is who I am.  Photo        Michelle Williams came with a bleached pixie cut.   Credit Noel West for The New York Times    Pink but Not Rabbity Lids Magenta, brick-red and baby-pink eye makeup has been spotted at fashion shows and on Instagram for several seasons now, but the trend is not for the faint of heart. Go too rosy and you look like a bunny early for Easter. Veer too dramatic and youre a character in Memoirs of a Geisha. So it was laudable that Ms. Negga and Naomie Harris worked the startling look with believable aplomb.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   Ms. Harriss deep magenta version, by the makeup artist Mario Dedivanovic, was the boldest, complementing the slick graphic appeal of her white Calvin Klein dress. Though the color spoke volumes, Mr. Dedivanovic used a light hand. He applied sheer washes of matte red hues ( Chanel Quadra Eyeshadow in Candeur et Experience), followed by a touch of coppery shimmer in the center of the eye.  Photo        Naomie Harris offset her white gown with bold deep magenta eye shadow with a shimmer of copper at the center. Her long hair was parted in the center.   Credit Mike Nelson/European Pressphoto Agency    The idea was to look very fashion-forward, yet elegant and chic, he said. Mr. Dedivanovic was more inspired by runway looks and the style of Ms. Harriss dress than Instagram, he said, and the difference was in the details. If I had used a heavy black liquid liner to go with the color, it would have made it much more Instagram, he said. Rather, he subtly defined Ms. Harriss lash lines with a dark-brown liner (Chanel Stylo Yeux Waterproof Long-Lasting Eyeliner in Mat Taupe). The effect was far more fresh, he said. No red carpet invite in your near future? Perhaps Ms. Johanssons pearly pink eye makeup is worth a try. The makeup artist Frankie Boyd countered Ms. Johanssons aggressive hair style with soft, beautiful makeup. With the hair she was doing, I didnt want to do heavy makeup and make her look like a caricature, he said. So, to shade the lid, he used pale rosy eye shadows ( Nars Duo Eyeshadow in All About Eve and Velvet Shadow Stick in Hollywoodland). Mr. Boyd knows that women at home may shy from pink for its possible pitfalls. He suggested staying away from matte colors and using light shimmery hues instead. Another trick: Apply a light pink color in the center of the lids, but use taupe at the inner corners of the eyes to avoid that pinkeye look.  Photo        Jessica Biels severe hairstyle was also parted in the middle, with a sculptural flip in back.   Credit Noel West for The New York Times    The 70s Center Part Is Back Beachy waves, the dominant hair aesthetic on and off the red carpet for years, suggests sun, frolic and, well, the beach. And while curling irons were surely in use on Oscars night, the more attention-grabbing styles took a severe turn. Several center-parted looks  on Ms. Harris, Jessica Biel , and Jennifer Aniston  hailed a return to the minimalism of the early 90s. The mood right now is a little harder, with a little more structure, said Adir Abergel, the hairstylist and Virtue creative director. He pointed to the center-parted updo with a sculptural flip in back that he created for Ms. Biel. Drawing inspiration from Modernism, Frank Gehry buildings and geishas alike, Mr. Abergel used a Dyson Supersonic hair dryer to create an unbending blowout. Then, to enhance the smooth finish, he worked Ms. Biels hair from roots to ends with Virtue s One for All 6-in-1 Styler. To secure the updo shape, he used bobby pins and spritzed Finale Shaping Spray, also by Virtue, all over. For me, a middle part is a very strong dramatic statement, he said. And straight hair gives the look more strength, which says something of what were feeling of the times. It also conveys simplicity and a kind of bareness  like were starting again.

A Sikh man in nearby Kent was shot on Frida   Credit Ted S. Warren/Associated Press     NEW DELHI  American and Indian officials on Sunday swiftly condemned the shooting of a Sikh man in a suburb of Seattle, which followed by less than two weeks a similar episode in Kansas and amid a high-level crackdown on immigration. The man, 39, was in the driveway of his home in Kent, Wash., working on his car on Friday night when a white man, wearing a mask over the lower part of his face, confronted him and then shot him in the arm, The Seattle Times reported . The police have asked the F.B.I. and other law enforcement agencies for help finding the gunman, who the victim said told him to go back to your own country. The victim was identified as Deep Rai, a United States citizen of Indian origin. India s minister of external affairs, Sushma Swaraj, said she had spoken to the victims father, who said his son was out of danger and recovering in a private hospital.

The suspect in that case, Adam W. Purinton, had confronted the two Indians over their visa status and had been escorted out of the bar, before returning and opening fire. Mr. Kuchibhotla died from his injuries.  Continue reading the main story         Advertisement   Continue reading the main story       The episode was front-page news in India, which sends hundreds of thousands of legal immigrants to the United States each year, among them students and highly skilled workers. Since the Kansas shooting, many Indians have expressed concerns that racially motivated violence will rise in the coming years, as President Trump leads an effort to curtail legal immigration and deport illegal immigrants. The White House has denied that the violence is in any way connected with Mr. Trumps policies.

Washingtons top envoy in India, MaryKay Loss Carlson, said she was saddened by the shooting in Washington State. As @POTUS said, we condemn hate and evil in all its forms, Ms. Carlson said in a Twitter post . The Sikh Coalition , a Sikh rights group based in New York, has urged the authorities in Washington State to investigate the shooting as a hate crime, and called on top officials in Washington to forcefully condemn such attacks. Tone matters in our political discourse, because this is a matter of life or death for millions of Americans who are worried about losing loved ones to hate, Rajdeep Singh, a Sikh Coalition leader, said in a statement to the Hindustan Times.

A meeting with Club Brugge, of course, was hardly the sort of achingly glamorous meeting Leicester had craved for the clubs first-ever game in the Champions League.

You can be the longest shot in the history of Oscar nominees, he said. You still have to think you have the teeniest, tiniest, half-percentage-point chance of winning walking into that room.  Mr. Quenqua, who has worked on numerous Oscar campaigns, including one for The Help, said that there are multiple reasons that long-shot contenders cling to hope. Aside from ego  and dont underestimate that factor in Hollywood  actors and actresses, from their earliest days auditioning, dont make it very far if they have a defeatist attitude. Upsets from past Oscars can also contribute to magical thinking; nobody thought voters would select Marisa Tomei as best supporting actress in 1993 for her gum-smacking girlfriend in My Cousin Vinny, but they did. _________   Think you know defeatist?

Credit Rob Carr/Getty Images     Update, Feb. 28, 2018 : We have announced our 2018 Student Editorial Contest . Update, May 18 , 2017: We have published the winners of the 2017 Student Editorial Contest . _________  Is Social Media Making Us More Narcissistic?  Do Teachers Assign Too Much Homework?  Should the Drinking Age Be Lowered? Every day during the school year we invite teenagers to share their opinions about questions like these  on topics from reality TV to the justice system  and hundreds do, posting arguments, reflections and anecdotes to our Student Opinion feature. Now, for the fourth year in a row, were inviting you to channel that enthusiasm into something a little more formal: short, evidence-based persuasive essays like the editorials The New York Times publishes every day.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   The challenge is pretty straightforward. Choose a topic you care about, gather evidence from sources both within and outside of The New York Times, and write a concise editorial (450 words or less) to convince readers of your point of view.  Continue reading the main story         Advertisement   Continue reading the main story       Because editorial writing at newspapers is a collaborative process , you can write your entry as a team effort or by yourself. When youre done, post it in the contest form below by April 4, 2017, at 11:59 p.m. Eastern. With our judges, we will then use this rubric (PDF) for selecting winners to publish on The Learning Network. As teachers know, the persuasive essay has long been a staple of high school education, but the Common Core standards seem to have put evidence-based argumentative writing on everybodys agenda. You couldnt ask for a more real-world example of the genre than the classic newspaper editorial  and The Times publishes, on average, four of them a day. And at a time when breaking out of ones filter bubble is more important than ever, we hope this contest also encourages students to broaden their news diets by using multiple sources, ideally ones that offer a range of perspectives on their chosen issue. So what issue do you care about? Gun violenc e ? Sexism ? Animal testing ? You decide, but here are 401 writing prompts that might give you ideas, and here is a link to last years winners so you can see what were looking for. Good luck, and please post any questions you might have in the comments and well answer you there. _________  Video   How to Write an Editorial    The New York Timess editorial page editor Andrew Rosenthal provides seven tips for writing an effective editorial.  By Jason Spingarn-Koff on Publish Date February 5, 2014.  .  Watch in Times Video          embed            To help with this challenge, Andrew Rosenthal, in his previous role as Editorial Page editor of The Times, detailed seven pointers in the video above. And we published two related lesson plans,  For the Sake of Argument: Writing Persuasively to Craft Short, Evidence-Based Editorials  and  I Dont Think So: Writing Effective Counterarguments  that offer additional teaching ideas.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   We have also culled a list of 401 prompts for argumentative writing organized by category, to help inspire you  although, of course, you are not limited to those topics. We encourage you to look at both our comments on last years winners and the winning essays themselves . They can serve as excellent models, and they cover topics from 3-D printing to Guantanamo Bay . _________ Rules 1. Use at least one Times source. You can write your editorial about any topic, as long as you use at least one source from The New York Times. That should pretty much open the whole world to you, as you may be surprised how much you can find in The Times . Be advised that NYTimes.com has a digital subscription system in which readers have access to 10 free articles each month, but after that you will be asked to become a digital subscriber. However, all Times articles linked from The Learning Network, as well as The Learning Network itself (with the exception of lesson plans) are free . That means you can use any of the articles linked from this site for the editorial contest without exceeding the 10-article limit. (The Times has also introduced a new K-12 subscription plan , which covers digital access schoolwide.) 2. Use at least one non-Times source. Make sure, however, that the source you use is a reliable one. We encourage you to find sources that offer different perspectives on an issue. 3. Always cite your sources. Our submission form contains a required field for entering your citations. We include an example as well. Even if you use a print source or an expert interview, you must cite your sources. Readers (and judges) should always know where you got your evidence. 4. Be concise. The editorial must be no more than 450 words. Your title and list of sources are separate, however, and do not count as part of your 450-word limit. 5. Have an opinion. Editorials are different from news articles because they try to persuade readers to share your point of view. Dont be afraid to take a stand.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   6. Write your editorial by yourself or with a group. If you are working as a team, just remember to submit all of your names when you post your entry. However, please submit only one editorial per student. If youre submitting as part of a team, you should not also submit as an individual. 7. Be original and use appropriate language. Write for a well-informed audience, but include enough background information to give context. Be careful not to plagiarize: Use quotation marks around lines you use verbatim from another source, or rephrase and cite your source. 8. Submissions must be from students who are 13 to 19 years old, although students can come from anywhere in the world. Unlike in previous years, students can now use their entire name if they want. 9. All entries must be submitted by April 4, 2017 , at 11:59 p.m. Eastern time using the contest form above. If you have questions about the contest, please feel free to post them in the comments section as well, and well answer you there. 10. Follow these instructions if you need proof that you entered this contest. Within an hour of submitting your editorial, you should receive an email from The New York Times with the subject heading Thank you for your submission to our Student Editorial Contest. If you dont receive the email within an hour, even after checking your spam folder, then you can resubmit your entry. Be sure your settings allow emails from nytimes.com. After two attempts and waiting over one full day, if you still have not received a confirmation email, you can email us at LNFeedback@nytimes.com using the email address you used in the contest form with the subject heading Please send me an email confirmation for my editorial contest submission. Be sure to include your name and editorial title (or subject) in your email. You may have to wait up to one week for a reply. 11. We will use this rubric (PDF) to judge entries,  and the winning editorials will be featured on The Learning Network. _________ Additional Resources Suggested by Teachers Writing an Editorial Unit Plan by Lindsay Thompson   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   Reader Idea | He Said, She Said, I Say: A Researched Argument Essay by Danielle Harms Reader Idea | Using an Op-Doc Video to Teach Argumentative Writing by Allison Marchetti   Reader Idea | Using Room for Debate to Teach Argumentative Writing and Discussion Skills by Gerard Dawson and Justin Rex Reader Idea | An Argument-Writing Unit: Crafting Student Editorials by Kayleen Everitt Good luck and have fun.

Credit Shawn Thew/European Pressphoto Agency     Have you witnessed a classroom discussion where someone voiced an unpopular or minority viewpoint? How was it received by students? By the teacher? Think about classroom scenarios where deep discussion was encouraged and respected, despite wide differences of political or social opinion. What went well, even in the face of divergent beliefs? In  The Isolation of College Libertarians , Tom Ciccotta writes: A liberal arts education should push students to take intellectual risks and see the world in new ways. Unfortunately, it doesnt always play out that way.  Leftists, in an effort to make campuses welcoming  ostensibly, for everyone  end up frequently silencing conservative and libertarian students. They paint any argument that isnt progressive as immoral, so conservative students can find themselves branded as such. Needless to say, this can be socially isolating.  Animosity toward campus conservatives and libertarians was a common topic among students at the Conservative Political Action Conference last weekend in Washington. Many of us who attended are outliers on our liberal campuses, and there was a general feeling of excitement and relief to be among like-minded peers.  One discussion, about how to deal with protests against conservative speakers visiting campus, became a bonding session for those of us who have found that we cant bring up controversial topics without being told we are fomenting hate or invalidating someone elses existence. One student remarked that it was harder for him to be openly conservative on campus than it was to tell his peers he was gay.  I am a senior at Bucknell University studying economics. I am a libertarian: I believe in limited government and the importance of individual liberty, especially the right for people to be whoever or whatever they want, regardless of skin color, sexual orientation, religion, gender or political leanings.  I see the attempts of students from both sides of the political aisle to silence one another. But there are a lot more liberals than conservatives at most campuses, and a growing tendency to reject conservative ideas as oppressive is taking a toll on learning. Students: Read the entire article, then tell us:  Were you able to empathize with Mr. Ciccottas circumstances and perspective? Why or why not?  Have you ever had a classroom experience in which you felt your own or others views were not welcome?  In what ways does the silencing of views and opinions within schools take a toll on learning?  Mr. Ciccotta says Political intolerance is hardly confined to one side of the aisle. If conservatives represented the majority of students on campus, I am sure they would be silencing liberals. Universities must push back against the narrowing of ideology generally to guarantee an open intellectual space for all students. Do you agree? Why or why not? If you agree, what suggestions do you have for schools, teachers and students?   For a related opinion, see "Advice for My Conservative Students" by Colby College professor Aaron Hanlon.

O'Donnell/The New York Times; Illustration by Sam Manchester/The New York Times     Are you a sports fan fed up with the length of the games or matches, the expense to see the game in person, the changing rules, or the seemingly never-ending seasons? Even if you arent a sports fan, what bugs you about professional sports, and why? In  Baseballs Too Slow. Heres How You Fix It , The New York Times writes: Major League Baseball officials are finally addressing something that many fans have complained about for years: the length of games. The average game last season took three hours. Playoff games are even more trying, now often stretching beyond three and a half hours. So what should be done? We invited our reporters and readers to submit proposals. Heres a selection :  Broaden the Audience. Shorten the Ads.  Major League Baseball wants more action and less downtime during games. Thats probably asking too much, because hitters are paid to work deep counts while pitchers throw harder, with better movement, than ever before. Its no accident that the number of strikeouts rises every year.  The larger issue, of course, is expanding the business, which means attracting more fans. And baseball wont touch the biggest impediments to that effort, because it would mean less money now. Want to make the game move more quickly? Cut every commercial break by 30 seconds. Want more people to watch in the postseason? Insist that Fox show the League Championship Series on its regular network, not on the hard-to-find Fox Sports 1.  This is most important: Make the World Series appointment viewing, as it was a generation ago. October will mark the 30th anniversary of the last World Series game held in the afternoon. If you want to appeal to young fans in all areas of the country, let them watch at least one World Series game every year before bedtime. Theyll repay that good-will gesture when they grow up, if baseball can wait that long for the payoff.  TYLER KEPNER Students: Read the entire article, then tell us:  Did you agree with any of the suggestions about changing the sport of baseball? If so, which ones, and why? If not, why not?  If you could change anything you wanted about any sport, what sport would you change? How and why would you change it?    Are there any changes you would make to the sports you play now, in school or extracurricularly? What would those changes be, and why? See this related article for the recent changes in the rules for professional golf. Students 13 and older are invited to comment.

Credit Nathan Hunsinger/Dallas Morning News, via Associated Press     Watch this news video from January 2016 to determine how the International Olympic Committee changed its rules for transgender athletes for the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro. What was the rule before the change? Do you think the new rule is a good idea? Why or why not? In  Transgender Boy Wins Texas Girls Wrestling Title , The Associated Press writes: A 17-year-old transgender boy completed an undefeated season on Saturday by winning a Texas state girls wrestling championship  an accomplishment clouded by criticism from those who believe the testosterone he is taking as he transitions from female to male gave him an unfair advantage.  The family of Mack Beggs has said he would rather be wrestling boys, but state policy calls for students to wrestle against the gender listed on their birth certificates. So Beggs beat Chelsea Sanchez, 12-2, in the girls 110-pound weight class to improve to 56-0 and earn the state title.  Flanked by his Euless Trinity teammates after they won second place in Class 6A, the largest division in Texas, Beggs broke his silence.  I wouldnt be here today if it werent for my teammates, he said. Thats honestly what the spotlight should have been on is my teammates. The hard work that I put in the practice room with them, beside me  we trained hard every single day. Every single day, and thats where the spotlight should have been on. Not me. All of these guys. Because I would not be here without them. Students: Read the entire article, then tell us:  Do you think it was unfair for Mack Beggs to be prohibited from competing with boys, as he wishes? Why or why not?  What rules do you think should apply to transgender athletes when they compete? What factors came into play in your decision?    The International Olympic Committee rules for transgender athletes are consistent with the National Collegiate Athletic Association rules. In your opinion, should these rules also be applied to teenage transgender athletes who compete at the high school level? Why or why not? Students 13 and older are invited to comment.

What questions does it raise for you? At the very bottom of the article is an explanation of How We Made Our Matrix. It reads: We built the list of events based on news coverage of the first month of the Trump administration in The Times and elsewhere. We created our expert panel based on recommendations from four political scientists, as well as on research of people who had experience serving in past administrations, and we aimed for diversity of thought and background. We know our panel is small and does not reflect every point of view, but we feel it represents a useful guide to developments by people with deep experience studying or serving in government. Does this answer any of your questions? Why do you think it was important to include this information? Questions for Comprehension and Analysis 1. What news events fell into the Abnormal and Important category? Which single event in that category was seen as the most important to the panelists, and why?

How did Anne-Marie Slaughter, who is chief executive of New America, a left-leaning think tank, and an Obama administration State Department official, describe the type of government that sows distrust as a way of discrediting anything that is negative or critical of it?
