But theres another race going on, too: to be the biggest provider of the technology under the hood of the driverless vehicles. In that race, Intel just took a big step , writes Mark Scott, a European technology correspondent for The New York Times.

The deal highlights a rush by the chip maker not only to supply chips for driverless cars  the vehicles need a lot of computing power to drive without human assistance  but also to provide additional technologies. In this field, Intel is competing with other chip makers, such as Nvidia and Qualcomm.

Above, the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona, Spain, last month.   Credit Paul Hanna/Reuters     In the world of driverless cars, household names like Google and Uber have raced ahead of rivals, building test vehicles and starting trials on city streets. But when it comes to what is under the hood, an array of lesser-known companies will most likely supply the technology required to bring driverless cars to the masses. And in a $15.3 billion deal announced on Monday, Intel moved to corner the market on how much of that technology is developed. The chip makers acquisition of Mobileye , an Israeli company that makes sensors and cameras for driverless vehicles, is one of the largest in the fast-growing sector and sets the stage for increasing competition between Silicon Valley giants as well as traditional automakers over who will dominate the world of autonomous cars. The likes of Google and Uber have already invested billions of dollars in their own technology, signing partnerships with automakers like Chrysler and Volvo and sending test vehicles onto the road in a bid to cement their place in the industry. The sector is estimated to be worth $25 billion annually by 2025, according to Bain & Company, a consulting firm.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   Faced with an existential threat to its legacy computer business, Intel  alongside competitors like Qualcomm  has focused on autonomous cars as a new and potentially lucrative market. Many of these driverless vehicles, experts say, will require immense computing power, including the latest microchips able to crunch reams of data in seconds to keep the cars safe, and on the road.  Continue reading the main story         Advertisement   Continue reading the main story       And by acquiring Mobileye, whose digital vision technology helps autonomous vehicles safely navigate city streets, Intel aims to broaden its offerings beyond just chips to a wider suite of products that driverless vehicles will require. It hopes, as a result, to appeal to automakers that want to offer autonomous driving but lack the in-house expertise and do not want to rely on the likes of Google. Scale is going to win in this market, Brian Krzanich, Intels chief executive, told investors on Monday. I dont believe that every carmaker can invest to do independent development into autonomous cars. Intel has a history with such strategic moves. It cornered the personal computer market over more than three decades, supplying hundreds of millions of desktop computers with much of their internal architecture, after dominating which microchips were used in the industry. But in recent years, Intel has struggled to find its feet as peoples habits have increasingly turned to the mobile world, where the companys chips have lost out to rivals. Last year, for instance, the company announced that it was laying off 12,000 people, or 11 percent of its global work force, as demand for personal computers continued to decline. While Intel still earns more than half of its annual revenue from traditional computing chip-making operations, the companys sales from its internet of things division, a unit that includes its burgeoning automaking team, grew 15 percent in 2016, to $2.6 billion, according to regulatory filings . Over the last 18 months, Intel has signed partnership deals with BMW and Delphi Automotive , an auto parts supplier, to expand its presence in the field. It also acquired a 15 percent stake in Here, a digital mapping business owned by a consortium of German automakers, and announced last year that it would invest $250 million in start-ups working on driverless car technologies. Mobileye, founded in Jerusalem in 1999, has signed deals with several automakers, including Audi, for the use of its vision and camera technology, which uses machine learning and complex neuroscience to help drivers  and increasingly cars themselves  avoid obstacles on the road.     Graphic  The Race for Self-Driving Cars  There are increasing signs that autonomous cars have arrived  and may be driving on our city streets sooner than we think.         OPEN Graphic      It also has longstanding ties with Intel. The chip maker was a partner with Mobileye and BMW last year over efforts to bring autonomous cars to city streets by 2021. In January, the companies announced plan s to have up to 40 autonomous cars on American and European roads by the end of this year as part of initial trials.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   As that collaboration grew, Intel and Mobileye executives began talking about a potential takeover at the end of December, holding meetings, mostly in New York, to complete a deal in which Mobileyes executives would take the lead in new expanded efforts. This deal makes Intel a Tier 1 partner for the automotive industry, said Martin Birkner, an automotive analyst at Gartner, a technology research company in Munich. As the industry moves toward autonomous driving, new types of digital suppliers like Intel are developing quickly.

As part of the deal, Intel said it would buy Mobileyes outstanding shares at $63.54 a share, a 34 percent premium to Mobileyes closing price on Friday. The acquisition requires shareholder and regulatory approval, and is expected to close by the end of this year. Much of Intels success will depend on Amnon Shashua, Mobileyes co-founder and chief technology officer, who has a doctorate in brain and cognitive sciences from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Part of Mr. Shashuas plan is to have cars with Mobileyes advanced driver assist systems collect imaging and location data that can be used to create what the company calls RoadBook  a vast digital map of roadways in the United States and Europe. The goal, Mr. Shashua said, is to provide carmakers with a complete product line of digital services that go beyond what they can do for themselves. The collaboration that we want to do cant happen if we are two different organizations, he said on Monday. The collaboration already runs deep.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   Still, experts say autonomous cars are unlikely to hit the roads by the end of the decade, at the earliest, because regulators are beginning to question which rules such cars should follow and because of struggles to make the technology work seamlessly. Uber, the ride-booking service, halted its driverless car tests in California after local officials said the company did not have the required permits, though its tests in Pittsburgh are continuing. Googles own efforts ran into difficulties after the companys driverless cars were involved in a spate of collisions. And in Europe, regulators are divided on the issue of self-driving cars, causing the automotive industry to complain that the delays could hamper plans to take the technology to the streets there. Still, with technology companies and global automakers making hefty  and costly  bets on autonomous cars, experts that say more deals like Intels acquisition of Mobileye are likely to follow as firms jostle for position. More acquisitions, said Mr. Birkner of Gartner, are an absolute necessity. Carmakers and Silicon Valley companies, he said, are realizing that they both bring different skills to the table.

Intel is buying autonomous-car-parts maker Mobileye for $15.3 billion, a price that will demand high performance in a competitive if fast-growing market.   Credit Patrick T. Fallon/Bloomberg     Intel has put the self-driving pedal to the financial metal. Buying Mobileye for $15.3 billion values the autonomous-car-parts supplier at 30 times this years estimated revenue, according to Thomson Reuters data. Justifying such a price tag will take some doing. Mobileye specializes in helping cars see what is around them. Intel makes high-performance chips and runs data centers. Combining the two should mean better design systems that are aware of their surroundings, crunch huge amounts of data and react on the fly. Intel estimates that the market for vehicle systems, data and services will be $70 billion in 2030. While that is an absurdly long time frame for a financial prediction, the eventual amount could easily be far higher. The fast-expanding ability of computers to make sense of the world by sight will probably create undreamed-of markets. Combining the entrepreneurial Israeli outfit and the blue-chip Intel may be awkward; Intel has struggled to integrate acquisitions before. Having paid $7.7 billion for McAfee in 2010, for example, Intel sold a majority of the unit six years later in a deal valuing it at just $4.2 billion.

The $175 million of expected cost cuts carry a present value of around $1 billion once taxed, discounted and capitalized. That is a country mile from the roughly $4 billion premium that Intel is paying. That leaves Mr. Krzanich and his shareholders relying on Mobileyes stunning growth continuing. Revenue is running at a 45 percent annual clip, while its operating margin of around 35 percent in recent quarters could hit 60 percent in the coming years, according to the consensus estimate of Wall Street analysts.

Credit Nvidia     Its something that many of us have experienced while driving, though we may not like to admit it. Its called a microsleep, a brief state of drowsy unconsciousness that can happen even if your eyes remain open. Drowsy driving kills. According to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, drowsy driving caused 824 deaths in 2015, the last year for which figures are available. Several manufacturers, including Audi, Mercedes and Volvo, currently offer drowsiness detection systems that monitor a vehicles movements, such as steering wheel angle, lane deviation, time driven and road conditions. When drowsiness is detected, drivers are typically warned with a sound and the appearance of a coffee cup icon. But manufacturers and automobile suppliers are now working on advanced technological solutions that go beyond visions of coffee cups.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   To find out if drowsiness can be detected even earlier, Plessey Semiconductors has developed sensors, to be placed in a seat, that monitor changes in heart rate.  Continue reading the main story         Advertisement   Continue reading the main story       Algorithms developed by the company indicate when breathing changes to patterns that are typical of someone who is sleeping, giving a warning before someone actually feels tired. We could see this in a vehicle in five years, said Keith Strickland, chief technology officer of the company, which is based in Plymouth, England. Bosch , a German supplier of technology to many automotive companies, is developing a camera-based system that will monitor head and eye movements, as well as body posture, heart rate and body temperature.  Photo        Driver Alert Control, standard in the Volvo XC90, detects and warns tired or inattentive drivers, and directs them to the nearest rest area.   Credit Volvo Cars    When such a system is used in vehicles that allow for limited autonomous driving, the vehicle could take over once drowsiness is detected  either coming to an emergency stop or pulling itself off to the side of the road, said Kay Stepper, Boschs head of driver assistance and automated driving. In addition, sensors on the outside of the vehicle will monitor the state of traffic in which the fatigued driver is engaged. Once vehicles can communicate with each other  a capability expected in the next few years  other cars will be able to take appropriate maneuvers to avoid the drowsy driver. In France, Valeo , another supplier of automotive technology, is developing an infrared camera system that will monitor children in the rear seat as well as the drivers shoulder, neck and head movements, looking for deviations from the norm. Checking body temperature and even how the driver is dressed, the system will also be able to customize the interior temperature for each driver, said Guillaume Devauchelle, the companys innovation director.

The system will eventually learn a drivers standard posture, head position, eye-blink rate, facial expression and steering style, among other indexes. Based on a vehicles capabilities, the driver will be warned or automatically driven to a safe spot when conditions warrant. Until vehicles can drive themselves, it will be up to drivers to pull over once they feel drowsy. But drivers tend to make excuses, believing there is no danger because they are just a few minutes from home, or they are not really as tired as they may feel. The more tired you are, the less able you are to change your behavior, such as by pulling off the road for a short rest, said Mikael Ljung Aust, a technical specialist working on drowsiness mitigation technologies at Volvos Safety Center in Gothenburg, Sweden. To encourage drowsy drivers to take a break, Volvo, with a grant from the European Commission, is studying the effects of offering drivers free coffee once erratic steering wheel movements, lane departures and other signs detect that they are falling asleep, using the navigation system to direct them to the nearest coffee stop.

Credit Mercedes-Benz    Audi is faced with a unique problem because of its scheduled introduction next year of a car capable of driving up to 35 miles per hour without any driver intervention. When its Traffic Jam Pilot feature is engaged, the vehicle will need to determine if a driver is alert enough to take control after being a passive passenger for long periods. Through its Driver Availability Detection system, sensors will scan the head and face to ensure that the eyes are open and the driver is alert before the car turns over the steering wheel. Advanced drowsiness detection systems exist today. For example, Mercedess Attention Assist monitors a drivers behavior for the first 20 minutes behind the wheel to get a baseline of behaviors. Then, the system checks those against as many as 90 indexes, such as steering wheel angle, lane deviation and external factors such as wind gusts and pothole avoidance.

If drowsiness is detected, the driver is alerted to the nearest rest stop. For the past decade Volvo has offered its Driver Alert system. To detect drowsiness, we study the car, not the driver, said Mr. Aust of Volvo, looking at differences in the ability of the car to stay in lane, and other factors. The system detects drowsiness with 97 percent accuracy, Mr. Aust said. While N.H.T.S.A. reported 824 deaths in 2015 because of drowsiness, that number is likely to be considerably higher, the agency said. Drowsy driving can only be self-reported and not measured like drunkenness. Also, drowsiness is not reported when it is a complication of other factors like excessive drinking. Were a nation of tired drivers. People talk about sleep deprivation as if its a badge of honor, said Deborah Hersman, the head of the National Safety Council and the former chairwoman of the National Transportation Safety Board. As a society we have to realize that drowsy driving is really dangerous. Until fully autonomous vehicles are a reality, drowsiness is something everyone needs to worry about, said Mark R. Rosekind, former head of N.H.T.S.A. and an expert on human fatigue. Our tendency is to say were wide-awake when in reality we can fall asleep in a second. Still, the obvious solution for a driver who feels fatigued is to pull over and rest. According to Mr. Rosekind, studies with airline pilots show that those who took a nap for 26 minutes improved their performance by 34 percent and alertness by 54 percent, compared with those who did not. Regardless of how good technology is at detecting drowsiness, fighting off sleep is futile. Because sleep is a biological need, the best solution for drivers is still a low-tech one: Pull over and take a nap.

Ackman announced Monday that his firm, Pershing Square Capital Management, had sold its stake  about 27 million shares  in Valeant Pharmaceuticals International.   Credit Drew Angerer for The New York Times     William A. Ackman staked his reputation as a savvy stock picker on his ability to oversee a turnaround at Valeant Pharmaceuticals International. Even as troubles mounted, he maintained that he had an enormous stomach for volatility. But it seems even Mr. Ackman didnt have an appetite for the time and resources that Valeant required. Mr. Ackmans firm, Pershing Square Capital Management, sold its entire stake in the pharmaceutical company, which had expanded by aggressively buying up other rivals but has been overwhelmed by, among other things, questions over its accounting and political pressure over its drug pricing. Valeants stock has plummeted from a high of $257 in 2015, closing at $12.11 on Monday. The two-year bet lost about $4 billion for Pershing Squares investors.

Continue reading the main story         Advertisement   Continue reading the main story       As the Financial Times notes , Mr. Ackman is not the only investor to have lost money because of Valeant, but being on the Valeant board required time and Mr. Ackman had to deal with questions from his own investors about the holding. The saga also illustrates the risks of Mr. Ackmans strategy of focusing on just a handful of big bets at a time: Losses on J. C. Penney and the bet against Herbalife have offset big gains on Canadian Pacific Railway and GGP, the mall developer, The Wall Street Journal reports. Intel Buys Mobileye The driverless car industry is racing ahead and Intel wants to control the technology under the hood. Its $15.3 billion deal for Mobileye , an Israeli company that makes sensors and cameras for driverless vehicles, is an effort to ensure Intels role supplying autonomous cars with the immense computing power they will need with its chips and data centers.

There are questions about how much Intel paid for the company though. Mobileye will need to maintain its current stunning rate of growth for several years, even as plenty of other firms are gunning for the market, Robert Cyran writes in Breakingviews . It wont be easy. The self-driving auto unit of Alphabet is already claiming that it is pushing down prices for the imaging technology that maps the surroundings of autonomous cars, which would make it tough for Mobileye to maintain its profit margins, according to Bloomberg .   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   Preet Bhararas Legacy For years, Mr. Bharara  who was fired as United States attorney for the Southern District of New York  was accused of letting Wall Street off the hook. Then he became a man who apparently terrified Wall Street (though critics said this was the result of overreach). Neither of these narratives is quite accurate, Andrew Ross Sorkin writes. Mr. Bharara is a pragmatist, and one with a proclivity for publicity. Sometimes, though, he just did not have enough of a case. As he said in an interview with Worth magazine , People are being jerks and stupid and greedy and negligent, but you cant pin a criminal case on them. But his successes in court did have some deterrent effect. Much of the trading community lived in fear of his office and firms have tightened up their compliance programs. So what happens to his cases? One of them appears to be continuing without him. (The removal of a United States attorney often does not have a direct impact on pending investigations, Peter J. Henning points out.) A federal grand jury is expected to hear testimony soon from witnesses about business practices at Fox News when it was led by Roger E. Ailes, according to people with knowledge of the matter. Mr. Ailes was forced out after multiple accusations of sexual harassment, charges he has denied. Worth noting: One of the people mentioned as a possible successor to Mr. Bharara is Marc L. Mukasey, who has represented Mr. Ailes.   Follow Amie Tsang on Twitter @amietsang .

When Portos Bakery & Cafe added a location in Buena Park this month, more than 1,500 people got in line. Some waited hours to get the Cuban restaurants cheese rolls and potato balls. That got us wondering: What is it about some restaurant openings that turn eating out into a phenomenon? Using CrowdTangle, an analytics tool, we identified five of the buzziest restaurant openings of the past year, according to cumulative likes, shares and comments on Facebook posts by California news publications. They are: 1.  Trejos Tacos , Los Angeles Danny Trejo, the actor known for his menacing onscreen portrayals, opened his restaurant on La Brea Avenue a year ago. More than 80,000 people liked a Facebook post about it by KTLA. Mr. Trejos celebrity certainly played a part, but so did the menu . Along with traditional meat tacos, it offered vegetarian fare  kale salads, a roasted cauliflower bowl, a seared carrot and tofu chorizo taco.

Two weeks later, the line is still about 45 minutes. Asked why customers are so devoted, Mr. Porto talked about being a family business with 50 years of history in Los Angeles. Were just simple people who have no clue of marketing or anything like that, he said. I think weve built just an incredible following. 3.  Cracker Barrel , Victorville News that the Tennessee-based chain planned to open its first California location in 2017 sent social media into a frenzy with dreams of hashbrown casseroles and baked apple dumplings. (Other out-of-state chains have also thrilled Californians by simply showing up. See: Five Guys in Bakersfield, and Dunkin Donuts in National City.) 4.  In-N-Out , London But it goes both ways. When In-N-Out opened a pop-up restaurant across the Atlantic last fall, people stood in line for hours to sink their teeth into a California burger and fries.

Seeing a stump where a tree once stood in Oakland, a passer-by was apparently reminded of the childrens book The Giving Tree.

Well, said the tree,  straightening herself up  as much as she could,  well, an old stump is good  for sitting and resting.  Come, Boy, sit down.  Sit down and rest. Later, images of the Oakland stump were posted  to Reddit , the social media site, where they elicited thousands of comments. Many saw it as an elegy for loss and recalled how the book had affected them as children. Some admitted shedding tears.

Sean Maher, a spokesman with Oaklands public works department, said he was unable to find out. In the end of The Giving Tree, the boy, now an old man, sits, making the tree, now a stump, happy.

By TOM VOELK on Publish Date March 16, 2017.  Photo by Martin Campbell.  Watch in Times Video          embed            I first experienced radar-assisted cruise control in a $70,000 Mercedes in 2001. Slowing automatically to keep from hitting the car ahead felt like a magic trick. In 2009, I was told to drive a new $50,000 Volvo into the back of a parked car (really, an inflatable mock-up). Every fiber of my body wanted to stomp on the brake pedal. Instead, the car did it for me. Automatic braking is mind-bending the first time. Both of these technologies are standard equipment on 2017 Toyota Corollas, which start at $19,385. So is lane-keeping assist, which nudges the car back between the road stripes if you wander. Automatic high-beam headlamps, too. Huzzah for technology trickle down! A number of mainstream automotive brands now offer valuable safety technology once exclusive to premium makes. Often, they are option packages or part of higher trim levels. Toyota is putting Toyota Safety Sense, or T.S.S., on many of its passenger cars as standard equipment. This, as Martha Stewart would say, is a good thing. Just make sure you understand which T.S.S. you are getting.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   The tested Corolla sedan gets T.S.S.-P., which provides automatic braking with pedestrian detection, adaptive cruise control, lane-keeping assist and automatic high beams. Buyers wanting the more practical Corolla iM hatchback get T.S.S.-C., which lacks radar cruise control and the pedestrian detection part of the auto-braking system.  Continue reading the main story         Advertisement   Continue reading the main story       There is more legalese in Toyotas T.S.S. literature than Os in a box of Froot Loops, but here is what to expect: Auto braking (called a precollision system by Toyota) operates at 7 to 110 miles per hour. When detecting cars, it can reduce the speed by up to 25 m.p.h. Pedestrian detection works from 7 to 50 m.p.h. reducing speed by up to 19 m.p.h. In general, the adaptive cruise control works from 25 to 110 m.p.h. The biggest surprise in these numbers is that a Corolla can actually go that fast. This technology is not the grade found in premium brands. For now, Corollas adaptive cruise control doesnt keep pace in stop-and-go traffic, but it should reduce dented fenders, bumpers and skulls. That is a good start and will probably help to sell this car, which rides on an architecture that is about 10 years old. But other than the high tech, the Corolla as an automobile is basic transportation. It runs with a 1.8-liter 4-cylinder engine that delivers 132 horsepower and 128 pound-feet of torque. The Eco model has 8 additional horsepower. The transmission is continuously variable with steering wheel paddle shifters that provide surprisingly crisp simulated gearshifts. There is also a sport mode, but dont fall for that promise. The safety technology may calm the spirit, but Corollas driving dynamics will not stir the soul. It accelerates and stops just fine for a budget car. Drivers may often be making small course corrections when cruising. There is little road feel and the tires and suspension dont handle bumps in a calming way. The continuously variable transmission has the elastic feeling common to continuously variable transmissions. For engaging handling or refinement in this size, go with the Honda Civic , Chevy Cruze, Hyundai Elantra or Mazda 3.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   On average, the Environmental Protection Agency rates Corollas fuel economy average at 32 miles per gallon. That is about what I saw. The cabin looks fine for a modestly priced car. There is a lot of hard plastic to rub elbows with and the hide on the seats is clearly synthetic but its probably durable for the long haul. That is the point of a Corolla. At $23,545 as tested, the XSE model has automatic climate control and heated seats. A backup camera is standard equipment (that is something the luxury brands could learn from), and the controls are straightforward down to the basic touch-screen interface. No Apple CarPlay or Android Auto, if that is a deal breaker. There is room for two full-size adults in back, three if they are skinny. The trunk has the space of some midsize sedans. A folding split back seat lets long boxes of Ikea furniture ride along. In the looks department, Corolla has a pleasant enough profile, with a crisp shoulder line near the rear pillar. The scowl of the redesigned front end resembles Darth Vaders mask. You half expect to hear the sound of a respirator. Automobile enthusiasts often sneer at the appliance that is Corolla. But some people simply need the luxury of a car, not a prestige automobile. There are many single parents who require affordable wheels with a three-year warranty. That is the kind of security used cars dont offer. Plus, there is peace of mind in the electronic nannies. The auto braking and lane keeping features arent a license to text and drive. It is important for drivers to remain engaged since it takes only a few seconds of distraction for things to go seriously wrong. It would be helpful to outfit all vehicles with safety tech like T.S.S.-P. for unexpected moments. Toyota has made lifesaving features affordable. Now, how about adding some life to Corollas personality?

Credit Wayne Parry/Associated Press     Say goodbye to the thimble, the boot and the wheelbarrow, Monopoly fans. There are new tokens in town. Hasbro , the maker of the real-estate-trading board game, on Friday announced the results of a poll that asked fans in more than 100 countries to choose which tokens will circle the board in the next Monopoly game coming out in the fall. The Scottie dog, top hat, roadster car, cat, and battleship tokens will return. But the boot got the boot, and so did the wheelbarrow and the thimble.

The announcement came just before World Monopoly Day on Sunday.

Hasbro had asked fans in January to choose the next generation of tokens from a list of 64 options, which included the current lineup. More than 4.3 million votes were counted.  Photo        The T-rex was the most popular of the three new tokens.   Credit Wayne Parry/Associated Press    The most popular token in the voting was the Scottie dog, the stout little pup that has clattered its way past Go countless times on Monopoly boards worldwide since it was introduced in the 1950s. The T-rex was the second most popular option among the voters, followed by the top hat and the racing car, which have both been in circulation since the 1930s, when the game first made its appearance on American living room tables. The rubber ducky and penguin were the final inductees, joining the cat and the battleship. Some fans of the game seemed to feel strongly about which of the tokens should stay and which should go. The competition was fueled by online campaigning from outside forces, Hasbro said. Zipcar, the car-sharing company, advocated for the survival of the car token by asking fans to #SaveTheCar. The New England Aquarium got in the spirit by tweeting photographs of their penguins to #VotePenguin, and hosting a Facebook live event to Monopolys nearly 11 million Facebook fans. The company has opened up its revamping of the token lineup in previous polls. In 2013, fans voted to drop the iron.
