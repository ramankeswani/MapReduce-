Hayden March 9, 2017 The relationship between a new president and the intelligence agencies that serve him can be difficult in the best of times. But its hard to imagine a more turbulent transition than the current one, which has been marred by assertions that the administration has tried to both politicize and marginalize intelligence gathering. No White House likes it when intelligence agencies  such as the National Security Agency, the Central Intelligence Agency or the Defense Intelligence Agency  deliver bad news, or when that information undercuts the executives preferred policies or political positions. But I cant remember another White House so quick to dismiss those agencies judgments or so willing to discredit them as dishonest or incompetent. Weve seen presidential tweets with intelligence in accusatory quotation marks, a kind of dog whistle that equates intelligence assessments with news reporting that the president condemns as fake. In addition to lumping the intelligence agencies in with the dishonest mainstream media, the president has compared his espionage services to Russians, Nazis and WikiLeaks. Last weekend, Mr. Trump accused President Barack Obama of ordering phones at Trump Tower tapped during the 2016 campaign, a claim so outrageous that James Clapper, the former director of national intelligence, denied it a day later. (So did the F.B.I. director, James Comey, according to this paper.) And last month, Mr. Trump blamed the intelligence community, along with the press, for the downfall of his first national security adviser, Michael T. Flynn, saying on Twitter that information is being illegally given to the failing @nytimes and @washingtonpost by the intelligence community (N.S.A. and F.B.I.?). As the former director of both the N.S.A. and the C.I.A., I know that leaks are a real problem that can endanger national security. But why would the administration reflexively and punitively blame its own services for leaks, since we do not yet know who is responsible for them? The president has asserted that the leaking will stop because now we have our people in, a choice of words that creates more than a little shudder in the ranks of intelligence professionals, who prefer to work in the background for presidents, Democratic or Republican. Mr. Trump may not appreciate the size of that community  17 separate agencies, more than 100,000 workers, from analysts to computer programmers to case officers. So far he has put in place only Mike Pompeo, the director of the C.I.A., while his choice for director of national intelligence, Dan Coats, awaits confirmation. He may also not appreciate that new presidents rarely make major changes to the intelligence agencies, a tradition of treating the intelligence community as apolitical professionals that has been handed down from administration to administration for decades. In 2009 only I, the director of the C.I.A., and Mike McConnell, the director of national intelligence, were quickly swapped out. President Obama even personally intervened to keep in place the rest of the C.I.A. team that served President George W. Bush. In 2001 President Bush replaced no one. That apolitical spirit was reflected in Mr. Pompeos tribute to the professionalism and dedication of his predecessor, John Brennan, even as Mr. Trump was condemning Mr. Brennan. Mr. Pompeos personal closeness and access to Mr. Trump has helped the intelligence community get over some of the hard feelings generated by the presidents dismissal, even before he was elected, of its flagship product  the Presidents Daily Brief  which Mr. Trump deemed unworthy of his daily attention. But there is no evidence that Mr. Pompeo or anyone else in the community was consulted before the administrations chaotic rollout of its original executive order banning the entry of people from seven predominantly Muslim countries. (I signed a friend-of-the-court brief that said the order made America less safe .) Even more troubling are press reports that the administration ordered intelligence agencies to build a case for why these countries represent a danger sufficient to justify the redrafted executive order. Starting with a policy and then asking intelligence professionals to provide the rationale is a corruption of a healthy process, where solid intelligence rather than campaign hyperbole should set the context for discussion. The politicization became even more troubling when the White House chief of staff, Reince Priebus, cited anonymous intelligence sources to claim that the investigation into links between aides to Mr. Trumps campaign and Russia was dead. I can assure you, and Ive been approved to say this, that the top levels of the intelligence community have assured me, Mr. Priebus said, that the allegation is not only grossly overstated, but also wrong. Mr. Priebuss language was political, emotional and dismissive. It in no way even tried to mirror the precise phrasing of intelligence. Indeed, one intelligence official was moved to pointedly deny any involvement in drafting or approving Mr. Priebuss specific comments, according to The Washington Post. This is exactly where intelligence professionals do not want to be: thrust into the partisan arena of political masters who have different rules, vocabulary, goals and standards. It reminds me of the Benghazi controversy, in which the intelligence community became entangled in a sustained political fracas that led to charges that it was cooking intelligence to protect the Obama administration. I dont envy Mr. Pompeo and Mr. Coats. They have to run complex enterprises and produce quality intelligence even as they push back against an administration that has questioned their officers integrity, has been casual in its use of intelligence and is not above calling on intelligence professionals to provide political cover. And they must push back hard, because whether Mr. Trump appreciates it or not, he, and the country, need an independent intelligence enterprise, not a compliant one. Michael V. Hayden, the director of the Central Intelligence Agency from 2006 to 2009 and the National Security Agency from 1999 to 2005, is the author of Playing to the Edge: American Intelligence in the Age of Terror.

Credit Drew Angerer/Getty Images     WikiLeaks on Tuesday released a significant cache of documents that it said came from a high-security network inside the Central Intelligence Agency . WikiLeaks called the documents Vault 7 , and they lay out the capabilities of the agencys global covert hacking program. What is the C.I.A. program? By the end of 2016, the C.I.A. program had 5,000 registered users, including government employees and contractors. And they had produced more than a thousand hacking systems. The agencys arsenal, the documents indicate, included an array of malware ranging from viruses to clandestine zero day vulnerabilities in the software of major companies. The files have circulated among former United States government hackers and contractors in an unauthorized manner, one of whom provided WikiLeaks with portions of the archive, WikiLeaks said. WikiLeaks said it was publishing the documents while redacting and anonymizing some passages, including the names of tens of thousands of C.I.A. targets. WikiLeaks said it was not distributing armed cyberweapons.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   How vulnerable is my smartphone? The software targeted by the hacking program included the most popular smartphone operating systems: Apples iOS and Googles Android.  Continue reading the main story         Advertisement   Continue reading the main story       The C.I.A. hacking initiative had a mobile devices branch, which developed an array of attacks on popular smartphones to infect and extract data, including a users location, audio and text messages, and to covertly activate a phones camera and microphone. Apples iPhone software, according to the documents, was a particular target, including the development of several zero day exploits  a term for attacking coding flaws the company would not have known about. Though Apple has only 15 percent of the global smartphone market, the intensive C.I.A. effort was probably explained by the popularity of the iPhone among social, political, diplomatic and business elites. Finding these vulnerabilities could in theory allow the spy agency to circumvent the kinds of security that stymied investigators who wanted to gain access to the password-protected iPhone of one of the attackers in the 2015 mass shooting in San Bernardino, Calif. Googles Android, the most widely used smartphone operating system, seemed to have received even more attention. By 2016, the C.I.A. had 24 weaponized Android zero day software programs. Did the C.I.A. directly target encryption software? The C.I.A. focused on smartphone operating systems in large part to intercept messages before they could be encrypted, according to the WikiLeaks documents. So by targeting the phones underlying software, the C.I.A. was looking to bypass the encryption of Wha tsApp, Signal, Telegram, Weibo and other smartphone communications applications. They did not appear to find a way into the apps themselves. Were other kinds of devices targeted? The C.I.A. also targeted Microsofts Windows personal computer software, other internet-connected computers, and home and industrial devices running the Linux operating system, according to the documents.

The program, code-named Weeping Angel, was intended to convert new digital televisions into covert microphones. The malware was developed in cooperation with the British spy agency MI5, according to the documents.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   The Weeping Angel program puts the target TV in a fake off mode, according to the WikiLeaks documents. Then, with the owner believing the TV is turned off, the set works as a clandestine recording device, picking up conversations in the room and sending them over the internet to a C.I.A. server computer. And in October 2014, according to the documents, the C.I.A. was exploring technology to penetrate the vehicle control systems of cars. The documents do not detail the goal of the vehicle hacking program, but WikiLeaks speculated that it would permit the C.I.A. to engage in nearly undetectable assassinations. Has encryption software changed how the C.I.A. behaves? The leaked documents indicate that the broad use of encryption has pushed the C.I.A. to become one of the worlds foremost creators  and buyers  of malware. Much of the cache released by WikiLeaks appears to show how the agency has created or acquired a variety of tools to thwart tough encryption or intercept messages before encryption tools make them useless to the intelligence agency. What is new about the C.I.A. program? Using malware to hack into devices ranging from smartphones to webcams has been going on for years. Sometimes the intent is to steal information  like names, addresses and credit-card numbers for identity theft and fraud. Sometimes the goal seems to be to create havoc. Last year, for example, household and commercial webcams and router computers were taken over and used as launching pads to create so-called denial-of-service attacks that clogged portions of the internet and interrupted service for hours for people in parts of the United States. But the C.I.A. program seems to have been particularly sophisticated, far-reaching and focused on surveillance. Just how innovative the individual software techniques were will not be known until independent computer security experts and scientists at the companies whose software was probed can examine the malware and tactics involved. What time period is covered by the documents? WikiLeaks says the document dump will cover 2013 to 2016. The organization says this is the largest publication of intelligence documents in history. If the documents are accurate, did the C.I.A. violate commitments made by President Barack Obama ? In 2010, the Obama administration promised to disclose newly discovered vulnerabilities to companies like Apple, Google and Microsoft. But the WikiLeaks documents indicate that the agency found security flaws, kept them secret and then used them for surveillance and intelligence gathering. Why is it so hard to keep these cyberweapons under wraps? Unlike nuclear weapons, which can be guarded and protected, cyberweapons are just computer programs which can be pirated like any other, WikiLeaks notes. Since they are entirely comprised of information they can be copied quickly with no marginal cost.

There are steps you can take to shield your device from hackers.   Credit Emilio Morenatti/Associated Press     The documents revealed by WikiLeaks that indicate the Central Intelligence Agency has been sitting on a collection of spy-friendly software vulnerabilities are certainly intriguing. More worrisome, perhaps, is the question of who else knows about these security weaknesses. Hackings are rarely discovered in a secure facility accessed only by spooks. They are more often than not found in the online bazaar of hackers and cyberweapons dealers trading security information for fun and profit. And the C.I.A. is hardly the only intelligence agency looking to acquire that information. It is safe to say that intelligence and law enforcement authorities from most countries  not to mention a wide array of hackers  are on the lookout for ways to break into smartphones and other security devices.

Schiff, right, the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, during a news conference with Representative Devin Nunes, the Republican committee chairman, last week.   Credit Gabriella Demczuk for The New York Times     WASHINGTON  They agreed just a week ago to the terms of a House Intelligence Committee investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential election. But now some of the panels Democrats are warning that they may pull their support for the inquiry if it becomes mired in party-line politics. When that might happen is unclear, and Democrats know that the current moment of even tentative comity on the Republican-controlled panel may offer their best chance for scrutinizing links between people close to President Trump and Russian officials. Still, Democrats are bracing for fights over subpoenaing witnesses and documents  including, possibly, Mr. Trumps tax returns  since Republicans have balked at an outside, independent inquiry into what intelligence officials say was an unprecedented intrusion into an American election by a foreign power . Im not going to be part of a dog-and-pony show that is not a serious effort to do an investigation because this is really serious, said Representative Jackie Speier, Democrat of California. If its not a legitimate and comprehensive and in-depth investigation, why would we be party to it?   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   Ms. Speier said the committees Democrats  all nine of whom were interviewed by The New York Times  would not hesitate, under certain circumstances, to pull their support.  Continue reading the main story         Advertisement   Continue reading the main story       Democrats are already wary of moves by the committees chairman, Representative Devin Nunes, Republican of California, to undercut the purported Russian connection. Mr. Nunes has belittled news stories about the Russian links of Mr. Trumps associates and has pledged  along with Senator Richard M. Burr, the North Carolina Republican who leads the Senate Intelligence Committee  to examine Mr. Trumps accusations, made without evidence, that President Barack Obama ordered surveillance of Trump Tower. Mr. Nunes was a prominent supporter of Mr. Trumps campaign and served on the administrations transition team . So far, some Democrats on the House panel said, Mr. Nunes had been receptive to many of their requests in the inquiry. Most of us would agree that theres no way were participating in any form of cover-up or whitewash, so we will walk away if the moment requires, said Representative Jim Himes, Democrat of Connecticut.

Schiff of California, the committees top Democrat, said it was unclear whether the panel could conduct a credible investigation, ideally resulting in a single, bipartisan report on its findings. Along with Mr. Nunes, Mr. Schiff is among the so-called Gang of Eight congressional leaders who receive classified intelligence briefings. If we get to the point at any time where I feel we cant do that, where there are legitimate lines of investigation that are being walled off, then I will say so, Mr. Schiff told reporters this week. Democrats expect the first major test of the investigation  and Mr. Nuness stewardship  to come on March 20, when the committee holds its first public hearing. An initial list of invited witnesses included James B. Comey, the F.B.I. director; James R. Clapper Jr., the director of national intelligence under Mr. Obama; and Sally Q. Yates, the former acting attorney general who was fired by the Trump administration after refusing to defend the presidents first travel ban. Absent from the witness list was Michael T. Flynn, Mr. Trumps first national security adviser, who resigned after it was revealed that he had misled Vice President Mike Pence and other White House officials about his conversations with the Russian ambassador. Though Mr. Nunes emphasized it was only an early list, he referred to Mr. Flynn as a tangent, portraying him as more of a victim of the intelligence leaks Mr. Nunes is seeking to investigate than a target of the inquiry.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   From everything that I can see, his conversations with the Russian ambassador, he was doing this country a favor, and he should be thanked for it, Mr. Nunes said. Mr. Nunes may need to tread cautiously to avoid the perception of crossing the line from impartial moderator to advocate. He has said the issue of whether Trump Tower was under surveillance during the campaign was well within the scope of the inquiry, and has denied that he added it after the president demanded that Congress investigate. With a tight smile, Mr. Schiff said he welcomed the opportunity to disprove Mr. Trumps accusation. But some Democrats fumed at the idea that the panels work could give credence to it. Should the issue not be put to rest quickly, Ms. Speier said, it would call into question the entire investigation. Several Democrats said they expected their desire to compel certain witnesses to testify to stoke friction among Republicans. But a flash point could come if Democrats press to subpoena Mr. Trumps tax returns, a move that could scuttle the entire inquiry. Democrats have favored an outside, independent investigation, but many of them see the panels inquiry as the best they can do. And they are keenly aware that by pulling their support, they would sacrifice their roles in an investigation some see as among the most important of their time in public service. Its a big jump to pull out of this investigation, no matter how bad it is, said Representative Mike Quigley, Democrat of Illinois.

Leaks    The founder of WikiLeaks, Julian Assange, said the Central Intelligence Agency lost control of a large arsenal of cyberwarfare tools and then covered up that the material was not secured. He said WikiLeaks is working with companies like Apple and Microsoft to better secure devices.  By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS.  Photo by WikiLeaks, via Associated Press.  Watch in Times Video          embed            WASHINGTON  For years, Julian Assange , the founder of WikiLeaks , has been derided as an anti-American anarchist, indiscriminate in publishing leaks and far too cozy with Russia. For more than four years, he has been hiding out in the Ecuadorean Embassy in London to avoid sexual assault investigators in Sweden. But on Thursday, fresh from revealing the largest leak of classified documents in C.I.A. history , Mr. Assange tried to turn the tables on his critics, presenting himself as a defender of the United States top technology companies from overreaching, double-dealing American spies. The 8,000 C.I.A. documents that WikiLeaks made public this week  the first installment in a far larger collection, Mr. Assange said  showed that the agency had found flaws in the most popular products of the internet age: iPhones, Android phones, software used in every office and even internet-connected televisions. But instead of alerting the companies so they could plug the security holes, the agency exploited the weaknesses to carry out cyberspying around the world. So Mr. Assange, speaking by video in an online news conference , offered a lifeline to the companies, saying the antisecrecy organization was prepared to share leaked computer code that it has not yet published with Apple , Google and other technology companies to help them fix the flaws described in the leaked C.I.A. documents.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   We have decided to work with them to give them some exclusive access to the additional technical details we have, so that fixes can be developed and pushed out so people can be secured, Mr. Assange said.  Continue reading the main story         Advertisement   Continue reading the main story       The companies reacted cautiously to the WikiLeaks offer, saying there could be legal complications in accepting classified information stolen from the government. Sean Spicer, the White House press secretary, advised the companies to seek legal advice before accepting the leaked code. I do think that I would check with the Department of Justice in particular about if a program or a piece of information is classified, he said at a press briefing. It remains classified regardless of whether or not it is released into the public venue or not. Microsoft suggested in a statement that it did not want to be seen as collaborating with WikiLeaks, declaring dryly that its preferred method for anyone with knowledge of security issues, including the C.I.A. or WikiLeaks, is to submit details to us at secure@microsoft.com . Microsoft, Apple and Google all said that some of the C.I.A. attacks had targeted old versions of their software and would be blocked by recent updates. WikiLeaks reputation was marred in some circles by its previous splash in the news, the release last year of emails from Hillary Clintons presidential campaign that were believed to have come from Russian government hackers. Now Mr. Assange, who once worked as a computer security specialist, insists that his goal was to safeguard the privacy of everyones communications from the intrusive gaze of the C.I.A. Why has the Central Intelligence Agency not acted with speed to come together with Apple, Microsoft and other manufacturers to defend us all from its own weapons systems? he asked. The C.I.A. issued an unusually lengthy response, emphasizing that any spying it does is restricted by law to foreigners and foreign countries, with Americans off limits. As weve said previously, Julian Assange is not exactly a bastion of truth and integrity, the C.I.A. statement said. Despite the efforts of Assange and his ilk, C.I.A. continues to aggressively collect foreign intelligence overseas to protect America from terrorists, hostile nation states and other adversaries.

When an intelligence agency or the F.B.I. wanted to make use of a major chink in a companys technological armor, it first had to get approval through a committee organized by the White House. At a sort of court of vulnerabilities, intelligence agencies argued for using the flaw for surveillance, while other officials made the case for revealing it to Apple, Microsoft, Google or some other firm. The default position was to disclose the vulnerability, said Michael Daniel, the cybersecurity coordinator at the National Security Council under President Barack Obama, who ran the process. Last year, the administration said in congressional testimony that over 80 percent of vulnerabilities discovered by the government had been revealed to the industry. But there were moments, Mr. Daniel said on Thursday, when the committee he assembled judged that it was in the national interest to keep secret a zero day flaw  so named because the target would have zero days of notice that there was a vulnerability. That would give the National Security Agency, the C.I.A. or the F.B.I. time to exploit it. Not all of the flaws revealed in the new WikiLeaks trove of C.I.A. documents would necessarily have gone through this process, and the committee would not have reviewed the tools, or software techniques, used to exploit a vulnerability. But Mr. Daniel said that all the appropriate agencies, including the C.I.A., participated in this process. That suggests that using at least some of the vulnerabilities exposed by WikiLeaks would have required White House approval. A new RAND Corporation study concludes that these zero day exploits, and the vulnerabilities they are based on, last longer than most thought. It found that the average vulnerability had a life expectancy of 6.9 years before it became useless to hackers. Brian White, the chief operating officer of RedOwl Analytics, a cybersecurity firm, said the companies were caught between conflicting pressures, especially if some of their employees have security clearances to work on government contracts.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   If you are holding a security clearance and you engage in the movement or sharing of this data, you could have your clearance revoked, he said. But he said that companies like Apple and Google also had a responsibility to their shareholders and customers to make their products as safe as possible. The likelihood of prosecution is much less important than understanding any vulnerability in their products, he said. In addition to the legal quandary, dealing with Mr. Assange, a mercurial personality who is considered a criminal by some people and a hero by others, is fraught with political complications. While WikiLeaks has often been criticized for releasing sensitive data without regard for the consequences, Mr. Assange is acting responsibly this time, said Jennifer Granick, the director of civil liberties at the Stanford Center for Internet and Society. WikiLeaks redacted the actual computer code for C.I.A. exploits from its initial release to avoid spreading such cyberweapons. He is trying to do the right thing, Ms. Granick said. She said that the legal risk to companies using the leaked information to fix their products is minimal, but that the government could make it easy by sharing more information about the vulnerabilities directly with the companies. Paul Kocher, a cryptographer who was previously an executive at the chip company Rambus, said that helping companies patch security holes was accepted practice in the industry. There are lots of things at WikiLeaks that are ethically questionable, Mr. Kocher said. But the normal thing to do if you come across vulnerabilities, regardless of whos using them, is to help them get fixed.   Scott Shane and David E.

Officials have not ruled out the possibility that the leaker was an agency employee.   Credit Doug Mills/The New York Times     WASHINGTON  The C.I.A. scrambled on Wednesday to assess and contain the damage from the release by WikiL eaks of thousands of documents that cataloged the agencys cyberspying capabilities, temporarily halting work on some projects while the F.B.I. turned to finding who was responsible for the leak. Investigators say that the leak was the work not of a hostile foreign power like Russia but of a disaffected insider, as WikiLeaks suggested when it released the documents Tuesday. The F.B.I. was preparing to interview anyone who had access to the information, a group likely to include at least a few hundred people, and possibly more than a thousand. An intelligence official said the information, much of which appeared to be technical documents, may have come from a server outside the C.I.A. managed by a contractor. But neither he nor a former senior intelligence official ruled out the possibility that the leaker was a C.I.A. employee. The officials spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss an ongoing investigation into classified information. The C.I.A. has refused to explicitly confirm the authenticity of the documents, but it all but said they were genuine Wednesday when it took the unusual step of putting out a statement to defend its work and chastise WikiLeaks.

He added that the C.I.A. is legally prohibited from spying on individuals in the United States and does not do so.  Continue reading the main story         Advertisement   Continue reading the main story       The leak was perhaps most awkward for the White House , which found itself criticizing WikiLeaks less than six months after the group published embarrassing emails from John D. Podesta, the campaign chairman for Hillary Clinton, prompting President Trump to declare at the time, I love WikiLeaks. Sean Spicer, the White House spokesman, said the release of documents should be something that everybody is outraged about in this country.  Video   Julian Assange on New C.I.A. Leaks    The founder of WikiLeaks, Julian Assange, said the Central Intelligence Agency lost control of a large arsenal of cyberwarfare tools and then covered up that the material was not secured.

Watch in Times Video          embed            There was, he added, a massive, massive difference between the leak of classified C.I.A. cyberspying tools and personal emails of political figures. The documents, taken at face value, suggest that American spies had designed hacking tools that could breach almost anything connected to the internet  smartphones, computers, televisions  and had even found a way to compromise Apple and Android devices. But whether the C.I.A. had successfully built and employed them to conduct espionage remained unclear on Wednesday. A number of cybersecurity experts and hackers expressed skepticism at the level of technical wizardry that WikiLeaks claimed to uncover, and pointed out that much of what was described in the documents was aimed at older devices that have known security flaws. One document, for instance, discussed ways to quickly copy 3.5-inch floppy disks, a storage device so out of date that few people younger than 35 have probably used one. One indication that the documents did not contain information on the most highly sensitive C.I.A. cyberespionage programs was that none of them appeared to be classified above the level of secret/noforn, which is a relatively low-level of classification. Some technical experts pointed out that while the documents suggest that the C.I.A. might be able to compromise individual smartphones, there was no evidence that the agency could break the encryption that many phone and messaging apps use.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   If the C.I.A. or the National Security Agency could routinely break the encryption used on such apps as Signal, Confide, Telegram and WhatsApp, then the government might be able to intercept such communications on a large scale and search for names or keywords of interest. But nothing in the leaked C.I.A. documents suggests that is possible. Instead, the documents indicate that because of encryption, the agency must target an individual phone and then can intercept only the calls and messages that pass through that phone. Instead of casting a net for a big catch, in other words, C.I.A. spies essentially cast a single fishing line at a specific target, and do not try to troll an entire population. The difference between wholesale surveillance and targeted surveillance is huge, said Dan Guido, a director at Hack/Secure, a cybersecurity investment firm. Instead of sifting through a sea of information, theyre forced to look at devices one at a time.

Theyre using standard tools, reading the same tech sites and blogs that I read, he said. Some of the vulnerabilities described by the C.I.A. have already been remedied, he said: The holes have been plugged. But Joel Brenner, formerly the countrys top counterintelligence official, said he believed the leak was a big deal because it would assist other countries that were trying to catch up to the United States, Russia, China and Israel in electronic spying. He added that the intelligence agencies would have to again assess the advisability of sharing secrets widely inside their walls. If something is shared with hundreds or thousands of people, theres a sense in which its already no longer a secret, he said. The WikiLeaks release included 7,818 web pages with 943 attachments. Many were partly redacted by the group, which said it wanted to to avoid disclosing the code for the tools.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   But without the code, it was hard to assess just what WikiLeaks had obtained  and what it was sitting on. The documents indicated that the C.I.A. sought to break into Apple, Android and Windows devices  that is, the vast majority of the worlds smartphones, tablets and computers. While the scale and nature of the C.I.A. documents appeared to catch government officials by surprise, there had been some signs a document dump was imminent. On Twitter, the organization had flagged for weeks that something big, under the WikiLeaks label Vault 7, was coming soon.   What is #Vault7 ? pic.twitter.com/PrjBU0LSAF

Credit Al Drago/The New York Times     WASHINGTON  If Dan Coats, President Trumps nominee to serve as the director of national intelligence, had any illusions about what he was getting into, the past seven weeks have certainly made clear the challenges he will face in a job created after the Sept. 11 attacks to coordinate the activities of the entire intelligence community. Mr. Coats, 73, a former senator from Indiana, has already had to fend off a move by Stephen K. Bannon, Mr. Trumps chief strategist, and Jared Kushner, the presidents son-in-law, to bring in a New York private equity billionaire to run a White House review of the intelligence community  a plan that Mr. Coats and many senior intelligence officials saw as a White House attempt to curtail their independence and reduce the flow of information that contradicts the presidents worldview. Once confirmed  the Senate intelligence committee voted on Thursday to send his nomination to the full Senate  Mr. Coats will face a far trickier political balancing act. He will be overseeing the same intelligence agencies that are examining Russias meddling in the election and possible ties between the Trump campaign and Moscow, while also trying to assuage Mr. Trumps deep distrust of the nations spies. It is an extraordinarily difficult job, particularly in the current environment, said Senator Susan Collins, Republican of Maine and a member of the intelligence committee. But she said she was confident that Mr. Coats would know how to manage the Trump White House.

At his confirmation hearing last week, Mr. Coats signaled that he would push forward with the intelligence communitys own inquiry into Russian meddling, and would cooperate with separate Senate and House investigations. I think its our responsibility to provide you access to all that you need, he said. He added that Russian meddling needs to be investigated. But how much influence Mr. Coats will have in his job remains an open question. He was not part of the Trump campaign  his tie to the administration is through Vice President Mike Pence, the former governor of Indiana  and it appears that at least some of Mr. Trumps closest advisers would prefer to have a reliable ally overseeing the intelligence community. Until last week, the White House was weighing a plan to bring in Stephen A. Feinberg , a co-founder of Cerberus Capital Management and a friend of Mr. Bannon and Mr. Kushner, to lead a White House review of the intelligence community. Stiff resistance from Mr. Coats and Mike Pompeo, the director of the Central Intelligence Agency  aided by pushback from allies in the Senate and even Mr. Pence  appears to have derailed the plan. Mr. Feinberg is now in discussions with administration officials to take on a still-undetermined role in defense, rather than intelligence, according to several people familiar with the matter. But Mr. Coats had little time to savor that triumph before Mr. Trump posted a series of Twitter messages early Saturday morning accusing former President Barack Obama, without any evidence, of wire tapping him during the 2016 presidential campaign. Mr. Trumps accusation was denied by a spokesman for Mr. Obama and by James R. Clapper Jr., the former director of national intelligence. The F.B.I. director, James B. Comey, unsuccessfully pressed the Justice Department to issue a denial.

Still, Mr. Coats comes to the agency with less experience in intelligence matters than any previous national intelligence director. He served as a congressman from Indiana before retiring from politics in 1998 after it became apparent that he would probably lose his re-election race. After working as a lobbyist, Mr. Coats was appointed ambassador to Germany by President George W. Bush, who also considered him for secretary of defense. He resigned as ambassador in 2005 and then returned to lobbying, joining the firm of King & Spalding, where he earned more than $600,000 a year and did work directly related to the intelligence community. He represented Sprint, the telecommunications firm, when the Bush administration was pushing Congress to expand the governments surveillance powers under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act , The Associated Press reported this year. As part of the legislation, Sprint and other telecommunication companies won legal immunity against lawsuits for their collaboration with the National Security Agency on its warrantless wiretapping program, which had been secretly approved by President Bush after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks. In 2010, Mr. Coats ran again for his old Senate seat. He defeated the man who had replaced him 12 years earlier, Evan Bayh, serving one term before retiring again in 2016. In November, Mr. Trump appointed him to the national intelligence job. While waiting to be confirmed, Mr. Coats has had to contend with the possibility of being usurped by Mr. Feinberg even before taking up the new job. Mr. Coats saw Mr. Feinbergs potential appointment as an effort by Mr. Bannon and Mr. Kushner to undercut him, according to current and former officials. He believed Mr. Feinbergs review would interfere with his ability to fulfill his role coordinating activities of the intelligence community.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   Intelligence officials also feared that Mr. Feinbergs review would merely be a steppingstone before he was placed into one of the top positions in the intelligence community. Mr. Bannon and Mr. Kushner also reportedly considered him for either director of national intelligence or chief of the C.I.A.s clandestine service, a role normally reserved for career intelligence officers. Mr. Trump was apparently unaware of the fierce resistance within the intelligence community to the proposal until the planned appointment was reported last month. Sen. Richard Burr, the powerful chairman of the Senate intelligence committee, was also not aware of the proposal until then, officials said. Faced with opposition to the plan, Mr. Trump played down the possibility of the appointment when asked about it at a lengthy news conference on Feb. 16. Mr. Trump said that Mr. Feinberg was a very talented man, very successful man but that he was not needed at this time because of the fact that, you know, I think that we are going to be able to straighten it out very easily on its own.

Credit Doug Mills/The New York Times     President Trumps claim on Twitter early Saturday that he had just found out that President Obama was tapping my phones in October, an accusation for which he offered no evidence, has set off another spasm surrounding his young administration. On Sunday, Mr. Trumps spokesman said the administration was asking Congress to investigate the presidents allegation. There is ample reason for caution because Mr. Trump has a history of making attention-grabbing and politically explosive claims that have no basis in fact. As things stand, a plausible explanation is that Mr. Trump was merely riffing off a March 3 article on the alt-right website Breitbart.com. It laid out a theory circulating in some conservative circles that President Barack Obama sought to sabotage Mr. Trump through surveillance. The episode has heightened interest in several related surveillance issues. Can a president order the wiretapping of an American? Not legally. There are two lawful ways that allow government officials to target people in the United States for surveillance and to collect the contents of their phone calls and emails: criminal wiretaps, called Title III warrants, and national security wiretaps, called Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, or FISA, orders. Both types of wiretapping are ordered by federal judges, after applications from the Justice Department.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   If there was a wiretap order targeting Mr. Trump or his associates, what would that mean? If it was a criminal wiretap, it would mean that the Justice Department had gathered sufficient evidence to convince a federal judge that someone using the phone number or email address probably committed a serious crime. If it was a national security wiretap, it would mean a federal judge on the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court had a basis to believe the target was probably an agent of a foreign power, like Russia.  Continue reading the main story         Advertisement   Continue reading the main story       Could a judge have approved tapping something at Trump Tower for another reason? Yes. For example, FISA orders have two parts. After determining that there is probable cause to believe that the target is a foreign agent, a judge also has to approve directing surveillance at a particular facility, like a phone line or an email address, that the target is probably using to communicate. So in theory, if there was reason to believe that some other lawful target was communicating from Trump Tower, a judge could have authorized surveillance at a facility there for that reason. What about the computer server registered to Trump Tower? Several news media outlets have reported that investigators last year were puzzled by data transmissions between a computer server registered to Trump Tower and a computer server associated with a Russian bank. Although Mr. Trump on Twitter talked about his phones, in theory a judge might determine that the computer address of the server was a facility being used by a foreign power, Russia, to communicate, and authorize surveillance of it.

See Sample  Manage Email Preferences  Not you?  Privacy Policy  Opt out or contact us anytime      Isnt there a report about an October surveillance court order involving that server? Yes. The Breitbart story relied heavily on a Nov. 7 article by a British writer on the news and opinion website HeatStreet. It claimed that the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court had approved a warrant in October in connection with activity between Russian banks and the server, which it said  and Breitbart repeated  was in Trump Tower. It further stated that it is thought in the intelligence community that this purported warrant permitted the collection of emails and other communications of Americans connected to the server investigation, which thus covers Donald Trump. As things stand, there are reasons to be skeptical. HeatStreet had vague sourcing  two sources with links to the counterintelligence community  and it does not regularly publish investigative stories about American intelligence or law enforcement operations. To date, reporters for The New York Times with demonstrated sources in that world have been unable to corroborate that the court issued any such order. (Computer specialists have also pointed out that the server in question does not appear to be located in Trump Tower.) On Sunday, James Clapper, who was the director of national intelligence until Jan. 20, denied to NBC News that the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court had approved monitoring at Trump Tower. What about wiretapping Michael Flynns calls with the Russian ambassador? In a related matter, some conservatives have raised alarms about why the government eavesdropped on the late-December phone calls about sanctions between the Russian ambassador and Michael Flynn, who resigned last month as Mr. Trumps national security adviser. But national security specialists say it is routine that counterintelligence officials would monitor the Russian ambassador, who is a clearly an agent of a foreign power, and so would incidentally pick up Mr. Flynn, too. The rules generally require officials to minimize the privacy intrusion by masking the names and data of incidentally intercepted Americans before sharing reports or transcripts of those calls more widely within the government. However, there is an exception if the conversation constituted foreign intelligence and the Americans identity is necessary to understand its significance, as would be the case with Mr. Flynns discussion of sanctions . Did Obama loosen rules for sharing surveillance? Yes. In January, the Obama administration changed the rules governing how the National Security Agency may share raw surveillance it intercepts abroad, where the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act does not apply and the agency may vacuum up private communications in bulk. Previously, only analysts at the agency were permitted to search through the raw trove of this information, applying minimization rules to information about Americans before sharing anything more widely in the government. Now, analysts from the other 16 intelligence agencies  including the F.B.I.  can sift through certain streams of raw intercepts themselves, applying minimization rules afterward. Some conservative commentators, like Fox Newss Sean Hannity , have floated the theory that news media leaks about contacts between people affiliated with Mr. Trump and Russians may be attributable to this change , asking why Mr. Obama opened the door to many more officials across the government having access to raw National Security Agency intercepts. Several factors complicate that insinuation. The change did not affect collection on American soil under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, which several agencies were already able to share in raw form. Moreover, the recent change had been in the works for years. President George W. Bush set it in motion in 2008, and the bureaucratic deliberations were well developed long before it became clear that Mr. Trump would become president.   Correction: March 6, 2017   An earlier version of this article incorrectly referred to HeatStreet as a British blog. The HeatStreet article in question was written by HeatStreets then-editor, who is British, but the website is based in New York. This article has also been updated to clarify that a server that attracted investigators suspicions is registered to Trump Tower but appears not to be located there.

Cache Image Credit Wesley Bedrosian By  Zeynep Tufekci March 9, 2017 On Tuesday morning, WikiLeaks released an enormous cache of documents that it claimed detailed C.I.A. hacking tools. Immediately afterward, it posted two startling tweets asserting that C.I.A. hacker malware  posed a threat to journalists and others who require secure communication by infecting iPhone and Android devices and bypassing encrypted message apps such as Signal and WhatsApp. This appeared to be a bombshell. Signal is considered the gold standard for secure communication. WhatsApp has a billion users. The C.I.A., it seemed, had the capacity to conduct sweeping surveillance on what we had previously assumed were our safest and most private digital conversations. In their haste to post articles about the release, almost all the leading news organizations took the WikiLeaks tweets at face value. Their initial accounts mentioned Signal, WhatsApp and other encrypted apps by name, and described them as bypassed or otherwise compromised by the C.I.A.s cyberspying tools. Yet on closer inspection, this turned out to be misleading. Neither Signal nor WhatsApp, for example, appears by name in any of the alleged C.I.A. files in the cache. (Using automated tools to search the whole database, as security researchers subsequently did, turned up no hits.) More important, the hacking methods described in the documents do not, in fact, include the ability to bypass such encrypted apps  at least not in the sense of bypass that had seemed so alarming. Indeed, if anything, the C.I.A. documents in the cache confirm the strength of encryption technologies. What had gone wrong? There were two culprits: an honest (if careless) misunderstanding about technology on the part of the press; and yet another shrewd misinformation campaign orchestrated by WikiLeaks. Lets start with the technology. In the aftermath of Edward J. Snowdens revelations about potential mass surveillance, there has been a sharp increase in the use of these end to end encryption apps, which render even the company that owns the app or phone essentially unable to read or hear the communications between the two end users. Given that entities like Signal and WhatsApp cannot get access to the content of these conversations, even in response to a warrant  WhatsApp keeps logs of who talked to whom, Signal doesnt do even that  intelligence agencies have been looking to develop techniques for hacking into individual phones. That way, they could see the encrypted communications just as individual users of the apps would. These techniques are what the leaked cache revealed. Security experts I spoke with, however, stressed that these techniques appear to be mostly known methods  some of them learned from academic and other open conferences  and that there were no big surprises or unexpected wizardry. In other words, the cache reminds us that if your phone is hacked, the Signal or WhatsApp messages on it are not secure. This should not come as a surprise. If an intelligence agency, or a nosy sibling, can get you to install, say, a key logger on your phone, either one can bypass the encrypted communication app. But so can someone looking over your shoulder while you use your phone. That is about the vulnerability of your device. It has nothing to do with the security of the apps. If anything in the WikiLeaks revelations is a bombshell, it is just how strong these encrypted apps appear to be. Since it doesnt have a means of easy mass surveillance of such apps, the C.I.A. seems to have had to turn its attention to the harder and often high-risk task of breaking into individual devices one by one. Which brings us to WikiLeaks misinformation campaign. An accurate tweet accompanying the cache would have said something like, If the C.I.A. goes after your specific phone and hacks it, the agency can look at its content. But that, of course, wouldnt have caused alarm and defeatism about the prospects of secure conversations. Weve seen WikiLeaks do this before. Last July, right after the attempted coup in Turkey, WikiLeaks promised, with much fanfare, to release emails belonging to Turkeys ruling Justice and Development Party. What WikiLeaks ultimately released, however, was nothing but mundane mailing lists of tens of thousands of ordinary people who discussed politics online. Back then, too, the ruse worked: Many Western journalists had hyped these non-leaks. WikiLeaks seems to have a playbook for its disinformation campaigns. The first step is to dump many documents at once  rather than allowing journalists to scrutinize them and absorb their significance before publication. The second step is to sensationalize the material with misleading news releases and tweets. The third step is to sit back and watch as the news media unwittingly promotes the WikiLeaks agenda under the auspices of independent reporting. The media, to its credit, eventually sorts things out  as it has belatedly started to do with the supposed C.I.A. cache. But by then, the initial burst of misinformation has spread. On social media in particular, the spin and distortion continues unabated. This time around, for example, there are widespread claims on social media that these leaked documents show that it was the C.I.A. that hacked the Democratic National Committee, and that it framed Russia for the hack. (The documents in the cache reveal nothing of the sort.) As with most misinformation campaigns, the dust that is kicked up obscures concerns over a real issue. Device and information insecurity, overzealous surveillance by governments  these are real concerns that call for real attention. Yes, we need to have extensive and thoughtful discussion of these topics. But thats not what the WikiLeaks misinformation campaign has given us.
