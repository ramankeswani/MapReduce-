The original caption reads: Greg Grey Cloud and a group of Lakota riders confront North Dakota police after the Dakota Access Pipeline project received full government approval. Daniella Zalcman is the photographer, and she provided this additional information to The Times: The ceremony was part of a traditional horse presentation, and entirely peaceful, though they did manage to push the police line back to the other side of the entrance to the construction site. Over the course of the next several months, the protest swelled to a camp of as many as 8,000, with Indigenous representatives coming from as far away as New Zealand, Norway and the Amazon to express solidarity. In December, the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe won a major victory in its battle to block the pipeline being built near its reservation when the Department of the Army announced that it would not allow the pipeline to be drilled under a dammed section of the Missouri River. However, President Trump supports the construction of the pipeline, and on Feb. 7, the Army announced it would allow the project to move forward, paving the way for an infrastructure project that has been surrounded by protest and controversy.

(Her cellphone quacks for incoming calls. Everyone is upset by that, but it makes sure that I hear it, she said.)  Which is not to suggest that she is insensible to the changes brewing in the fashion industry, citing the ever-increasing pace as one of the reasons for leaving her full-time Vogue position.  There are just so many designers, she said. Seems like theres too many. Certainly too many fashion shows. I cant really see where its going  on a website, isnt it?

A film crew from Sky Sports had joined Michael van Gerwen in Oldham on Friday to have him pantomime and pose in front of a green screen for a series of television spots.

What is it with the relationship between people and things, anyway  this human drive to have more and more? Collecting can, of course, be practical: Libraries and museums are valuable utilities. Ego, personal and political, is a familiar motivator: I own much, therefore I am much.

A meeting with Club Brugge, of course, was hardly the sort of achingly glamorous meeting Leicester had craved for the clubs first-ever game in the Champions League.

The answers they gave me were satisfying in the extreme: not very much, just kick back, hang out, look things over, take it slow. It was 1974. Thats what you were supposed to say.  ... So, what are you doing after graduation? Thirty-five years later, a college teacher, I ask my students the old question. They arent inclined to dissimulate now. The culture is on their side when they tell me about law school and med school and higher degrees in journalism and business; or when they talk about a research grant in China or a well-paying gig teaching English in Japan. _________   Think you know dissimulate?

You can be the longest shot in the history of Oscar nominees, he said. You still have to think you have the teeniest, tiniest, half-percentage-point chance of winning walking into that room.  Mr. Quenqua, who has worked on numerous Oscar campaigns, including one for The Help, said that there are multiple reasons that long-shot contenders cling to hope. Aside from ego  and dont underestimate that factor in Hollywood  actors and actresses, from their earliest days auditioning, dont make it very far if they have a defeatist attitude. Upsets from past Oscars can also contribute to magical thinking; nobody thought voters would select Marisa Tomei as best supporting actress in 1993 for her gum-smacking girlfriend in My Cousin Vinny, but they did. _________   Think you know defeatist?

Its singer, Eno Williams, is at center.   Credit Renan Peron     It didnt matter what she was singing; the words just sounded good. That was the genesis of Ibibio Sound Machine , a London band that releases its second album, Uyai, on Friday. Uyai (beauty in the Nigerian language Ibibio) is an album full of positive-thinking songs and deep, inventive grooves that hotwire decades of African, European and American music. Western pop fans will hear echoes of Michael Jackson, James Brown, Gary Numan, Prince, Talking Heads and, yes, Miami Sound Machine; African music devotees will recognize threads of juju and Afrobeat from Nigeria, high life from Ghana and makossa from Cameroon. Eno Williams, the bands singer, was born in London but grew up in Nigeria before returning to England. Most of the time she sings in her ancestral language, Ibibio, from southern Nigeria. The bands guitarist is from Ghana, its drummer from Trinidad, its percussionist from Brazil and its saxophonist and producer from Australia. Where some world music bands seek exotic hybrids but end up settling for the lowest common denominator, Ibibio Sound Machine is a global coalition that builds a true synergy. Ibibio Sound Machine grew out of Londons determined coterie of Africaphile musicians. It was sparked when Max Grunhard, an Australian saxophonist and producer who led an Afro-funk band called KonKoma , heard Ms. Williams singing in Ibibio. The language has ups and downs, its got dips, it sounds very rhythmic, Ms. Williams said in a Skype interview from the bands London studio. I remember singing just a phrase of one of the stories I got told as a child, and immediately he picked up on the fact that it was really rhythmic and it was unique and different. Mr. Grunhard and other KonKoma members, including the Ghanaian guitarist Alfred Kari Bannerman, started assembling songs with Ms. Williams, initially looking toward vintage African pop. They gathered other musicians, including Anselmo Netto, a percussionist from Brazil. When Ms. Williams first heard him, he was playing a talking drum, an instrument used in Yoruba music from Nigeria that can mimic the syllables of speech, sometimes playing a running commentary on the lyrics.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   He played a talking drum like a Yoruba person, Ms. Williams said. It immediately, it literally spoke something to my heart. And then, through our conversations, talking and exchanging music, I found out that hes got family that actually speaks Yoruba, that probably migrated from Nigeria, although he had never been to Nigeria. She added, Its the universal nature of music, the fact that the world is getting smaller because were all connected musically.  Continue reading the main story         Advertisement   Continue reading the main story       They assembled an albums worth of material, and were trying to decide on a band name when someone jokingly suggested Ibibio Sound Machine. It stuck. Ms. Williams is happy to acknowledge that shes a fan of Gloria Estefans old band, Miami Sound Machine. They had all that African percussion, and that just got my body moving, she said. Many of the songs on Ibibio Sound Machine, the bands debut album, were based on Ibibio folk tales  including one about a talking fish  set to tracks that meshed African and American funk, with scrubbing guitars and a snappy horn section.

Styles are cross-pollinated; the tone can be meditative, as in Quiet, or frenetic, as in Trance Dance. Although the songs generally started with band members jamming together, they also have an electronic overlay, a new willingness to flaunt the possibilities of the studio. The songs also address the present; in the tradition of much African music, they make themselves the conscience of a community. Passing on culture, passing on morals, thats the backbone of the Ibibio culture, Ms. Williams said. A song or story always had a meaning. In Lullaby, a woman sings her child to sleep with admonitions on virtue. In The Chant, a woman reaches back to a chant she heard as a child to carry her through fearful moments. The utterly danceable Give Me a Reason, which opens the album with a punchy, upbeat hybrid of funk, synth-pop and makossa, is about the Nigerian schoolgirls abducted in 2014 by Boko Haram. It struck a chord in me, Ms. Williams said. Why couldnt children be given the opportunity to go to school? And then theres a bigger picture: Why cant we just be free to be who we want to be? But on the other hand, we wanted it to be upbeat  we wanted it to be a hopeful song. We just want to make people aware that despite the doom and gloom, there is something that can lift you up.   Its the universal nature of music, the fact that the world is getting smaller because were all connected musically.

Update, May 18 , 2017: We have published the winners of the 2017 Student Editorial Contest . _________  Is Social Media Making Us More Narcissistic?  Do Teachers Assign Too Much Homework?  Should the Drinking Age Be Lowered? Every day during the school year we invite teenagers to share their opinions about questions like these  on topics from reality TV to the justice system  and hundreds do, posting arguments, reflections and anecdotes to our Student Opinion feature. Now, for the fourth year in a row, were inviting you to channel that enthusiasm into something a little more formal: short, evidence-based persuasive essays like the editorials The New York Times publishes every day.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   The challenge is pretty straightforward. Choose a topic you care about, gather evidence from sources both within and outside of The New York Times, and write a concise editorial (450 words or less) to convince readers of your point of view.  Continue reading the main story         Advertisement   Continue reading the main story       Because editorial writing at newspapers is a collaborative process , you can write your entry as a team effort or by yourself. When youre done, post it in the contest form below by April 4, 2017, at 11:59 p.m. Eastern. With our judges, we will then use this rubric (PDF) for selecting winners to publish on The Learning Network. As teachers know, the persuasive essay has long been a staple of high school education, but the Common Core standards seem to have put evidence-based argumentative writing on everybodys agenda. You couldnt ask for a more real-world example of the genre than the classic newspaper editorial  and The Times publishes, on average, four of them a day. And at a time when breaking out of ones filter bubble is more important than ever, we hope this contest also encourages students to broaden their news diets by using multiple sources, ideally ones that offer a range of perspectives on their chosen issue. So what issue do you care about? Gun violenc e ? Sexism ? Animal testing ? You decide, but here are 401 writing prompts that might give you ideas, and here is a link to last years winners so you can see what were looking for. Good luck, and please post any questions you might have in the comments and well answer you there. _________  Video   How to Write an Editorial    The New York Timess editorial page editor Andrew Rosenthal provides seven tips for writing an effective editorial.  By Jason Spingarn-Koff on Publish Date February 5, 2014.  .  Watch in Times Video          embed            To help with this challenge, Andrew Rosenthal, in his previous role as Editorial Page editor of The Times, detailed seven pointers in the video above. And we published two related lesson plans,  For the Sake of Argument: Writing Persuasively to Craft Short, Evidence-Based Editorials  and  I Dont Think So: Writing Effective Counterarguments  that offer additional teaching ideas.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   We have also culled a list of 401 prompts for argumentative writing organized by category, to help inspire you  although, of course, you are not limited to those topics. We encourage you to look at both our comments on last years winners and the winning essays themselves . They can serve as excellent models, and they cover topics from 3-D printing to Guantanamo Bay . _________ Rules 1. Use at least one Times source. You can write your editorial about any topic, as long as you use at least one source from The New York Times. That should pretty much open the whole world to you, as you may be surprised how much you can find in The Times . Be advised that NYTimes.com has a digital subscription system in which readers have access to 10 free articles each month, but after that you will be asked to become a digital subscriber. However, all Times articles linked from The Learning Network, as well as The Learning Network itself (with the exception of lesson plans) are free . That means you can use any of the articles linked from this site for the editorial contest without exceeding the 10-article limit. (The Times has also introduced a new K-12 subscription plan , which covers digital access schoolwide.) 2. Use at least one non-Times source. Make sure, however, that the source you use is a reliable one. We encourage you to find sources that offer different perspectives on an issue. 3. Always cite your sources. Our submission form contains a required field for entering your citations. We include an example as well. Even if you use a print source or an expert interview, you must cite your sources. Readers (and judges) should always know where you got your evidence. 4. Be concise. The editorial must be no more than 450 words. Your title and list of sources are separate, however, and do not count as part of your 450-word limit. 5. Have an opinion. Editorials are different from news articles because they try to persuade readers to share your point of view. Dont be afraid to take a stand.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   6. Write your editorial by yourself or with a group. If you are working as a team, just remember to submit all of your names when you post your entry. However, please submit only one editorial per student. If youre submitting as part of a team, you should not also submit as an individual. 7. Be original and use appropriate language. Write for a well-informed audience, but include enough background information to give context. Be careful not to plagiarize: Use quotation marks around lines you use verbatim from another source, or rephrase and cite your source. 8. Submissions must be from students who are 13 to 19 years old, although students can come from anywhere in the world. Unlike in previous years, students can now use their entire name if they want. 9. All entries must be submitted by April 4, 2017 , at 11:59 p.m. Eastern time using the contest form above. If you have questions about the contest, please feel free to post them in the comments section as well, and well answer you there. 10. Follow these instructions if you need proof that you entered this contest. Within an hour of submitting your editorial, you should receive an email from The New York Times with the subject heading Thank you for your submission to our Student Editorial Contest. If you dont receive the email within an hour, even after checking your spam folder, then you can resubmit your entry. Be sure your settings allow emails from nytimes.com. After two attempts and waiting over one full day, if you still have not received a confirmation email, you can email us at LNFeedback@nytimes.com using the email address you used in the contest form with the subject heading Please send me an email confirmation for my editorial contest submission. Be sure to include your name and editorial title (or subject) in your email. You may have to wait up to one week for a reply. 11. We will use this rubric (PDF) to judge entries,  and the winning editorials will be featured on The Learning Network. _________ Additional Resources Suggested by Teachers Writing an Editorial Unit Plan by Lindsay Thompson   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   Reader Idea | He Said, She Said, I Say: A Researched Argument Essay by Danielle Harms Reader Idea | Using an Op-Doc Video to Teach Argumentative Writing by Allison Marchetti   Reader Idea | Using Room for Debate to Teach Argumentative Writing and Discussion Skills by Gerard Dawson and Justin Rex Reader Idea | An Argument-Writing Unit: Crafting Student Editorials by Kayleen Everitt Good luck and have fun.
