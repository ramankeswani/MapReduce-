Credit Cadillac     The Cadillac CTS is racing toward a blind corner, raising the anxiety of its passengers. Suddenly, a chime sounds and a front cross traffic alert warning flashes on a screen attached to the windshield. Even though theres nothing visible ahead, the driver jams on the brakes  just as another Cadillac CTS jumps out from around the corner. Disaster averted. This near miss is all for show  a demonstration of vehicle-to-vehicle, or V2V, communications . Vehicle-to-vehicle systems broadcast a cars position, speed and other information, such as windshield wiper activation, to other cars in the vicinity. In the test, conducted in a closed parking lot, a building obstructed the view so neither the driver nor the various camera and radar sensors in the car could detect the other Cadillac. But thanks to V2V communications, the drivers were warned in advance. The beauty of this is it doesnt have to see the other vehicle, Matthew Kirsch, engineer group manager for automated driving and active safety at Cadillac, said in an interview. And it can communicate with many different vehicles ahead. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration estimates that up to 80 percent of crashes not attributed to driver impairment could be eliminated or mitigated by V2V devices. The agency plans to require that future cars and light trucks include the hardware for dedicated short-range communications devices . The devices will use a portion of the broadcast spectrum that is set aside specifically for this purpose.

Im happy the U.S. government is pushing the regulation, said Lars Reger, chief technology officer of NXP Semiconductors automotive business unit . Its a big catalyst.  Continue reading the main story         Advertisement   Continue reading the main story       General Motors isnt waiting for the final mandate. It just announced that, starting this month, its 2017 Cadillac CTS will be the first car to use short-range communication for alerts between vehicles up to 1,000 feet apart. The warnings will include alarms about disabled cars and vehicles that are braking hard ahead, as well as slippery road conditions. The trouble is, only other Cadillac CTS drivers with the same system will see the alerts. BMW and Mercedes-Benz find themselves in similar circumstances. Both companies offer hazard warning systems on certain models, but they can communicate only with specific car models with identical systems. Furthermore, BMW and Mercedes do not use the short-range technology but rely instead on existing cellular networks to transmit alerts. Some automakers, as well as wireless carriers and chip makers, think that cellular systems will be better suited to handling vehicle-to-vehicle communications in the future. And, they say, cellular networks can handle connections to devices like smart traffic lights, tolls and other parts of the transportation infrastructure  so-called vehicle-to-everything or V2X communications. Most of these companies have their eyes on future 5G networks, which promise more capacity and broadband connections 10 times faster than is available today.

Credit Qualcomm Technologies    You have to consider the scale aspect, said Nakul Duggal, who manages the automotive portfolio for Qualcomm . How do you do it with street furniture  signs and traffic lights  in future smart cities? Cellular networks can also share information about traffic situations miles ahead. Jaguar Land Rover is working with a Chicago-based start-up, HAAS Alert , to explore delivering automatic warnings about emergency vehicles to other drivers. We want people to know 40 to 50 seconds ahead, said Cory James Hohs, chief executive of HAAS, so were using whats available today, and thats cellular. Not only could drivers be warned about ambulances, for example, but they could also get alerts about trains at crossings. As of today, there is no official 5G specification, and Mr. Duggal does not expect to see a substantial transition from 4G to 5G systems until 2022 or 2023.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   Engineers have been working for over a decade on specifications for dedicated short-range communications devices. Tests last year in Michigan with more than a half-dozen major automakers helped persuade the national highway agency to push for new regulations. Harman, a unit of Samsung that supplies communications equipment to automakers, says some car companies have expressed interest in using dedicated short-range communications, or D.S.R.C., devices, while others are taking a more passive approach. I dont know if N.H.T.S.A. itself can be the catalyst, said Mike Tzamaloukas, vice president for navigation technologies at Harman, but they can make it more urgent. With Wi-Fi already in many connected cars, the short-range systems may be less of a stretch because the specification and its radio frequencies are essentially an extension of Wi-Fi. That may help keep down the cost of adding the capability to new cars.  Photo        A rendering from Cadillac of an alert that a driver would see in a vehicle.   Credit Cadillac    By directly communicating between vehicles, the short-range systems are not slowed down by having to communicate with cellular base stations. They would also work in the large parts of rural America that do not have cellular service. Moreover, they could also be rolled out without any major infrastructure investments. Designers working on the forthcoming 5G specification point out that it now also includes direct vehicle-to-vehicle communications that do not depend on a separate cell network. Mr. Duggal of Qualcomm said such direct 5G communications should be up to twice as fast as dedicated short-range communications devices; that could prove critical in delivering warnings in some situations, such as when a driver is trying to pass a vehicle on a highway while another car is approaching from the opposite direction at 65 or 75 miles per hour. Wireless carriers also point out that 5G is a forward-looking platform that could be used to handle demanding, high-bandwidth applications like transmitting a video feed from a cars onboard camera to the internet to collect information about road conditions. Verizon has already begun to lay out its 5G plans, starting an 11-city test this year that will include Dallas, Denver, Sacramento and Washington, said Marc Tracey, a company spokesman.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   Ultimately, some combination of short-range and 5G communications may be necessary to make vehicle-to-vehicle connections work reliably. Both 5G and D.S.R.C. are fundamental to the current and future direction of in-car connectivity, said Barry Napier, chief executive of Cubic Telecom, which is working on connected car systems with companies like Audi. The value of dedicated short-range communications devices, according to Mr. Napier, is the exclusive focus on automotive safety, whereas 5G is intended to handle everything from voice to smart devices  and it is not expected to arrive until 2020, around the time autonomous vehicles are expected to make their debut. Cadillac says that V2V technology is important to the development of autonomous vehicles, pointing to the introduction of its Super Cruise semiautonomous option, expected this year. But improving driver safety now is the impetus behind introducing the short-range systems today. Thats why were not going to just wait until someone tells us we can do this, said Chris Bonelli, who handles communications for advanced technology at G.M. Theres a strong personal motivation for this, said Rupert Poole, senior collaborations manager for future technology at Jaguar Land Rover. When people ask, can we really expect to save lives with this, the answer is a resounding yes.

Credit Hiroko Masuike/The New York Times        Its easy to get giddy about self-driving cars. Older people and preteens will become more independent and mobile. The scourge of drunken driving will disappear. People will be able to safely play video games while on the freeway to work. But there is one problem autonomous driving is unlikely to solve: the columns of rush-hour gridlock that clog city streets and freeways. If decades of urban planning and economic research are any guide, the solution is unlikely to come from technology but from something similar to Ubers surge pricing: charging people more to use driverless cars at rush hour. Not that technology companies arent trying to find other solutions to congestion. Traffic is one of the few problems that fabulously wealthy people cant buy their way out of. This helps explain why Elon Musk, the founder of Tesla and SpaceX, wants to bore subterranean freeways under Los Angeles and build a hyperloop train half the length of California. Or why Larry Page, Googles co-founder, is interested in flying cars . This is in addition to other, less revolutionary efforts, from companies like Sidewalk Labs, which is owned by Googles parent company and which aims to ease congestion by helping cities make better use of data. And of course there is the self-driving car, which, in addition to making roads safer, is supposed to help manage freeways by smoothing human flaws  like a tendency to engage in antsy braking and sudden lane changes  that make traffic worse.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   These various technologies share a common theme. One way or another, they promise to expand the nations roads  literally, in the case of Mr. Musks tunnels, figuratively, in the case of flying cars, and efficiently, in the case of self-driving ones. While it is possible that one or all of these technologies will increase road capacity to the point at which no amount of traffic will fill them, history gives us reasons to be skeptical.  Continue reading the main story         Advertisement   Continue reading the main story       Decades worth of studies show that whenever cities add roads, new drivers simply fill them up. This isnt because of new development or population growth  although thats part of the story  but because of a vicious cycle in which new roads bring new demand that no amount of further roads can satisfy. This has been studied at rush hour , studied on individual freeway projects and studied with large data sets that encompass nearly every road in the United States. With remarkable consistency, the research finds the same thing: Whenever a road is built or an older road is widened, more people decide to drive more. Build more or widen further, and even more people decide to drive. Repeat to infinity. Economists call this latent demand, which is a fancy way of saying there are always more people who want to drive somewhere than there is space for them to do it. So far anyway, nothing cities have done to increase capacity has ever sped things up. The extent of this failure was chronicled in a 2011 paper called  The Fundamental Law of Road Congestion , by the economists Gilles Duranton, from the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania, and Matthew Turner, from Brown University. The two went beyond road building to show that increases in public transit and changes in land use  basically, building apartments next to office buildings so that more people can walk or bike to work  also fail to cut traffic (or do so only a little). This doesnt mean public transit and land planning are bad ideas, or that widening freeways is a bad idea. When roads are bigger, more people can get around. More people see family; more packages are delivered; more babies are lulled to sleep. It just means that none of those measures have done much to reduce commute times, and self-driving cars seem unlikely to either. Thats where charging people during busy times comes in. Maybe autonomous cars will be different from other capacity expansions, Mr. Turner said. But of the things we have observed so far, the only thing that really drives down travel times is pricing.

Only when the drive is far enough or the traffic is bad enough  or a taxi costs enough  will more people choose to bike, car-pool, hop on a train or postpone a trip. This same pattern shows up in all kinds of places. You can see it in car-centric cities like Los Angeles and Houston , where yearslong, multibillion dollar lane-widening projects did little to speed commutes.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   But you can also see it in New York  by far the most transit-friendly city in the United States. Ride-hailing services like Lyft and Uber have led to increased auto traffic, according to a February study from Schaller Consulting in Brooklyn, while subway trips dipped slightly in 2016 because of a fall in weekend usage. Bruce Schaller, principal of Schaller Consulting, said if the growth in ride-hailing services continued, it would inevitably push the city toward some sort of congestion pricing system, an idea New York has floated and rejected . There will be so many cars on the streets, and freight deliveries and buses and everyone else will be so slowed down, that people will get fed up and demand a solution, he said. And we have a solution in pricing. Things like matinee movies, red-eye airfares and happy hour drinks have accustomed Americans to the idea of variable pricing depending on time. But charging more for roads is toxic , at least in the United States. Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg met abject failure with his attempt at congestion pricing in New York. Yet London, Singapore and Stockholm have all put in such systems effectively. In the United States, the most common objection is that road pricing is regressive: Rich people get to drive alone while the masses huddle on a bus. Also, people just dont like paying for things that they are used to having free. Economists are hoping that may change. Several states, including California, Texas and Minnesota , have added high-occupancy toll lanes with different pricing during rush hours. This idea of congestion pricing is not completely dismissed the way it once was, said Clifford Winston, an economist at the Brookings Institution. Mr. Winston said the eventual introduction of self-driving cars would probably lessen consumer opposition to paying more to use roads during peak periods. Ride-hailing apps have taught consumers to accept surge pricing, and people are generally less resistant to paying for something new. The result would be something like variably priced lanes dedicated to fleets of robot vehicles.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   If that happens, one of the hidden benefits of this revolutionary new technology will be that it got people to accept an idea that economists started talking about at least a century ago .

Credit Ford     How do you create a map showing every road in the United States, with the precise location of every stop sign, all the lane markings, every exit ramp and every traffic light  and update it in real time as traffic is rerouted around construction and accidents? Thats a challenge that automakers and technology companies are confronting in their race to develop self-driving cars, the kind that someday will let you sit back and read or watch TV on the way to work each morning. The need for highly detailed, three-dimensional, computerized maps  which pinpoint a cars location and understand its surroundings  is often overlooked amid all the hype about autonomous vehicles. The chatter tends to focus more on the various sensors that enable cars to see the road and any obstacles in front of them. Those sensors include radar, cameras and a laser-based kind of radar known as lidar. But digital maps are an equally critical piece of the puzzle. If we want to have autonomous cars everywhere, we have to have digital maps everywhere, said Amnon Shashua, chief technology officer at Mobileye , an Israeli company that makes advanced vision systems for automobiles.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   Creating them, however, is a monumental task. There are more than four million miles of roads in the United States. And compared with the maps used by GPS and navigation systems, the level of precision must be much greater. Navigational maps typically locate a cars position within several yards. Digital maps for autonomous cars must know the locations of cars, curbs and other objects within about four inches.  Continue reading the main story         Advertisement   Continue reading the main story       So far the drive to create digital maps has been slow. Googles former self-driving car division  now a company called Waymo  has created maps for roads around its headquarters in Mountain View, Calif., and a handful of other cities, including Austin, Tex., and Kirkland, Wash. Waymo creates the maps by driving around cars equipped with spinning lidar units mounted on their roofs that shoot out laser beams, creating images of the road and the surroundings. Human engineers, in a time-consuming process, then go over the images and tag the objects that are found, like stop signs, buildings, stoplights and do-not-enter signs. The laser equipment needed to do this scanning is expensive  it can cost $100,000 or more to outfit just one car to do this job.            5 Things That Give Self-Driving Cars Headaches    Another company, Here , which was started by Nokia and then acquired by the German automakers BMW, Daimler and Audi, is also mapping roads in the United States and Europe. It is drawing on data scooped up by scanning systems that trucking companies have agreed to install on their vehicles. Here also has its own fleet of cars collecting images, and is working on algorithms to enable computers to annotate the maps. The effort may soon shift into higher gear, thanks to an idea borrowed from the internet that has helped in other fields: crowdsourcing. Mobileye supplies front-facing camera systems that enable cars to detect obstacles and brake to prevent or mitigate collisions. Starting with 2018 models, both Volkswagen and BMW will outfit their vehicles with Mobileye systems that can also transmit their precise locations and images of the roads they are traveling, which can be synthesized into one giant digital map. Mr. Shashua said his company expected to sign on many other automakers to do the same. You can leverage the fact that you will have millions of cars with cameras  almost all the new cars that hit the road, he said. This is a force multiplier. Others are thinking along the same lines. A technology start-up called Civil Maps is trying to develop its own image-vacuuming device and hopes to persuade automakers to install it in cars and trucks. The company is also working on artificial intelligence technology that it hopes will automate the annotating of maps  the other big technological challenge. Its work has attracted an investment from Ford Motor.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   For full autonomy, we believe we need to have a high-definition map of the area weve been operating in, a map annotated with what are the permanent fixed objects in that area, said Raj Nair, the global product development chief at Ford, which has vowed to begin producing a fully autonomous car  with no steering wheel and no pedals  by 2021. Mobileye envisions assembling its data into a giant map called Road Book, and plans to share it with Here. The idea is that Here at some point will license the mapping information for use by self-driving cars and Mobileye will get a share of that, Mr. Shashua said. Some of the money will go back to automakers like VW and BMW that add the mapping capability to their cars. There is a revenue-sharing model between us and the carmakers, he said, noting that map services are a future business. Consumers would be paying for map services for their autonomous cars.  Photo        In an image from the Ford digital map of Mcity, colors denote objects like road signs and a fence that were detected by a laser-based sensing system.   Credit Ford    The reason digital maps are so important is that even the most advanced sensors, like radar and cameras, are not enough to enable a car to navigate a chaotic and changing world safely enough to allow occupants to lean back and take a snooze. Digital maps ease the burden by helping give foresight to a cars computers, and adding redundancy to the cars understanding of the situation it faces, said Civil Maps chief executive, Sravan Puttagunta. Radar and cameras cannot always recognize a stop sign if pedestrians are standing in the way or the sign has been knocked down, he explained. But if the map knows there is a stop sign ahead, then the sensors just need to confirm it, Mr. Puttagunta said. Then the load on the sensors and processor is much lower. The need for data that can complement radar and camera readings was made clear last year when an Ohio man, Joshua Brown, died in a crash in Florida when his 2015 Tesla Model S was operating under control of the electric car s Autopilot system. As the car was traveling on a state highway at 74 miles per hour, a white tractor-trailer was crossing the road, but Autopilots sensors had trouble recognizing it against a bright sky. Tesla has said Autopilot may have thought the truck was an overpass.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   A digital map could have shown that there was no overpass in that location and that an obstacle was blocking the road. As it was, neither the car nor Mr. Brown hit the brakes. An investigation of the crash by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration found no safety defect in Teslas Autopilot technology. It added, however, that Tesla needed to be cautious in its marketing and advertising not to overstate the capabilities of Autopilot, a semiautonomous system that requires drivers to keep their eyes on the road and hands on the steering wheel. Last fall, Tesla updated Autopilot, and one upgrade is a basic use of digital mapping. Cars that have the new software, known as Version 8, note the positions of road signs, bridges and other objects, and send the data to a Tesla database that other Tesla vehicles can draw on to make safe driving decisions. Tesla calls this fleet learning.   A version of this article appears in print on March 3, 2017, on Page B1 of the New York edition with the headline: Creating a Road Map for the Self-Driving Car.

An expected White House announcement would clear the way for an overhaul of mileage and emissions targets.   Credit Daniel Roland/Associated Press     DETROIT  Automakers appear to be on the verge of a rare victory in their long-term effort to reduce government regulations on new cars and trucks. As soon as Tuesday, the Trump administration is expected to announce its agreement with the major auto companies that future mileage and emissions standards should be overhauled to reflect the growing consumer demand for larger, less fuel-efficient vehicles such as pickup trucks. Any decision by the Environmental Protection Agency and Transportation Department to reopen a review of the regulations could ease the pressure on the industry to meet the current target of 54 miles per gallon for vehicle fleets by 2025. Individual carmakers may react differently to a rollback of the federal standards. Some companies, for example, will continue to pursue electric car programs, while others may scale back their plans. And over all, the industry is likely to continue to make incremental fuel-economy improvements as new models are introduced, primarily as a selling point to consumers.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   But the aggressive targets of the Obama administration, which signed off on the current rules in January, would no longer loom as an escalating cost for automakers, which estimate that fewer than 4 percent of todays vehicles would meet the 2025 standards.  Continue reading the main story         Advertisement   Continue reading the main story       Even under E.P.A.s optimistic estimates, the automotive industry will have to spend a staggering $200 billion between 2012 and 2025 to comply, Mitch Bainwol, the president of the Auto Alliance trade group, wrote in a letter to regulators last month. Instead, auto companies will be given an opportunity to argue for less stringent standards during a government review period that could stretch into 2018. Environmental groups are already crying foul that car companies are now opposing the standards many of them agreed to during negotiations with the Obama administration in 2012  when gasoline prices were much higher, increasing demand for smaller cars, and after the administration had rescued General Motors and Chrysler in carefully choreographed bankruptcies. Auto manufacturers are attempting to backpedal on vital climate and consumer protections, said Michael Brune, the executive director of the Sierra Club. A new administration is no reason to go in reverse. Automakers are also hopeful that the new E.P.A. administrator, Scott Pruitt, will begin legal action to revoke Californias ability to enforce its tailpipe standards. At least some of the administrations moves to roll back regulations could face court challenges on environmental grounds. While executives are reluctant to publicly discuss efforts to pare environmental regulations, the topic was reportedly addressed during President Trumps initial meeting in January with the chief executives of the three Detroit automakers: General Motors, Ford Motor and Fiat Chrysler.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   An executive of one of the Detroit companies, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the meeting was confidential, said they had pressed Mr. Trump to abolish dueling standards for state and federal governments and to better align rules covering fuel economy and carbon emissions. It is unclear how far the new leadership at E.P.A. will go toward dismantling the rules that were so integral to former President Barack Obamas program to cut pollution that contributes to global warming .

No agency ever had set standards so far into the future, Mr. Bainwol said. No one could accurately project the circumstances affecting the technological and economic feasibility of these standards. With prices below $3 a gallon, the companies are eager to capitalize on the demand for larger vehicles. About three in five new vehicles sold in the United States are pickups and sport utilities, and analysts expect the trend to continue and expand into global markets as well. The outlook for electrified vehicles, however, would be affected by weaker long-term standards. Some automakers, such as Fiat Chrysler, have devoted few resources to electrified vehicles. Others are placing strategic bets on projects that tailor autonomous-driving technology to a new breed of electric cars. G.M.s new electric Chevrolet Bolt, for example, will be the preferred platform for the companys self-driving systems. And industry analysts doubt that any change in fuel-efficiency rules would reduce the momentum at G.M. and rivals such as Tesla for self-driving, electric models. But companies will be under less pressure to take dramatic steps to improve fuel economy on mass-market vehicles, such as shifting to lighter, more expensive materials or adding technology that improves performance without requiring more gasoline. Environmental activists fear that any pause in the efforts to improve fuel economy would stall the momentum toward cleaner cars.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   These vehicle efficiency and emissions rules have helped us cut oil use, reduce pollution, save money at the pump and reduce the risk of climate change, said Ken Kimmell, the president of the Union of Concerned Scientists. Industry analysts have suggested that relaxing fuel-efficiency targets is only the first in a series of policy changes by Mr. Trump directed at the auto industry. His vow to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement has drawn concern from automakers that rely on factories in Mexico to help supply the United States market. Reducing fuel-efficiency targets would save money for the car companies and usher in an unusual era of cooperation between the industry and Washington. By giving the automakers the relief they are clamoring for on fuel regulations, Mr. Trump could then prod them to expand investments and add jobs in their American operations.

A report by IOActive cited security flaws in some of these kind of robots.   Credit Franck Robichon/European Pressphoto Agency     SAN FRANCISCO  In the coming age of robotics, many of those autonomous machines will be internet-connected and mobile. What could possibly go wrong? Significant security flaws were found in an examination of six home and industrial robots, according to a report to be released Wednesday by IOActive, a computer security consulting firm with headquarters in Seattle. The report notes that only four of the six companies responded to the firms alert, and only two said they planned to make patches after being informed of the problems. The researchers, who described the categories of vulnerabilities they had discovered in the report but not the specific flaws, said their research was simply an early reconnaissance of the field. Its important to note that our testing was not even a deep, extensive security audit, as that would have taken a much larger investment of time and resources, the authors wrote. The goal for this work was to gain a high-level sense of how insecure todays robots are, which we accomplished.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   Despite the general nature of the report, industry specialists warn that if robot makers fail to take a security-first approach, it may haunt them.  Continue reading the main story         Advertisement   Continue reading the main story       The desire for online commerce brought strong cryptographic algorithms into our daily lives, said Joe Britt, the chief executive of Afero, a Los Altos, Calif.-based maker of secure communications systems for the world of so-called embedded computing. As embedded systems for sensors and robotics flourish in the next wave of computing, failure to apply these proven safeguards is like leaving the locks off of our doors. The research underscores the potential security challenges that await the world of mobile robots. Given the popularity of stationary home robotic systems like Amazons Echo and Googles Home personal assistants as well as dozens of other internet-connected devices like doorbells, video cameras and even light bulbs, it appears that consumers are willing to trust that manufacturers are building adequate security into the products. It is common for manufacturers that do not have good security practices to not know how to deal with vulnerability reports. Most of them probably do not have a procedure in place to handle reports and neither to provide security fixes to customers. Robots are widely used in manufacturing. But they are largely systems like robot arms that do not have autonomous functions and cannot move around in the environment.  Photo        Rethink Robotics says that vulnerabilities have been phased out of models like the Baxter, above.   Credit Sally Ryan for The New York Times    There is a growing consensus that during the next decade, advances in artificial intelligence will make it possible for robots to move freely in unstructured environments. This will bring self-driving cars closer to reality and will also lead to a generation of machines that will operate autonomously in homes, offices and factories. The authors of the new report challenged the robotics industry, saying that not enough attention was being given to well-known security issues that have proved devastating for existing commercial computer networks. We call it an internet-of-things with arms and legs and wheels, said Cesar Cerrudo, chief technology officer of IOActive. The surface of attack is huge. Each robot has multiple ways it can be compromised.  Newsletter Sign Up  Continue reading the main story        Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.  Invalid email address.

They forget about important issues. Robots can have microphones and cameras; they can walk and they can grab objects. People dont realize the consequences of something that can grab an object or can hear or see you. The report identifies security flaws in a number of robots, including NAO and Pepper home robots made by SoftBank Robotics; and manufacturing robots from Universal Robots and Rethink Robotics, two makers of robot arms that are intended to collaborate with human workers in assembly line applications. It also identifies flaws in small humanoid robots made by UBTECH Robotics and Robotis, and in robotics software developed by Asratec Corp. The report identifies seven different kinds of security issues, ranging from weak cryptographic systems and vulnerable default configurations to what security experts call authentication issues. In some cases, they noted that it was possible to control some robot functions without authentication. We found key robot services that didnt require a username and password, allowing anyone to remotely access those services, the report said. One of the robot manufacturers identified by the report disputed the findings. Two of the criticisms leveled by the researchers actually involved features added for research and education markets, according to Gil Haylon, a Rethink Robotics spokesman. He added that other vulnerabilities had been phased out in the latest software release for the companys Baxter and Sawyer robots, which are intended for light assembly operations. Universal Robots said it was looking into the issue raised by the researchers. The other companies did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

Scientists estimate that because Volkswagen sold 11 million diesel cars worldwide rigged with software that cheated emissions tests, 1,200 people in Europe will die prematurely.   Credit Sipa, via Associated Press     From 2008 to 2015, Volkswagen sold 11 million diesel cars worldwide rigged with software that cheated emissions tests by running the full emissions-control system only if the car sensed a test was underway. Otherwise, the cars operated without emissions control, releasing more than four times the levels of nitrogen oxides, a class of harmful air pollutants, permitted by European regulation. Now, scientists at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology estimate that 1,200 people in Europe will die prematurely, each losing as much as a decade of life, because of excess emissions from 2.6 million affected cars sold just in Germany. All diesel cars produce high levels of nitrogen oxides, or NOx, because they burn fuel at a higher temperature than cars that run on gasoline, said Guillaume Chossiere , a research assistant at M.I.T. and lead author of the study.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   The point is what you do with these NOx emissions, Mr. Chossiere said. Manufacturers can, and should, make them as low as possible by allowing emissions-control devices to work properly.     Graphic  How Volkswagens Defeat Devices Worked  Volkswagen admitted that 11 million of its vehicles were equipped with software that was used to cheat on emissions tests. This is how the technology works and what it now means for vehicle owners.         OPEN Graphic      To arrive at their estimates, Mr. Chossiere and his colleagues calculated excess levels of NOx within Germany by combining data on Volkswagens sales, driving behavior and on-road measurements of Volkswagen cars emissions.  Continue reading the main story         Advertisement   Continue reading the main story       Then the researchers simulated how NOx emissions might travel over long distances. Based on how much extra NOx people were breathing in across Europe, the researchers estimated increased mortality because of cardiopulmonary and respiratory diseases.

Andreas Meurer, a spokesman for Volkswagen, said that investigations by the German, French and British governments had found that emissions from the companys vehicles are comparable with, and in many cases even better, than those of our competitors. While that may be true of Volkswagens most recent generation of cars, the company can still significantly cut emissions by removing test recognition software from older models, Mr. Chossiere said. Such software has been outlawed in the United States, but still occupies a legal gray area in Europe. A natural next step for us is to focus on excess emissions by all manufacturers, Mr. Chossiere added. Europe has very severe air quality issues, and enforcing standards in diesel cars should be considered as a first step toward cleaner air.

The male faces the female and slowly, slowly lifts up one foot, sets it down and lifts the other. Check out my feet! Theyre blue. R eally, really blue. The female mirrors his ponderous moves. M ine are blue, too. Is this ground sticky, or what? He leans over, spreads his wings wide, points his bill at the sky and whistles breathily, as if blowing on a toy flute. She grunts and totters up to him, and they clack bills. He grabs a pebble, and they clack bills again; he drops the pebble and spears a twig. Clack, whistle, grunt, whistle. And suddenly, she backs away. Desperate, the male solemnly starts high-stepping again, displaying his beautiful teal-blue feet. But the courtship has fizzled, and when the female again lifts up a foot in response, it looks as if shes waving goodbye. Its dating time here for the blue-footed booby. Everywhere, dozens of times a day, the large, handsome seabirds are making their highly ritualized courtship display  one reason the boobies are among the most celebrated and beloved residents of this archipelago.   From "Love in The Animal Kingdom"  Video by Nature on PBS   They are also feeding voraciously and spectacularly, circling high over the water, alert for the slightest flicker of fish, and then freezing in midair for a fraction of a second before dropping headfirst onto their targets, like missiles falling from a plane.

On the Galapagos and on Isla Isabel, a Mexican national park south of the coast of Baja, blue-footed boobies have no real predators to fear or human hunters to shun, and as a result they live proud, public lives.

Credit The Asahi Shimbun Premium, via Getty Images        Research teams from Mexico and the United States have followed populations of the long-lived birds for years, even decades, and they have gathered a wealth of insights into the deep nature of being Sula nebouxii: how boobies choose and lose mates, the shifting allure of fidelity versus adultery, the measured brutality of older siblings, the contingency of parental love and the reason behind the boobies fetish for feet. Theyre superfascinating animals and such a good research model, said David J. Anderson of Wake Forest University in Winston-Salem, N.C., who studies both the blue-footed booby and the related Nazca booby. They let you move among them without minding too much. You try to do that with a continental bird or mammal  forget about it. But with these guys you see it all.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   In one discovery that subverted expectations, Oscar Sanchez Macouzet and Hugh Drummond of the National Autonomous University of Mexico and their colleagues determined that boobies subjected to severe bullying and abuse as nestlings suffered few consequences as adults. No matter how relentlessly the birds had been pecked at and bitten by older siblings, no matter how often food had been snatched from their beaks or how slowly they had grown, on reaching maturity the once-persecuted birds proved surprisingly confident, capable  unflappable. They were able to attract partners, repel rivals and raise families as successfully as their domineering peers.

While many boobies change partners from season to season, there are great benefits of long-term fidelity, researchers have found. Comparing the breeding success of pairs that had been together for years with that of similarly mature boobies that had recently repartnered, scientists determined that the established pairs reared 35 percent more offspring to fledglinghood compared with the new mates. And in new findings that will be published soon  and are enough to turn this working mothers feet cerulean  scientists have discovered that the key to a successful long-term booby partnership is the equitable sharing of nest duties year after year. Biparental care is the rule among boobies, but longtime mates have perfected the art of symmetry and turn-taking. They spend the same time brooding and feeding the young, and expend the same physical effort as seen in measures of blood cells and body mass. Such egalitarian couples, said Dr. Sanchez Macouzet, have reached the sweet spot of cooperation, compatibility and a willingness to avoid the exploitation of your partner.  Photo      Blue-footed boobies during a courtship dance.   Credit Tui De Roy/Minden Pictures    Dr. Drummond and his colleagues have also identified another booby mating pattern that seems to work nearly as well as a stable long-term partnership and in some ways contradicts it: the May-December effect. For reasons that remain mysterious, Dr. Drummond said, booby couples in which one bird is young and the other old often have greater breeding success compared with pairs of the same age.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   Analyzing the outcomes of 3,361 booby offspring, the researchers found that the chicks of age-mismatched parents were significantly more likely to later become parents themselves compared with the progeny of similarly aged pairs. It didnt matter whether the mother was younger than the father or vice versa. The advantage to the chicks was the same either way, Dr. Drummond said. Life is complicated, he added, and every year boobies are conjuring with several different variables when making their choice among partners.  Continue reading the main story        Photo        Blue-footed boobies, which hit the water at 60 miles per hour, hunting in Elizabeth Bay, at the western side of the Galapagos archipelago.   Credit Tui De Roy/Minden Pictures        Someone familiar? Someone new? Nonnegotiable: The feet must be blue. Blue-footed boobies are members of the family Sulidae, a group that includes about 10 species of gannets and boobies and is, by some analyses, part of the larger pelican order. The name booby is thought to come from bobo, the Spanish word for stupid or clown, a reference to the birds awkward waddle. Blue-footed boobies can be found throughout the tropics and subtropics of the eastern Pacific. Though their overall population is not considered endangered, their numbers on the Galapagos have fallen since the 1990s, the result, scientists believe, of a local decline in the sardine stocks that the boobies need to breed. The birds are about the size of large sea gulls, with wingspans up to five feet. Adult females are about 20 percent to 30 percent heavier and stronger than males. Boobies stay close to home, and if given the chance, most will live and breed within a few dozen feet of where they were born. They often hunt small, schooling fish in flocks, each hitting the water at 60 miles per hour, its brain protected by specialized air sacs in the skull.  Photo        A blue-footed booby with a begging chick.The key to a successful long-term booby partnership is the equitable sharing of nest duties year after year.   Credit Tui De Roy/Minden Pictures    In many birds, males are the fancy ones, their exaggerated, colorful features the result of generations of females expressing their whimsical tastes in mates. Among blue-footed boobies, by contrast, males and females are both choosy about their partners, and one of the traits they fixate on is the relative blue-ness of a partners feet. The optimal color, it turns out, is more of a turquoise. Analyzing the boobys blue feet, researchers have determined that the color is a result of both structural and pigmental components. The basic tone, a flat, purplish-blue, is set by an alignment of proteins stacked in the skin like spaghetti in a box that preferentially encage and emphasize blue light.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   But the birds bodies modify that basic blue through diet, extracting bright yellow pigment from carotenoids in the fish they consume and concentrating it in their feet to create a dazzling aquamarine. Researchers have found that booby eyes are keenly sensitive to blue-green light, and for good reason: Foot tone turns out to be a revealing sign of health and hardiness. In a series of experiments , Roxana Torres of National Autonomous University and Alberto Velando of the University of Vigo in Spain and their colleagues showed that male boobies feet turned drab after just 48 hours of food deprivation and brightened again when feeding resumed. The injection of diphtheria and other vaccines would also affect a boobys blue coloration, by setting up a competition between the skin of the feet and the newly taxed immune system for precious dietary carotenoids.  Photo        A Blue-footed booby and its two chicks.   Credit Tui De Roy/Minden Pictures    Males avoid mating with females whose feet has been dulled with paint, the researchers also discovered . And when a males feet are artificially dulled after his mate has laid one egg, the female responds to the apparent decline in his condition through a downsizing of her own, making her second egg smaller than the first . The calculus of daily life never stops. Boobies generally lay two eggs several days apart, and the older chick ends up with an enormous advantage over the second-born. In some booby species, like the Nazca, the difference is fatal. The big one up and kills the little one, pushing it right out of the nest, Dr. Anderson said. The only hope for the second-born is if its sibling dies. Among blue-footed boobies, though, sibling violence is provisional. As long as the parents can regurgitate enough food for both, the older, bigger sibling tolerates the second hatchling. It will peck at the younger bird and demand chronic displays of submissive behavior, like facing away with its bill tucked down, but in good times it will let its sibling live. Should the body mass of the elder nestling decline to 80 percent of normal, however, it will increase the daily pecking of its sibling by 500 percent, Dr. Drummond said. The heightened abuse can be fatal. Just make it through your miserable childhood, beta booby, and youll soon be high-stepping in style.

Credit Justin Sullivan/Getty Images     WASHINGTON  The Trump administration is expected to begin rolling back stringent federal regulations on vehicle pollution that contributes to global warming , according to people familiar with the matter, essentially marking a U-turn to efforts to force the American auto industry to produce more electric cars . The announcement  which is expected as soon as Tuesday and will be made jointly by the Environmental Protection Agency administrator, Scott Pruitt, and the transportation secretary, Elaine L. Chao  will immediately start to undo one of former President Barack Obamas most significant environmental legacies. During the same week, and possibly on the same day, Mr. Trump is expected to direct Mr. Pruitt to begin the more lengthy and legally complex process of dismantling the Clean Power Plan, Mr. Obamas rules to cut planet-warming pollution from coal-fired power plants. The regulatory rollback on vehicle pollution will relax restrictions on tailpipe emissions of carbon dioxide and will not require action by Congress. It will also have a major effect on the United States auto industry.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   Under the Obama administrations vehicle fuel economy standards, American automakers were locked into nearly a decade of trying to design and build ever more sophisticated fuel-efficient vehicles, including electric and hybrid models. The nations largest auto companies told Mr. Trump last month that they found those technical requirements too burdensome.

E.P.A. officials did not respond to emails requesting comment on the move. On Feb. 21, a coalition of the 17 largest companies that sell cars in the United States sent two letters to Mr. Pruitt, asking him to revisit the tailpipe rules. They said it may be the single most important decision the E.P.A. has made in recent history. They complained about the steep technical challenge posed by the stringent standard, noting that only about 3.5 percent of new vehicles are able to reach it. That even excludes some hybrid cars, plug-in electric cars and fuel cell vehicles, the automakers wrote. Even today, no conventional vehicle today meets that target.

Former Obama administration officials and environmentalists denounced Mr. Trumps expected announcement. The rest of the world is moving forward with electric cars. If the Trump administration goes backward, the U.S. wont be able to compete globally, said Margo T. Oge, a former senior E.P.A. official and the author of Driving the Future: Combating Climate Change With Cleaner, Smarter Cars. This means theyll just keep polluting, said S. William Becker, the executive director of the National Association of Clean Air Agencies. He also predicted that if this administration goes after the California waiver, there will be an all-out brawl between Trump and California and the other states that will defend its program.

They would have forced automakers to build passenger cars that achieve an average of 54.5 miles per gallon by 2025, compared with about 36 miles per gallon today. Eventually achieving those targets would have drastically reduced the nations vehicle tailpipe pollution, which accounts for about a third of the United States total greenhouse gas emissions. Those regulations are locked into place for vehicle model years through 2021, and just before Mr. Trump took office, the E.P.A. put forth a final rule intended to cement them for vehicles built from 2022 through 2025. However, the E.P.A. did not jointly release its plan to do so with the Transportation Department, leaving a legal loophole for the Trump administration to take advantage of. The E.P.A.s Clean Power Plan regulations, which would cut climate-warming pollution from power plants, will probably be much harder for Mr. Pruitt to undo. He will have to legally withdraw the existing rule and propose a new rule to replace it, a process that could take up to two years and is expected to be fraught with legal challenges and delays along the way. The effort to undo the tailpipe standards will be much more legally simple. After withdrawing the Obama administrations requirement for model years 2022 through 2025, the Trump administration will have a year to put forth an alternative set of efficiency standards, people familiar with the matter said.
