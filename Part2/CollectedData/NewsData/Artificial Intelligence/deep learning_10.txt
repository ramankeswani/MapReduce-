From left, makeup looks from Erin Fetherston, Adam Selman and Jason Wus fall 2017 collections.   Credit Imaxtree.com        The powdered, matte face has long been out of favor. But its replacement, the look of the moment, is a moving target. It wasnt long ago that contouring was a YouTube obsession, followed soon after by strobing and assorted batty offshoots. Whatever the technique, though, the focus was always on using light (or its absence) to enhance ones features. During the fall 2017 fashion shows that just ended, some makeup artists did just that in the prettiest way possible, using a combination of blush and highlighter. The collections were autumnal, but the models were aglow with springlike dewy skin. By adding both highlight and blush, it gives a liveliness to the skin, which is very beautiful all year round, said Kelli Bartlett, the vice president for makeup and new services at the beauty-services booking app Glamsquad . She created an understated glow at the Erin Fetherston show at New York Fashion Week . That freshness is the looks key. And getting it is easy. Swap out powdered versions of blush and highlighter for cream and liquid formulas.     How to Get Dewy Spring Skin  The best blushes, highlighters and extras that deliver just the right radiance.             There are two types of glow that can be achieved on the skin, said Troy Surratt, the makeup artist and founder of Surratt Beauty . Light-reflective uses shimmer, and humectant adds glow with dewy moisture. And sometimes a product is a combination of both.

The look is also noticeably without contour.  Continue reading the main story         Advertisement   Continue reading the main story       Contour intimidates some women, Ms. Bartlett said. They can end up with stripes on the face. You have to be an expert blender. So this idea that you can non-tour is great. You can change the face structure with just highlighter and blush. People tend to think of highlighters as universal shades. Not so, according to Sir John, the makeup artist and LOreal Paris brand ambassador. He suggests cool-toned colors like silver or frosty pinks for fair skin. Olive and medium skin tones are best lit with gold. And for dark skin, try rose gold or copper.

For deep skin tones, Ms. Bartlett advised opting for vibrant colors. Otherwise you risk them not showing up or looking muddy, she said. Bright oranges and reds add warmth to the skin. Deep plums and raisin tones add depth. Before applying blush or highlighter, make sure skin is moisturized or primed. Cream products can drag on the skin and deposit supersaturated color thats more difficult to blend out, Mr. Surratt said. Apply blush first, starting on the apples of the cheeks, then sweeping up toward the temple. This will frame the face and create structure without contouring. With the index finger, tap cream or liquid highlighter along the bridge of the nose, on top of cheekbones, in the middle of the eyelid, at the inner corners of the eye and the cupids bow. Buff the highlighter with a small fluffy brush. The results will be beautiful  but dont overdo it. Highlighter isnt meant for the center of the face toward the nose. Youll end up looking greasy, Sir John said.   Continue following our fashion and lifestyle coverage on Facebook ( Styles and Modern Love ), Twitter ( Styles , Fashion and Weddings ) and Instagram .

Freud, as we know, was exceptionally sensitive to the thought of growing old, and he delighted in this new coadjutor who had youth and to spare, being not only young in fact but young by his very name, and young (it seems clear) by virtue of his being Germanic and not Jewish. Jung, for his part, received from Freud the heady sense of having been chosen for a high destiny. A family legend had it that his grandfather, of the same name as himself, was an illegitimate son of Goethe, and it might be said that Freud licensed Jungs ambition to rival in fame this supposititious ancestor. _________   Think you know supposititious?

Those who werent gonged were rated by the judges on a 1-to-10 scale. In keeping with the ridiculousness of the proceedings, the prize amount they vied for was ridiculous: $516.32 on the daytime version of the show, $712.05 on the prime-time edition.  The show, which ran on NBC until 1978 and then in syndication (with revivals in later years), became a cultural sensation. Critics complained about its crassness and cruelty, but Mr. Barris, like purveyors of burlesque and circus sideshows in earlier generations, knew there was a large audience for lowbrow. At one point the daytime version was attracting 78 percent of viewers 18 to 49. _________   Think you know burlesque?

He found out where a race was being held and invited me along, on a gray and bleak evening in the Yorkshire Dales.  ... Despite the slate-gray skies and constant dampness (we were near enough to Bronte country) there were laughter and smiles aplenty as on a shout, the runners set off up what I thought of then as an impossibly steep hill. They disappeared through a forest on their way to a distant, clouded summit. The rain pelted down, and then, with a slap-slap-slap of wet running shoes, the runners emerged again, with heaving breath, going at full tilt down the hillside, arms flailing to keep balance on the sodden ground. _________   Think you know sodden?

Credit Hiroko Masuike/The New York Times     In your ideal world, what type of college or university would you attend? Provide details on what it would it be like. What requirements  if any  would be placed on students, both for admission and for graduation? Does this college already exist? In  The Young Mariners of Throgs Neck , Gary M. Stern writes: New York City is a college town. With no fewer than 137 institutions of higher learning, from community colleges to world-class private universities to specialized colleges like the John Jay College of Criminal Justice and the Juilliard School for music, there is a school for virtually every academic pursuit.  Even, it may come as a surprise, for future merchant mariners. Tucked away under the Throgs Neck Bridge in the Bronx is the often overlooked State University of New York Maritime College, which has become known for its strong engineering and marine transportation programs.  According to a new study, recent graduates of SUNY Maritime earn more than graduates of any other university in the United States. When Payscale.com surveyed the annual incomes of 1.4 million midcareer graduates with bachelors degrees, Maritime College ranked first, with an average income of $144,000, surpassing M.I.T., Harvey Mudd College and Princeton University.  The college is an unusual blend of engineering school and military academy; a majority of the students train to be merchant mariners, wearing uniforms and following a strict regimen that prohibits freshmen, for one thing, from leaving campus during the school week.  A typical cadet is Cullen Palicka, a 20-year-old junior who was raised in Manhattan and attended the Harbor School, a maritime-themed high school on Governors Island, which provided his first taste of life at sea. For Mr. Palicka, sailing on the Training Ship Empire State VI is what sets Maritime College apart from the typical college.  The navy blue ship  565 feet long with a 32-foot draft, and weighing more than 17,000 tons  is crucial to Maritime Colleges mission. Every cadet spends 45 days on it in the summers after freshman and sophomore years, then does a 90-day tour after junior year. They are responsible for the ships navigation, plotting the course and powering the ship, said Lori Shull, the director of communication at the college.  It serves as a traveling lab, replete with pumps and motors. Youre no longer in a classroom, with a desk, chair and whiteboard, Mr. Palicka said. Thats our classroom. Students: Read the entire article, then tell us:  Were you surprised to hear there is a special college for merchant mariners in New York City? Why or why not?  Would you be more excited about college if you could attend one that highly specializes in what you want to learn? Why or why not?  What specialty college would you create, what would you name it, what would the student body and faculty be like, and where would it be located?  Photo        Note: The New York Maritime College in the Bronx is sometimes confused with the United States Merchant Marine Academy at Kings Point. See websites for details.

Do you fall asleep easily and stay asleep until the morning? Do you wake up naturally, without an alarm? Describe your own sleep patterns, needs and any challenges you have to getting a good nights sleep. In  Yes, Your Sleep Schedule Is Making You Sick , Richard A. Friedman, a professor of clinical psychiatry and the director of the psychopharmacology clinic at the Weill Cornell Medical College, writes: Jet lag makes everyone miserable. But it makes some people mentally ill.  Theres a psychiatric hospital not far from Heathrow Airport that is known for treating bipolar and schizophrenic travelers, some of whom are occasionally found wandering aimlessly through the terminals. A study from the 1980s of 186 of those patients found that those whod traveled from the west had a higher incidence of mania, while those whod traveled from the east had a higher incidence of depression.  I saw the same thing in one of my patients who suffered from manic depression. When he got depressed after a vacation to Europe, we assumed he was just disappointed about returning to work. But then he had a fun trip out West and returned home in whats called a hypomanic state: He was expansive, a fount of creative ideas.  It was clear that his changes in mood werent caused by the vacation blues, but by something else. The problem turned out to be a disruption in his circadian rhythm. He didnt need drugs; he needed the right doses of sleep and sunlight at the right time.  It turns out that that prescription could treat much of what ails us.  Clinicians have long known that there is a strong link between sleep, sunlight and mood. Problems sleeping are often a warning sign or a cause of impending depression, and can make people with bipolar disorder manic. Some 15 years ago, Dr. Francesco Benedetti, a psychiatrist in Milan, and colleagues noticed that hospitalized bipolar patients who were assigned to rooms with views of the east were discharged earlier than those with rooms facing the west  presumably because the early morning light had an antidepressant effect.  Students: Read the entire article, then tell us:  What did you learn about the relationship between sleep, sunlight and mood? Were you aware that there is a natural method to fix sleep-related mood issues like depression?  Dr. Friedman supposes that the reasons more depressed patients dont receive chronotherapy are that it isnt taught in medical school, and that sleep deprivation or light cant be patented so there is little financial incentive to invest in this treatment or research. Do you agree? Why or why not?  Should more medical schools teach chronobiology? Should more medical practitioners use natural methods to adjust sleep and mood disturbances? Why or why not?    How well do you sleep? Take this quiz to see how well your inner clock matches the clock on the wall. If you developed a sleep problem, would you want to try light therapy? Why or why not?
