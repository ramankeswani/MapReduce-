BOUDETTE   MARCH 30, 2017      Continue reading the main story  Share This Page   Continue reading the main story            Photo        Emily Hurwitz, 28, an advertising executive who lives in San Francisco, with her 2012 Volkswagen Tiguan, which was recently purchased through Shift, a used-car online retailer.   Credit Peter DaSilva for The New York Times     Dennis McNabb had just started thinking about buying a roomier car last year when he suddenly had no choice. A heavy storm rolled across Texas and dropped golf-ball-size hail that pummeled his 2013 Hyundai Genesis and punched holes in the sedans windows. Another shock came when Mr. McNabb, a firefighter from San Antonio, saw the sticker prices of new cars. The Toyota 4Runner sport utility vehicle had caught his eye, but 2016 models were more than $40,000 when loaded up with the heated seats, touch screen and other options that he wanted. Mr. McNabb quickly found a solution: a used 2014 4Runner with 38,000 miles that cost him just $29,750 and came with a one-year warranty. The new ones are fairly expensive, and you lose about a third of the value as soon as you drive it off the lot, he said. The 2014 is pretty much fully loaded, and its practically the same car as the 2016, but way less. Kind of a no-brainer.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   Over the last several years, as the American economy has gained steam and consumers have rushed out to buy new cars, the average price of a new automobile has edged higher and higher. Last year, new vehicles on average sold for a record $34,077 , according to Edmunds.com, an auto-information website. Thats a 2.7 percent increase from 2015 and a 13 percent jump since 2011.  Continue reading the main story         Advertisement   Continue reading the main story       Thats also more than many consumers can or want to pay. The result is that used cars, especially the nearly new models that were leased or turned in by their original buyers, represent increasingly enticing deals. Its very hard to beat the value of a late-model used car, said Jessica Caldwell, a senior analyst at Edmunds.com . Depreciation is one of the biggest costs of owning a car, she noted. If you buy a used car with low mileage, someone else has already taken the depreciation hit, so its a very smart way to get a car. New-car prices are rising as automakers add more technology. Features like rear cameras, radar sensors, collision-preventing automatic braking systems and Bluetooth are now standard in most new cars and trucks. Americans preference for S.U.V.s and other larger vehicles is also pushing prices higher compared with the days when less expensive small cars were more in vogue. Consumers arent the only ones seeing opportunities in used vehicles. In Jackson, Mich., 80 miles west of Detroit, Wes Lutz has just built a 5,000-square-foot addition to his Chrysler Dodge Jeep franchise to accommodate his expanding used-car sales. Weve hired salespeople and managers because theres a lot of demand for used cars, Mr. Lutz said. If youre looking at a $33,000 price for new, you can get a similar car for half the price. Thats a great deal, especially for people who dont drive that much, or first-time car buyers. Mr. Lutz estimates that hell soon be selling 200 or more used cars a month, up from the 130 he typically sold per month last year. Other, bigger car dealers are making similar bets. AutoNation , a chain of 371 new-car franchises, is spending up to $500 million to set up a chain of used-only outlets. The first opens in Corpus Christi, Tex., in May. The company is also trying to take some of the anxiety out of buying used cars. Its new-car franchises now offer pre-owned models with uniform, no-haggle pricing, and promise to fix or disclose any recall issues a used car has.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   More people will look at used if theyve got peace of mind that youre getting a fair price, said Marc Cannon, AutoNation s vice president of marketing. Theres a lot of potential in the used business, and we think this is what consumers want.  Photo        A used-car lot in Reading, Pa. Americans bought 38.5 million used cars in 2016.   Credit Mark Makela for The New York Times    Americans purchased 38.5 million used cars in 2016, about the same as in 2015. That includes all used cars, from 20-year-old rust buckets to former demonstration models that dealers sell as used even though they may have fewer than 100 miles on the odometer. Sales of certified pre-owned cars rose 4 percent from 2015, to a record 2.6 million vehicles in 2016, according to Edmunds.com. Those are cars that are less than three years old, generally have under 50,000 miles, and have been inspected and serviced by a franchise dealer. They usually come with an extension to the original warranty. Thats the type of deal Mr. McNabb got on his 4Runner. Like new-car prices, used prices have also been rising, to an average of $19,189 in 2016, according to Edmunds.com. But analysts think used prices will ease because inventories are rising. This year, about 3.5 million cars that were leased for two or three years will be returned and sold as gently used cars, Ms. Caldwell, the Edmunds.com analyst, said. One caveat about buying pre-owned cars is that they are usually not subject to the rebates and discounts manufacturers typically offer on new cars. Also, even cars that are only a year or two old may not have the latest technology. So it pays to shop carefully. Joe Codiroli, a Defense Department consultant in Richmond, Va., discovered that last month when he looked for a bargain on a slightly used Subaru Forester . He wanted to get a model with EyeSight, Subarus safety electronics system, which includes advanced cruise control with automatic braking and blind-spot warning technology. The used Foresters he found didnt have those features. On top of that, he found that Subaru was offering zero-percent financing on the 2017 Forester. He picked out a reddish one  a color Subaru calls Venetian pearl. It came down to a few thousand dollars difference between new and used, Mr. Codiroli said. So the value for the extra features and the zero-percent swayed me to go with new. And hes glad he opted for the latest safety electronics. If a car cuts in front of me on the highway, it just slows down nice and easy, he said. Its phenomenal. Its easier to drive, and I feel a lot safer.

CHAPMAN   MARCH 23, 2017      Continue reading the main story  Share This Page   Continue reading the main story           Photo        Steven Gold outside his home in Oak Park, Mich. If I were still a good driver in a few years, Id consider a semiautonomous car, he said.   Credit Brittany Greeson for The New York Times        Single, childless and 68, Steven Gold has begun to think about future mobility and independence. Although in good health, he can foresee a time when he wont be a confident driver, if he can drive at all. While he hopes to continue to live in his suburban Detroit home, he wonders how he will be able to get to places like his doctors office and the supermarket if his driving becomes impaired. For Mr. Gold and other older adults, self-driving cars might be a solution. The number of United States residents age 70 and older is projected to increase to 53.7 million in 2030, from 30.9 million in 2014, according to the Institute for Highway Safety. Nearly 16 million people 65 and older live in communities where public transportation is poor or nonexistent. That number is expected to grow rapidly as baby boomers remain outside of cities. The aging of the population converging with autonomous vehicles might close the coming mobility gap for an aging society, said Joseph Coughlin, the director of the Massachusetts Institute for Technology AgeLab in Cambridge. He said that 70 percent of those over age 50 live in the suburbs, a figure he expects to remain steady despite a recent rise in moves to urban centers. Further, 92 percent of older people want to age in place, he said.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   Mr. Coughlin said on-demand services like Uber and Lyft were viable alternatives to autonomous cars, but are not available in many areas where older adults live. Although these companies now offer limited app-free services, some older people are wary of riding with strangers and being able to identify the right vehicle. For his part, Mr. Gold said such services were too expensive for regular use.  Continue reading the main story         Advertisement   Continue reading the main story       Doris Alexander, a retired registered nurse who lives in Chicago, recently tried Uber for the first time, enjoyed it, and cannot envision going driverless. I wouldnt know how to act, said Ms. Alexander, 77, who typically relies on public transportation. The concept that Im in a car, the car is driving, and I have no driver  its just something thats a little too strange for me. In many cases, as with Mr. Gold, there are no children around to provide transportation. A recent study led by Dr. Maria Torroella Carney of Northwell Health in Great Neck, N.Y., found that 22 percent of baby boomers are now or at risk of becoming so-called elder orphans, with limited access to transportation. If I were still a good driver in a few years, Id consider a semiautonomous car, said Mr. Gold, who lives in Oak Park, Mich., and drives a 2015 Honda Fit . And if I were in a situation where driving was too physically difficult, then Id consider a fully autonomous car. Along with other firms, automakers including Audi, General Motors, Ford Motor, Nissan, Honda, Mercedes-Benz, Volvo and BMW are all in the race to reduce or eliminate the amount of time a person in a vehicle is actually driving. There are several levels of autonomy, going in stages from driver assistance to full automation. For example, by 2020 Honda is aiming to bring to market a vehicle with a high level of automated capability in highway situations. By years end, Volvo plans to put highly automated XC90 vehicles in the hands of real-world drivers in Sweden as part of its Volvo Drive Me program. Within the next four years, BMW hopes to have cars on the street with midlevel automation. BMW and other companies are also working on driverless prototypes that have no steering wheel, brake or gas pedal. Still, a world in which fully automated cars are common remains many years away. Its all going to be a slow transition, said Nicole Carriere, director of public relations for Edmunds.com . There will be a fundamental shift, but it wont be overnight.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   The spectrum of vehicles eventually coming to market will allow older drivers to consider the types that suit them best. For example, some auto manufacturers are developing semiautonomous systems that give drivers seconds to prepare to re-engage to avoid collision, and will pull to the side of the road if re-engagement is not detected. Experts say such systems may not be optimal for those who take some medications or may have difficulty reorienting themselves. Keep in mind that driving abilities vary among older adults, said Dr. Nir Barzilai, director of the Institute for Aging Research at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine in the Bronx. Its not chronological age thats important, its biological, he said. There are 100-year-old drivers who are fine, and some 60-year-olds who shouldnt be on the road. James Kenyon is a Detroit franchise owner of Visiting Angels, an agency that provides nonmedical home care for seniors. From what he has observed, older seniors could have a difficult time adjusting to driverless technology. Its a whole mind-set change for the elderly to have something that they cant control, and even getting their children to buy into it, Mr. Kenyon said. Theoretically, it sounds great, but there are so many possible impediments that have to be worked out, like, if theres a problem, what do they do? One fear is ending up at the wrong destination, a worry that should not be paramount, said Oliver Rumpf-Steppat, head of BMWs United States product requirements engineering division. Although autonomous-car production is still in the test phase, he said vehicles would most likely rely on voice-recognition systems. You can say, Take me to the eye doctor or grocery store. It will come back and ask which one, he said. Most of the time, we get it right. Marcus Rothoff also hopes to assuage concerns. He is the project leader of the Volvo Drive Me program, which aims to include 100 Swedish drivers over several months. One goal, he said, is to see how older drivers handle the new technology. We need people who are a bit skeptical about autonomous driving  otherwise we will not learn how to build trust and understand their views and expectations, he said. One important group is senior drivers. Ultimately, the driver interface and interaction needs to be so intuitive that no training is needed. Mr. Coughlin said purveyors of autonomous technology would be smart to keep older drivers in mind. If seniors dont trust the technology and dont like giving up control, he said, it will slow down this business dramatically.

Credit Jose Jordan/Agence France-Presse  Getty Images     A beast. Real monsters. Formula One racecars are fast, but rarely have they been described so breathlessly. Regulations introduced this year have made the cars faster, with more downforce and grip, but harder to drive, creating a challenge for drivers and, in theory, more-exciting races. Fans will get their first look at the cars in a grand prix in Melbourne, Australia, on Sunday, but drivers were able to test the cars for eight days recently at the Circuit de Barcelona-Catalunya in Spain. And the drivers were grinning. Fernando Alonso, a two-time champion who now races with the McLaren-Honda team, said he would no longer be driving like a small child and that it had been fun to drive freely again. Lewis Hamilton of Mercedes, another champion, described his new car as a beast. Toto Wolff, the principal of the Mercedes team, called the cars real monsters and said Formula One has ticked the right box with the changes.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   Theyre the fastest cars on the planet, the fastest-ever Formula One cars, he said in an interview. They generate more downforce, they look spectacular. I feel what has been achieved is tremendous.  Continue reading the main story         Advertisement   Continue reading the main story       The new regulations were designed to place more emphasis on the driver, to provide him with a greater challenge and result in more overtaking, which has always been a thorny issue in Formula One. Mercedess dominance over the last three seasons has resulted in little excitement at the head of the field. In many grands prix, overtaking happened only behind the Mercedes drivers as others battled for the minor places. So the new regulations, in essence, are aimed at Mercedes, giving other teams a chance to win and creating more-thrilling battles that include strong teams like Ferrari and Red Bull. The big change is in the tires. They have increased in width, to provide more grip, with the front tires going to 12 inches from 10 inches, and the rear tires increasing to 16 inches from 13 inches. Similarly, the front wing is now wider, to increase downforce, with the span growing to 71 inches from 65 inches. The height of the rear wing has been lowered to 31 inches from 37 inches.   F1 (2017) Who Is Looking Strongest For Australia After Testing  Video by F1 Legends   The cars also look more aggressive, but with new shark-fin engine covers and appendages added to the front wing, some think they are uglier. There is no doubt the cars are faster. When the planned changes were announced in 2015, it was suggested that the cars would become five to six seconds per lap quicker, with much of that time made up in the corners.  Photo        Valtteri Bottas of Mercedes is pushed to the garage during winter testing in Spain.   Credit Albert Gea/Reuters    Indeed, the fastest lap during the Barcelona testing was six seconds faster than the pole position time for the 2015 Spanish Grand Prix at the same track.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   Even Christian Horner, the Red Bull team principal, agreed with Wolff about the benefits of the new cars, and it is rare for them to find such common ground. The cars look great, Horner said. They certainly look more like Formula One cars, and they are definitely giving the drivers more of a workout. For Horner, the one key ingredient still missing is the sound, a byproduct of the current turbo-hybrid power units, which dont produce the guttural sound the V8 engines did a few years ago. The sound issue is unlikely to be tackled until 2020, when new systems could be introduced. Where Wolff and Horner do differ, however, is on the subject of overtaking. Both agree that overtaking should never be easy, but Wolff said he fears that the redesign  which allows cars to brake later entering a corner  will further reduce overtaking. The cars still possess an overtaking aid, the drag reduction system, or D.R.S., where the angle of the rear-wing flap is altered to reduce drag and can be used by a driver to make a pass when he is within a second of the car in front, and at certain points on a circuit. Despite that, Wolff said, Im still a bit worried, and I havent changed my mind in the last two years, that in making the cars faster it will make overtaking difficult. During testing in Barcelona, Horner said his drivers Daniel Ricciardo and Max Verstappen were able to follow other cars reasonably closely, as was the case last year.

Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   Bob Fernley, the Force India deputy team principal, said he thinks the changes to the regulations will reduce overtaking. From a Force India perspective, we were never 100 percent comfortable with the concept we now have, he said in an interview. My concern at the time of discussing the 2017 regulations, and still is today, is that we are totally front-wing dependent, and clearly that will have an impact on overtaking, Fernley said. Another significant change for this year is that Pirelli is making the tires more resilient. The drivers had become frustrated with the performance of tires that were thermally unstable and rapidly degraded when drivers entered the hole in the air created by the car they were following, called slipstreaming, significantly reducing grip and damaging their prospects of overtaking.  Photo        The Red Bull driver Max Verstappen of the Netherlands, on the track during the final day of Formula One winter testing at Circuit de Barcelona-Catalunya in Spain.   Credit Dan Istitene/Getty Images    With the new tires, the drivers can push them far harder and for longer. But the resiliency of tires has long been a back-and-forth issue for Formula One. The downside of longer-lasting tires is fewer pit stops, removing a strategic element from the race. A few years ago, Bridgestone was the tire supplier for Formula One and provided a resilient tire that could have lasted an entire race  even though the rules required at least one pit stop to change tires. That made for some tedious races. Pirelli became the supplier for 2011, and its more degradable tire resulted in two to three pit stops per race. That made the races more exciting, but critics, including some drivers, complained, saying there were too many pit stops. So Formula One is back to a longer-lasting tire. Paul Hembery, the Pirelli motorsport boss, said there should still be some degradation with the new tires, but nothing compared with recent years. He said there is no middle ground with the issue.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   In the perfect world, you would have a level of degradation that creates strategy, but unfortunately you cannot pick and choose the characteristics because they are all interlinked, he said in an interview. As a byproduct of creating a more thermally stable tire youve taken away the degradation, and you are only looking at wear as the major reason for making changes, he said. It means we do foresee the majority, if not all the races, moving towards one stop. With the changes to the cars and tires, there is a high level of anticipation going into the new season, and that will only increase if Ferrari and Red Bull can pose a threat to Mercedes, which has won the drivers and constructors championships for the last three seasons. In testing, Ferrari seemed to have improved after a winless 2016, its second such campaign during the last three years. Hamilton, the top driver for Mercedes, said Ferrari was very close, if not faster than Mercedes, a point rejected by the Ferrari driver Sebastian Vettel, a four-time champion, who insisted Mercedes remained the ones to beat. It was all preseason mind games, with testing often difficult to read. There is no doubt Formula One needs Ferrari and Red Bull to run close to Mercedes this season. It needs that entertainment, particularly in the first season of the new owner, the Liberty Media Corporation, which is eager to attract new fans. Even Wolff of Mercedes admits that from what he has seen from testing, the big three are close together. Whether that will be the picture in Melbourne, or later, I dont know because the fuel weights can vary a lot in testing, he said, referring to how that weight affects lap times.

But on the other hand, there is the fan in me that wants to see competitive racing.

He said he would alter rules imposed by his predecessor to raise fuel standards.   Credit Stephen Crowley/The New York Times     A common piece of wisdom in business circles is that regulation is bad and stifles innovation. But that leaves us with the curious case of electric cars , as Farhad Manjoo writes . Electric cars are becoming less expensive and more reliable. The typical range they can drive on a single charge is extending, and charging stations are becoming more commonplace. Whats more, electric cars are spreading from innovative high-end companies like Tesla , an automaker based in Palo Alto, Calif., to mainstream manufacturers in the United States, China, Japan and areas of Europe. There are lots of reasons for this, but one above all: The whole industry is being pushed by regulation, both at the federal level and in the nine states that have adopted a zero-emission plan created by regulators in California, Mr. Manjoo writes. Not surprisingly, many auto companies disagree with that sentiment, arguing that gradual acceptance of the technology and more affordable prices have contributed to the cars popularity.

And thats too bad, because had there been, the talented Michael Pena wouldnt have had to work so hard to hold this minimally amusing mess together. As Ponch, an undercover federal agent investigating corruption in the California Highway Patrol, Mr. Pena struggles to make his character more than a walking erection. Thats tough when your new partner, Jon (Dax Shepard, who also wrote and directed), seems so fixated on his own equipment that he keeps forcing you to look at it. The mixed messages are clamorous. Exhibitionism aside, Jon is a battle-scarred motocross rider who has joined the patrol to impress his estranged wife (Kristen Bell, Mr. Shepards real-life spouse). Together, the partners chase unidentifiable men in full-face helmets and converse about what constitutes an acceptable masturbation schedule. A corpulent and clearly embarrassed Vincent DOnofrio slips in and out of the frame as a dirty cop, and the delightful Rosa Salazar, playing a sexily competent colleague, deserves much more attention than the hardware-obsessed script is willing to give her. I dont think we went more than three days on this movie without blowing something up, Mr. Shepard says in the publicity notes, betraying the pictures true intent. Yet beyond checking genre boxes, the action sequences, while undeniably flashy, often have debatable narrative utility. The accomplished cinematographer Mitchell Amundsen brings what context he can to the pyrotechnics, but not even he can perk up the movies drearily staged indoor setups. Focusing his camera intently on a cats backside, he must surely have been questioning his life choices.

Taxes on imported cars have become a growing area of friction between the United States and China.   Credit Aly Song/Reuters     BEIJING  A Jeep Wrangler can cost $30,000 more in China than in the United States  and the reasons illustrate a growing point of tension between the two countries. Manufactured in Toledo, Ohio, the Wrangler is a descendant of the jeeps that were used by American forces in World War II. Equipped with a 3.6-liter engine and a five-speed automatic transmission, the Rubicon edition of the Wrangler has a suggested retail price of $40,530 in the United States. But in China, the same vehicle would set a buyer back by a hefty $71,000, mostly because of taxes that Beijing charges on every car, minivan and sport utility vehicle that is made in another country and brought to Chinas shores. Those taxes on imported cars have become a growing area of friction between the United States and China. American former officials and current advisers to President Trump say that concern about the widening United States deficit in automotive trade has become a pressing issue ahead of the presidents meeting in Florida next month with his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping .   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   Hinting at potentially tough talks to come, Lawrence H. Summers, a former Treasury secretary, raised the issue of auto trade in the first question to Li Keqiang, Chinas premier, at a closed-door meeting on Monday, participants in the meeting said on the condition of anonymity because the discussions were private.  Continue reading the main story         Advertisement   Continue reading the main story       Mr. Li did not answer the question directly, the people said, instead responding that every country faced trade issues, and that China had its own trade deficits with a few countries, like Australia, from which it imports a lot of raw material. Mr. Trump has made trade a major issue, saying he wants a level playing field and similar terms on both sides. Partly because of Chinas taxes, less than 5 percent of cars in the country are imported , compared with one-quarter in the United States. Major American, European and Japanese carmakers have built huge assembly factories in China with the help of local partners, contributing to Chinas rise as the worlds largest automaker. Mostly because of taxes in China, an imported car can be double the price when compared with a domestically produced car, said Bill Russo, the former chief executive of Chrysler China. This acts as a powerful motivation, especially for mass-market brands, to localize their products in China. (The online news organization Axios reported recently on potential political tensions between China and the United States over the auto industry.) But the industry dynamics are complex. American auto companies, which have come to depend on China as a major source of revenue, have been largely quiet despite Mr. Trumps statements. Building cars in China keeps them close to a vast Chinese supply chain and saves on transportation costs.

Pricing can depend on factors like taxes, shipping, certification costs, equipment options, the size of the market and other details, said Ariel Gavilan, a Fiat Chrysler spokesman, in an emailed reply to questions. We also take a look at the competitive landscape  i.e. what are the prices of the vehicles we compete against  before determining our pricing strategy. Industry figures have also long talked about the possibility of exporting big volumes of China-made cars to the United States. In an early test, General Motors started shipping the Buick Envision model from a factory in eastern Chinas Shandong Province to the United States last year. That decision irritated the United Automobile Workers union. G.M. officials said that the Envision, a midsize sport utility vehicle, was designed for the Chinese market and is made only at the Shandong factory.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   There is only a small chance that Chinese automakers would set up assembly plants in the United States, the way Japanese automakers did in the 1980s to allay trade tensions. Chinas highly fragmented industry includes a number of fairly small manufacturers producing low-cost models, making the economics difficult, while Chinese automakers must still deal with quality problems. Parts are also an issue. In January, the most recent month for which data is available, the United States had $817 million in automotive exports to China, including finished cars and auto parts, and $1.71 billion in automotive imports. Still, American negotiators might have better luck in that area, as some Chinese parts makers are already investing in the United States to diversify. Fuyao, one of the worlds largest makers of automotive glass, has built a large factory in Ohio to supply car-assembly plants in the state. Officials with Fuyao have been criticized on social media in China, however, for investing offshore instead of keeping jobs within China. Fuyao declined to comment on its plans in the United States. Yale Zhang, the managing director of Automotive Foresight, a Shanghai consulting firm, said Fuyaos Ohio factory could be the start of a larger trend that might help soothe trade frictions. Those large local suppliers are willing to invest in the U.S., he said. It wont be a major issue for those large, local suppliers. They are willing to do that.

The Uber vehicle, which had a person in the drivers seat but was in self-driving mode, was not at fault in the accident, according to Josie Montenegro, a Tempe Police Department spokeswoman.

Earlier in March, The New York Times reported the existence of a tool called Greyball , which Uber engineers used to skirt authorities cracking down on Uber drivers worldwide. In addition, Travis Kalanick, Ubers chief executive, was forced to apologize for his aggressive behavior after Bloomberg published video of a verbal altercation he had with an Uber driver. Although Uber was not at fault in the Arizona accident, the incident is problematic for the company, a start-up based in San Francisco, which has gone head-to-head with regulators as it has tried to persuade cities to allow public testing of its autonomous vehicles. Google, General Motors and Ford Motor Company are all testing autonomous vehicles in California and have registered to do so.

The permits require companies to disclose the number of accidents their vehicles have been involved in. Shortly after the San Francisco testing began, one of Ubers self-driving cars failed to recognize a stoplight and sailed through a crosswalk . The car was driving itself at the time, according to internal documents reviewed by The Times. After the California Department of Motor Vehicles revoked the registrations for Ubers self-driving cars, the company took its vehicles to Arizona for testing , where the governor did not require the company to seek autonomous testing permits. Google, which has long tested self-driving vehicles in California, has also been in a number of accidents over the years. Typically, those accidents have been the fault of the other drivers. Auto companies working on self-driving technology face the difficulty of building smarter vehicles that must not only adhere to the rules of the road but must also account for the error-prone nature of human drivers, a far more difficult variable.

Credit Ramin Rahimian for The New York Times     The long-running rivalry between Uber and Google has taken many twists and turns. The two companies have been competing to hire talent and to race ahead of each other in technologies like driverless cars. Now, the latest fracas between the technology behemoths is heading into uncertain legal waters. It all began last month, when Googles sister company that focuses on self-driving cars, Waymo, sued Uber for using stolen intellectual property in its autonomous vehicles. Though the case could eventually end up going to trial, Uber made a push on Wednesday for parts of the lawsuit to be settled through arbitration, writes Daisuke Wakabayashi, a tech reporter for The New York Times. Specifically, Uber revealed in a new court document that Waymo previously pursued arbitration with Anthony Levandowski, who formerly worked on Googles self-driving cars and is now the head of Ubers autonomous car unit. According to the filing, Waymo went the arbitration route with Mr. Levandowski last October over its contention that he tried to hire Google employees by using confidential salary information from the company. Its unclear what the outcome of the arbitration was.  Newsletter Sign Up  Continue reading the main story  Interested in All Things Tech?

A deal with SoftBank could help Didi Chuxing contend with a rash of difficulties.   Credit Alberto Estevez/European Pressphoto Agency     HONG KONG  Didi Chuxing, a company in China that last year bested Uber in that huge ride-sharing market, is in negotiations to get SoftBank of Japan to take part in a multibillion-dollar investment round, according to people familiar with the talks. Should a deal be reached, it could be the latest big bet that SoftBanks eccentric leader, Masayoshi Son, has placed on a significant technology company. Mr. Son has been raising $100 billion for what he calls the SoftBank Vision Fund and has already pledged to invest $50 billion and create 50,000 jobs in the United States. While it is unclear whether that fund is involved in the talks over Didi Chuxing, analysts say it could be further used to make sizable investments in big, global tech companies. A deal could also help Didi Chuxing, which counts Apple among its powerful backers , contend with a rash of difficulties. Since the company bought Ubers business in China in the summer to form a business valued at $35 billion, it has been mired in regulatory pressures . Still, executives at the company have said that they harbor international ambitions, and it is pushing aggressively to catch up in the development of driverless car technologies. A deal with SoftBank is also intended to increase Didi Chuxings value, said one of the people familiar with the talks.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   It is unclear whether Didi Chuxing will reach a deal with SoftBank and at what amount or whether it will involve other investors. The people familiar with the talks spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly about the discussions. Bloomberg earlier reported the talks on Tuesday.  Continue reading the main story         Advertisement   Continue reading the main story       The fund-raising efforts by Didi Chuxing show how foreign investors currently value dominance in China, an internet market largely closed to foreign competition that has the largest smartphone-using populace in the world. A new multibillion-dollar round would also put Didi roughly on par with the total funds raised by Uber. It has also raised money at home from the two biggest internet companies in China: Alibaba, an e-commerce giant, and Tencent, a games and social media conglomerate. Didi Chuxings longer-term expansion is likely to be closely watched as a touchstone of the prospects of Chinas homegrown internet champions. The company has a number of high-profile investors, both Chinese and foreign, and whether it develops important technology for autonomous cars or is able to expand into other markets will become a new barometer for the abilities of companies that have grown large in Chinas relatively isolated market.

Privacy Policy  Opt out or contact us anytime      Along with receiving a bigger valuation, analysts said Didi would most likely use the money to invest in next-generation technology, like autonomous vehicles, and potentially also on international expansion, though the company has so far done little outside its domestic market. Didi has been content to invest in and work with a band of similar ride-hailing companies in India, Southeast Asia and America. The partners include Ubers main rival in the United States, Lyft . It is uncertain whether Didi would consider introducing its own service to challenge those partners as part of an international push, look to other markets in developing countries or continue to invest in promising companies. Even so, the company has put money into recruiting foreign talent. In March, Didi said it was creating a research and development lab in Silicon Valley that is focused on developing artificial-intelligence technologies to help with security and driverless cars. It also said that it would use A.I. to aid it in the data analytics required to improve transportation in Chinas many traffic-snarled cities. As a part of the effort, the company poached Charlie Miller, a well-known computer scientist who once worked for Uber. Yet even as it speeds ahead with technology, Didi has faced a more prosaic challenge at home. New rules in China that have required drivers in some of the countrys biggest cities to have registration documents have pinched the companys ability to respond to customer demand. Regulations have had a direct impact on the supply of cars, said Xue Yu, a senior analyst at IDC, a market research firm. For customers, it will be a lot more difficult to order a car than before the new regulations were announced, Mr. Xue said. This has largely raised the operation costs for Didi.

Credit Eric Risberg/Associated Press     SAN FRANCISCO  An Uber executive accused of stealing driverless car technology from his former employers at Google is exercising his Fifth Amendment right to avoid self-incrimination, according to his lawyers. The lawyers for Anthony Levandowski, the former head of Googles self-driving car project who is now leading a similar effort at Uber, said he was broadly asserting his Fifth Amendment rights because there was potential for criminal action in the case, according to court transcripts obtained on Thursday. The legal maneuver adds even more intrigue to the high-profile fight between two of the technology industrys largest companies, which are squaring off in the race to put driverless cars on the road. Mr. Levandowski is at the center of a lawsuit between Uber and Waymo , which was spun out from Google to become its own Alphabet subsidiary. Waymo has accused Mr. Levandowski of stealing documents and poaching employees before quitting Google and then colluding with Uber to use that technology to advance driverless car efforts at the ride-hailing service.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   Shortly after leaving Google, Mr. Levandowski started his own self-driving truck start-up, Otto. Six months after Otto was formed, Uber acquired the company for $680 million . Waymo filed a motion seeking a temporary injunction this month to stop Ubers autonomous vehicle development.  Continue reading the main story         Advertisement   Continue reading the main story       As part of the motion seeking the injunction, Waymo said that Mr. Levandowski, while still working at Google, installed software that allowed him to download over 14,000 files, or about 9.7 gigabytes of data, pertaining to the driverless car program. Uber was ordered to hand over those files. In the transcript of a private hearing before Judge William Alsup in United States District Court in San Francisco, Mr. Levandowskis lawyers said he was invoking his Fifth Amendment right to avoid self-incrimination in not turning over documents that may pertain to the case. Arturo Gonzalez, one of Ubers lawyers, said they have made clear to Mr. Levandowski that he needs to release any documents relevant to the case as part of discovery. We obviously have a conflict, he said. Miles Ehrlich, one of the lawyers representing Mr. Levandowski, said the Uber executive was asserting his Fifth Amendment rights to protect against compelled disclosure that would identify the existence, location or possession of any responsive documents. He also said that Mr. Levandowskis decision to invoke the Fifth Amendment may change as they examine the case.

When Ubers lawyer told the court that the company could not force him to testify, Judge Alsup said Uber had the right to order him to cooperate or be fired. Without arguing about whether or not Mr. Levandowski stole documents, Ubers lawyer said the company intended to prove that its driverless car technology was not stolen from Waymo. The more we get into this, it might look like a public relations disaster for Uber, said Michael Carrier, a law professor at Rutgers University. The mere fact that youre pleading the Fifth doesnt look good. The acquisition of Otto and the hiring of Mr. Levandowski was critical for Uber. It is betting that autonomous cars are essential to its future, allowing it to run a fleet of cars around the clock without having to pay drivers. Angela Padilla, Ubers associate general counsel, said in a statement that the company plans to publicly lay out its case on April 7. We are very confident that Waymos claims against Uber are baseless and that Anthony Levandowski has not used any files from Google in his work with Otto or Uber, she said. A Waymo spokesman declined to comment. Ubers lawyers tried to keep the hearing confidential, arguing that it could harm Mr. Levandowskis reputation. Judge Alsup dismissed that argument.
