The search for Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 has helped create maps revealing the ocean floors topographical complexity.   Credit Kim Picard and Jonah Sullivan     On March 8, 2014, Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 vanished with 239 passengers and crew aboard as it crossed the Indian Ocean, triggering a large-scale search for its remains that lasted nearly three years . As a byproduct of the tragedy, scientists have gained access to more than 100,000 square miles of seafloor mapped at a level of detail that provides a rare look at the oceans geological processes. Its an incredible trove of data, said Millard F. Coffin , a marine geophysicist from the Institute for Marine and Antarctic Studies at the University of Tasmania in Australia. Ive been working in this part of the Indian Ocean for 30-plus years and over many voyages in the eastern Indian Ocean Ive never seen this level of resolution. Dr. Coffin worked with a group of about 10 scientists from Geoscience Australia , the national geosciences agency in Australia, to analyze data from the search. They were given access to high-resolution sonar information collected on ships, and data obtained by remotely operated vehicles and autonomous underwater drones. The information was provided by the Australian Transport Safety Bureau , which led the search. When we look at these data, were constantly keeping in mind that we wouldnt have this data if it werent for a terrible tragedy, Dr. Coffin said. He and his colleagues published a summary of their findings on Wednesday in the journal EOS .  Photo        A 3-D model of the Broken Ridge along the Diamantina Escarpment.   Credit Geoscience Australia    Previous satellite data provided scientists with information about the Indian Ocean at a resolution of about five square kilometers, or about two square miles. With the instruments from the search ships, they have collected information at a resolution of meters, and in some locations they have used remote operating vehicles and underwater autonomous vehicles to gain detail on the scale of centimeters.

The Flight 370 search also provided information about tectonic and volcanic activity, Dr. Coffin said.  Continue reading the main story         Advertisement   Continue reading the main story       The team plans to release more detailed looks into its findings later in the year, and the full data set from the search will be made available in the middle of the year. Walter H.F. Smith, a geophysicist with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, said the hunt for the lost jetliner highlighted how little we know about the oceans. In a paper that was also published Wednesday in the journal EOS , he and his colleagues explained how common unmapped areas of ocean are.     Graphic  How Missing Jets Debris Could Have Floated to Reunion  This animation shows where floating debris from Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 could have drifted if experts are correct about where the plane went down.         OPEN Graphic      There are all kinds of things you cant do if you dont know the shape of the ocean bottom, or dont know it properly, Dr. Smith said. The consequences of not knowing, he said, can hinder how experts predict tsunamis, understand ocean currents, make climate forecasts, study marine life and search for missing planes. Previous studies have suggested that only 8 percent of the worlds oceans have been mapped, meaning that a ship measured an areas depth and recorded it in a scientific database. Before Flight 370s disappearance, only 5 percent of the southeast Indian Ocean had been mapped, Dr. Smith said. To figure out how often people fly over unmapped parts of the worlds oceans, Dr. Smith and his colleagues compared data on mapped and unmapped segments of the worlds ocean segments with a database of commercial airline routes . They found that about 60 percent of all commercial flights that cross over the ocean travel over waters with unmeasured depths. The longest contiguous route over unmapped ocean was from Kennedy International Airport in New York to Chongqing Jiangbei International Airport in China, a journey over more than 1,200 nautical miles of unmapped ocean. I wanted people to realize that its not just Malaysia Airlines straying into the southeast Indian Ocean where it shouldnt have been, he said. Even when your aircraft is exactly where its supposed to be, it might be over unknown ocean.   Like the Science Times page on Facebook. | Sign up for the Science Times newsletter.

He also has a neat trick or two. Image Christophe Robin, the star colorist, at his pop-up shop in New York. Credit Joanna Nikas/The New York Times By  Bee Shapiro April 24, 2017 Washing your hair should be as basic as slipping on your favorite bluejeans. After all, the process would seem rote at this point. But if the clients at Christophe Robins Paris salon are any indication, there is plenty of confusion. Thats my most asked question at the salon now: How do I wash my hair? said Mr. Robin, the star colorist who tends the locks of Catherine Deneuve and Tilda Swinton. Part of the problem is the baffling messaging about shampooing: Women have been told they are both overwashing and underwashing . A lot of this is also from all the products we have out there now, Mr. Robin said. And women are so often in a rush. You have to cleanse properly. You have to take time to make sure you rinse all the products out. Here, Mr. Robin offers a tutorial on the right way to shampoo. He also has some tips for maximizing shine and volume, all without styling products: Step 1: First detangle hair with a quality brush. Mr. Robin recommends starting at the ends. Then double back to the roots to finish the process. You detangle first so that way you dont have to detangle hair after, when its wet, he said. You never should use a comb on hair that is wet. Its very stressing on the hair. Step 2: Before shampooing, apply a vegetable-derived oil to the ends of hair and brush to disperse. Mr. Robin uses the moisturizing hair oil with lavender ($44) from his namesake line, but he said pure almond oil or argan oil would do as well. Ideally, you would leave the oil on overnight, but even a good 15 minutes will be beneficial. Then you can skip the conditioner. I dont love conditioners, Mr. Robin said. They can weigh your hair down. Step 3: Wash with the cleanser best suited to your hair type. The problem is, some women are not choosing the right shampoo for their hair, he said. Considering the sulfate-free trend in hair care lately, he noted that colored hair should never be treated with sulfate products but that sometimes a sulfate shampoo, which has a stronger detergent, is appropriate for someone who has virgin hair and greasy roots. Curlier hair, he explained, tends to be drier and can benefit from co-washing  that is, washing with a nonfoaming, conditioning cleanser as a substitute for shampoo. Mr. Robin released one of the first luxury brand co-washes some 20 years ago, his cleansing mask with lemon ($49). Mr. Robin said most women used too much product: You should use only about a teaspoon and then you emulsify that with water. Lather only the roots of your hair with your fingertips (not your nails), avoiding the ends. To increase volume and circulation, shampoo with your head upside down. Step 4: Rinse thoroughly. This is actually a big problem because people are not taking enough time to rinse out all the product, Mr. Robin said. Hair should be squeaky clean. Step 5: If you decide to add a conditioner, apply only to the ends. Mr. Robin recommends a deep conditioning mask once a week to address various hair issues, including brittleness or brassy color. Step 6: Dont rub hair dry. Mr. Robin demonstrated a Moroccan tip he learned to detangle and lift the roots: Flip your head upside down and run a towel over it from both sides quickly, he said. The towels flicking motion will also remove excess water. Bonus Tip: Mr. Robin acknowledges that his washing process may take more time than the usual regimens, but that if done correctly, the method can make each shampoo last longer. Most women should not be washing more than twice a week, he said. That is not to say that dry shampoo is the answer for the other days. Dry shampoo should only give you maybe one night or one day extra, he said. Instead, especially for active women, a few spritzes of a vinegar solution at the roots will remove oil. (Just add five drops of apple cider vinegar to five ounces of water in a spray bottle.) Mr. Robin added, Unlike dry shampoo, theres no residue, and the vinegar is a wonderful tonic for the scalp.

Credit Nina Westervelt for The New York Times     Rather than roast in the sun, and in all likelihood bring on sun damage, sun spots and other hot weather woes, self-tanner has become a reliable solution for faking a bronzed glow. The formulas have been improved so much  less streaky! less orange!  that, with some practice, you can use them to contour. The makeup artist Charlotte Tilbury has plenty of personal experience with the product. Being one of the whitest girls in the world, and with my red hair, I was obsessed with how to get the best self-tan, she said. Sometimes she starts with a self-tan base and then enhances her color during the day with a light dusting of bronzer or layers on a sheer tint to add depth. All in all, the goal is to cheat, she said, adding, Its to look leaner and longer and also more youthful and glowing. Here, Ms. Tilbury walks us through the self-tanner application process, adding a few tips and tricks for carving out cheekbones and elongating limbs.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   Streamline Your Limbs STEP 1 To ensure an even application, you should prep the skin with a body exfoliator to remove dead skin. This way, the self-tan wont grab onto any dead skin cells, said Ms. Tilbury, who prefers Tatcha Indigo Smoothing Black Sugar Body Gommage ($74). She rubs the scrub up and down and then in circular motions for a thorough finish.  Continue reading the main story         Advertisement   Continue reading the main story       STEP 2 Blot the skin completely dry. STEP 3 Add self-tanner to an applicator mitt. Ms. Tilbury likes Loving Tan bronzing mousse ($34.95), which she discovered from the beauty bloggers Desi Perkins and Katy DeGroot, a.k.a. Lustrelux , for its believable color. Then apply in circular motions on arms, legs and other desired areas before pulling the product upward.

For tricky areas like the elbows and ankles, where self-tanner may be prone to stick, she adds some of her Magic Cream moisturizer ($100) after the self-tanner to help the product spread more easily. STEP 4 Use the self-tanner base about two or three days in a row. Once you have a base, you can start contouring your body and cheating to make yourself look longer and leaner, Ms. Tilbury said. With the mitt or a big round brush, apply self-tanner down only the sides of the legs, while using small circular motions so you wont be left with an obvious streak. Repeat these steps on the outer sides of the arms.

Ms. Tilbury likes the Enzyme Peeling Mask by Georgia Louise ($120). STEP 2 Overnight self-tanners have come into vogue in recent years. Ms. Tilbury created her own, the Overnight Bronze and Glow Mask ($55), to moisturize and calm the skin as well as deliver a wash of color. Whatever product you choose, she said, it is important that it has moisturizing agents, so it doesnt attach to freckles, and that the color is very, very subtle. Apply all over, as you would a moisturizer, she said, and then make sure you go up into the hairline, under and down the neck, and into the decolletage. And when youre doing your cheeks, she continued, dont forget to drag up to your ears.

Ms. Tilburys version is called Healthy Glow ($40) and is meant to be unisex. Apply in the same way as you would self-tanner.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   STEP 4 Once youre familiar with your self-tanning product, you can try creating definition. After using the self-tanner over your entire face for two or three days in a row, use a large brush to apply self-tanner to just your cheekbones and jawline. Suck in your cheeks and follow the hollows with circular motions up to the temple. Then, using the same brush, sweep self-tanner along the jawline. Be sure to blend, using the same concise circular motions. STEP 5 But leave the more complicated contouring to makeup, Ms. Tilbury advised. Its tough to shape your chin or nose with self-tanner, she said. It can easily get dodgy. Using her Filmstar Bronze and Glow duo ($68), she applies the contour color to further deepen the cheek hollows and jawline. Then she dusts the highlighter color on top of the cheekbones, down the nose and on the bow of the mouth.

And while summer may bring with it beachy waves and sun-kissed cheeks, it also presents many problems of its own. Here, we offer solutions to some common ones.      Photo          Credit Luci Gutierrez     Try a new do    Treat hair like you do your skin, said Jeannette Graf, a dermatologist in Manhattan and Great Neck, N.Y. The sun compromises the cuticle, the outer protective layer of the hair, and over time can make it brittle and dull. The first line of defense is tying it back, whether in a simple ponytail or an effortful plaited style.      Photo          Credit Luci Gutierrez     Find your hair-washing happy place    What you do in the wintertime is not what youre going to do in the summer, said Eva Scrivo, a hairstylist with two salons in Manhattan. For some people, washing less often makes sense, as natural hair oils can help offset frizz. Others might need to ramp up their regimen with products like texturizing spray, smoothing fluid and leave-in conditioner. And remember: There are always swim caps.      Photo          Credit Luci Gutierrez     Wrap it up    While you might wear a headwrap to cover what is underneath, Paola Mathe, the creator of Fanm Djanm , sees it as an expression of personal style. Its this beautiful, powerful accessory that promotes strength and power and culture, she said. Protection from sun damage is an added bonus.           Photo          Credit Luci Gutierrez     Know that SPF is just a number    There is no such thing as 100 percent UV protection  not even from a sunscreen with an SPF of 110. But when applied correctly (that is, greasing up with a full ounce of product every two hours), a product labeled SPF 30 lets you stay in the sun without getting burned 30 times longer than if you were wearing no sunscreen at all. Using a water-resistant sport sunscreen , like NO-AD Sport SPF 50, a favorite of the researchers at The Sweethome , can also help you beat the burn.      Photo          Credit Luci Gutierrez     Give your pores a break    If you can afford it, a summer facial can help mitigate sun damage and oily skin. At Heyday in New York, treatments start at $60. An appointment with a top facialist, on the other hand, could cost you as much as $500. Most appointments will include extractions, deep cleansing and product consultations. As Georgia Louise, a sought-after Upper East Side facialist, put it, Your skin needs to breathe.      Photo          Credit Luci Gutierrez     Wear less    When you perspire, you are a setup for all kinds of things to go awry, said Macrene Alexiades-Armenakas, a dermatologist in Manhattan. But that doesnt mean you need to skip makeup altogether. Eve Kessner, an instructor at SoulCycle, puts on Eyeko Sport Waterproof Mascara and a face luminizer by RMS Beauty or Josie Maran Cosmetics before she leaves the house. And a number of companies, including Birchbox and Sweat Cosmetics, now sell products they call workout-proof.

Although, I was not fully aware of what this meant at age 7, there are no words to describe the feelings that flooded over me when my family landed at Miami International Airport, when I realized that we were here to stay. The process of being accepted as a refugee into the United States is a nightmare. It took us 10 months of exhausting interviews, paperwork and medical tests. After fleeing Baghdad, and spending a year as illegal refugees in Jordan, that moment meant everything. It breaks my heart that in 2017, there are some trying to steal this moment from countless individuals whose promise of a new life will be broken  families no different from mine, who deserve a second chance but who wont get one. President Trumps executive order on immigration is not merely illegal and unconstitutional, but also heartless and discriminatory.

It should be noted that while Mr. Trumps ban covers these countries, which have produced exactly zero people linked to terrorist attacks that have killed Americans since 1975 to 2015, the ban does not cover countries like Turkey, Egypt, the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia, with which the Trump family has business interests and whose citizens have been linked to terrorist attacks that have killed Americans. In addition to that, terrorism by Muslims as opposed to American Christian lone gunmen accounts for just one third of 1 percent of all murders in the United States.

A few weeks ago when returning to the United States from Dubai, my family was selected for a random security check. This one was more thorough than ever. I had to hold back tears as everyone in line passed while they were dissecting my bag like I was some sort of criminal. My crime? The American passport that I carry says that I was born in Iraq. My father asked the man why the security check was taking so much longer than usual. The man replied simply with America first, but how do you put America first when you are destroying the very values it was founded upon? Works Cited Board, The Editorial.

More Like Ameri-Cant Vote Gianni Carcagno, age 17 There are over four million people living in the five permanently inhabited island territories of the United States. The residents of these territories  Guam, the Virgin Islands, the Northern Mariana Islands, American Samoa and Puerto Rico  are Americans who follow the Constitution, serve in the U.S. military and vote in presidential primaries. However, unless citizens establish an official residency in a U.S. state (and vote by absentee ballot or travel to their state to vote), they cannot vote in U.S. presidential elections or receive any substantial representation at a national level. It is time for the U.S. to stop infantilizing its territories and to grant them voting and other rights equal to the mainland states. The Supreme Court decision that denied equal rights to the territories was made over 100 years ago. Not only was the verdict intended to be temporary, but it was also made by the same justice who approved the separate but equal doctrine in Plessy v. Ferguson. The ruling denies territories rights outlined in constitutional amendments because the territories are inhabited by alien races unable to understand Anglo-Saxon principles. This blatantly discriminatory decision is still used today against U.S. territory citizens fighting for equal rights. Inequality for the territories is also prevalent in Congress and bureaucracy. All U.S. territories elect representation into the House of Representatives; however, their Congressmen have no voting power on legislation. Guam and American Samoa specifically receive unfair treatment from the government despite their overwhelming large military enrollment. One-eighth of Guams population is enrolled in the U.S. military and American Samoa has the highest rate of military enlistment in the U.S., yet citizens in both territories do not vote for their commander-in-chief, have adequate representation in Congress, or receive equal veteran benefits to mainland citizens.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   It is even more difficult to acquire the right to vote in American Samoa because American Samoans, unlike other territory residents, are not born U.S. citizens. They are instead called nationals to accommodate their cultural distinctiveness. In order to vote, American Samoans must move to a U.S. state and become naturalized as if they were immigrating from another country. This process costs almost $700 and includes tests in English, U.S. history and civics. The naturalization process is comparable to poll taxes and literacy tests  forms of voting discrimination outlawed by the 24th Amendment  and further highlights unjustifiable bias of the U.S. government against its territories, simply because of cultural differences. It is time for the U.S. to acknowledge its disrespectful and isolating treatment of its territories and give their neglected citizens the rights they deserve. Works Cited Murriel, Maria.

It is vital that schools teach about the climate-caused tragedies that are occurring globally and how to combat climate injustice. Fortunately, some school districts are taking steps to ensure that this is done. In 2016 the Portland, Ore., school board unanimously passed a resolution supporting the teaching of climate justice. In the New York Times article, Setbacks Aside, Climate Change is Finding its Way into the Worlds Classroom, Alexander Leicht of Unesco states [to slow climate change] we need an overall change of mind and a change of action that relates to everything that we think and do. Education can provide this essential change in perspective that will ultimately help the generations to come.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   However, actions like Portlands are still relatively rare. There are too many cases of state legislatures, school districts and teachers actively denying the fact that climate change is real, or bowing to pressure from community members and corporations who value short-term profits over long-term climate stability. Even when teachers and school districts want to teach the facts about climate change, many classroom resources discount the science behind climate change. Holt McDougals textbook, Modern World History, published in 2010, includes misleading statements questioning the legitimacy of the climate crisis such as, not all scientists agree with the theory of the greenhouse effect. This statement falsely leads students to believe that there is not a wide scientific consensus about climate change. Fossil fuel industry funding of curriculums also poses a huge obstacle to eliminating misinformation about climate change. Energy corporations are paying for materials to be developed that promote fossil fuel usage and production. In the Washington Post article, Energy Industry Shapes Lessons in Public Schools, Kevin Sieff writes, The industry aims to teach students about its contributions to local economies and counter criticism from environmental groups. These resources are often biased and factually incorrect. Actions like Portlands demonstrate that schools can address climate change in the classroom. It is essential that cities around the nation follow their lead because we, as the future generation, deserve to know what we are facing and what we can do to fix this crisis that we did not create. As Portland student Gaby Lemieux says, Climate education is not a niche or a specialization, it is the minimum requirement for my generation to be successful in our changing world.

Within days, dozens of demonstrators showed up to block the painting from view, and over 25 black artists signed an open letter to the Whitneys curators demanding that the painting be destroyed due to its cultural appropriation of black suffering for profit and fun. Cultural appropriation is the adoption of elements of one culture by members of another culture. What makes the protests at the Whitney Museum so frustratingly sad isnt just the call for a museum to destroy a piece of artwork. Instead it is the objection that a white artist has no right to paint a subject like a lynching victim that entirely misses the point. What these critics  the same people who would protest against the routine stop and frisking of innocent black people, the vulgar accusations made by President Trump caricaturing Mexican immigrants, and the harassment of Muslim-American families  fail to realize is that cultural appropriation can actually be used to heighten empathy and stop these injustices. The truth is that people, even the most sympathetic ones, tend to view victims from disparate racial groups as separate from themselves. Again and again, politicians, reporters and television broadcasters reflect this trend. No one wants any child to be kidnapped, writes journalist Conor Friedersdorf, but the little blond girl leads the local news; her black analog might not make the newscast... [Dana Schutz] was trying to bridge the gulf between us and them. Slavery and white supremacy are very real parts of American history, and white people ought to confront them no less than black people. To label such efforts as cultural appropriation lends credibility to the sort of racial rigidity that fuels racism in the first place. So while Dana Schutz is white and Emmett Till is black, the emphasis on racial essentialism here feels ludicrously, infuriatingly off topic. Sometimes a woman rendering painful moments in black history has nothing to do with whether she herself is white or black, but rather with the exposure of human pain. Combating racism must not only rely on racial equity in legislation, but also must allow for the full participation of every ethnic group, nationality and race. Ms. Schutzs painting itself is abstract and haunting  the ambiguous brush strokes across Tills face form a profoundly disquieting image. But this is to be expected of any painting that reopens the wounds of American racism. Call it whatever you will, but what Ms. Schutzs painting does is powerful and evokes emotion in the viewer.

What do the director of the IMF, the conservative political scientist, and the 66th secretary of state have in common? All three have been prevented from speaking on college campuses due to student protests. Campaigns by college students to block speakers from campus events have markedly increased in recent years. According to the Foundation for Individual Rights in Education, there have been 338 attempts by college students to prevent public figures from speaking at campus events since 2000. The annual number of disinvitation events has increased since 2011, with 2016 reaching a record high of 42 campaigns. The protests themselves are not the problem. Throughout history, protests have been the catalyst for political progress, from Gandhis salt march to the American Civil Rights movement. Instead, it is the motivation behind these college protests that provides a disservice to the students of today. Often, the reason for campaigns against speakers is the disparity between the politics or actions of the proposed speaker and the views of the student protesters. Many students hold that the beliefs of proposed speakers are so damaging that they should not be given a platform. The solution to a difference of opinion is not a violent refusal to listen. Discourse is necessary. By listening to and engaging with political opponents, students can strengthen their understanding of political issues and both sides can evolve their views. In an increasingly polarized political climate, an understanding of opposing viewpoints is crucial to developing and strengthening ones own ideology. By listening to speakers with different political views, students are afforded the unique opportunity to learn about contrary beliefs and their underlying reasoning. In turn, this understanding allows students to refine their positions and, therefore, to more effectively advocate for them. Vigorous and open debate also allows both sides the opportunity to engage in ideological development. One purpose of college is the ability to grow and change before venturing into the real world. Listening to a speaker with whom you already wholeheartedly agree is a merely a visit to the echo chamber. Exposure to new viewpoints may actually change the beliefs of students. Conversely, students who confront the speaker with informed questions and arguments may challenge the position of the speaker or sway other undecided listeners. Thus, for the benefit of students and the future of political discourse, the practice of blocking speakers on college campuses must stop. College students should continue to protest, but should also listen and demand respectful dialogue with speakers, no matter their politics. If we fail to listen, if we turn our backs on the opposition instead of arguing and engaging, then we have already lost.

The hero quickly realized what made the nine-headed beast so deadly. After decapitating one head, two more took its place. However, if he cauterized the wounds, the heads would not spawn, allowing Hercules to defeat this relentless foe. The moral is brute force may not be the sole solution. Three thousand years later, we do not fight sea monsters and impervious lions, but we need Herculess lesson more than ever. For the past 16 years our nation has been at a never-ending war with a similarly regenerating enemy: international terrorism. Former President Obama criticized his predecessors strategy for creating more terrorists than it killed, but his own pivot from conventional warfare to drone strikes was not the ideal solution either. President Trump appears to be embracing Obamas myopic tactics. On January 21 and 22, the United States conducted drone strikes in the Yemeni province of Bayda that claimed the lives of 75 people. Though such drone strikes successfully kill insurgents, new radicals always seem to spring up in their place. Could this new technology be moving us toward perpetual war rather than peace? Retired Gen. Stanley A. McChrystal, once responsible for the Joint Special Operations Command, says yes. During a Reuters interview, he argues that drones strengthen the perception of American arrogance that says, Well we can fly where we want, we can shoot where we want, because we can. Although these strikes eliminate enemies, General McChrystal stresses that radical groups use perceived American imperiousness to bolster their numbers faster than we kill them. Proponents claim this technological advantage enables us to remotely kill key targets like the Afghan Taliban leader Mullah Akhtar Mansour. However, these weapons short term gains cause more havoc than sustained peace. Just days after terminating Mullah Mansour, an even more ruthless and radical leader filled his position.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   The attack that killed Mullah Mansour also incinerated an innocent taxi driver name Mohammad Azam. The Bureau of Investigative Journalism states this humble cabdriver joined between 256 and 633 civilians who perished in United States drone strikes between January 2009 and December 2015. Our feigned progress leads us to ignore the innocent people who have been trampled and shallowly regarded as collateral damage. Our acceptance of these unintended deaths generate resentment, hatred and destabilization, creating a prime environment for spawning new radicals. The modern Hydra is more complex than its ancient Greek counterpart. However, its heads will continue to sprout even though our weapon is a Hellfire missile rather than Herculess club. We must discover how to seal the wounds rather than just inflict them, or our problems will grow exponentially. Works Cited Alexander, David. Retired General Cautions against Overuse of hated Drones.

Her skin turned paler with each name listed on the television. This time it was a group of first graders from a sandy hook. Standing in the kitchen with my backpack by my feet, I could not escape the visions of carnage. In school, we practice Code Red. We pile furniture against classroom doors and sit silently, holding our breath until reminded that it is just a drill. Wariness follows me home from school, its tentacles twisting my head.

I am mad because 16-year-olds are supposed to be angry with their parents and society and not having a date to the prom, but instead I have to be angry with lawmakers and the N.R.A. and an entire country that lets holsters and bazookas pull its puppet strings. I can fire off facts faster than an AR-15 rifle: last year, there were 358 shootings in the U.S. in which four or more people were injured or killed. 306 Americans are shot every day. 48 of those are children or teenagers. It does not have to be this way. Take Australia. After a shooting in 1996 left 35 civilians dead, extensive gun control legislature was passed. These new laws included required licenses, safety training courses and an assault weapons ban. In the twenty years since the legislature was passed, there have been no mass shootings in Australia. This is sensible action. This is making sure guns do not end up in the wrong hands. Dear lawmakers: I challenge you to think about the American people. Think about the 306 Americans who will feel bullets tearing into their skin tomorrow. Think about the American students holding their breath in the corners of dark classrooms.

In the Kingdom of the Little People theme park just outside Kunming, the capital of Yunnan Province, thats the norm. The park creates a safe space for little people in China, but still sources such as the L.P.A., Little People of America, believe the park is mocking dwarfism and isolating the handicapped community. The Kingdom of the Little People theme park should be kept running, because it gives little people a stable job and a safe space to be themselves.

According to the South China Morning Press, dwarves earn average pay packets of 1,500 yuan, equivalent to that of local college graduates. Though most dwarfs in China live in poverty, often times forced to beg on the streets, the dwarves at the park are paid well and many say that it changed their lives forever. Another big pull for dwarfs is to be finally in an environment where they arent the odd one out and they have a safe space to be with others like them. One of the performers at the park, Wu Zhihong, 20 said, Before, when we were at home, we didnt know anyone our size. When we hang out together with normal-size people, we cannot really do the same things. So I really felt lonely sometimes. Many of the workers felt isolated in their hometowns where most often they were the only person of short stature they knew. At the park they have a place to meet others they can relate to and reportedly many dwarfs find their first loves at the park. Some say the park is a human zoo and a place to gawk, but this is not the case. Most of the performers have nowhere else where they can have a stable life with friends similar to them. The performers all say that they wouldnt be the same if they hadnt worked at the Kingdom of the Little People. The park creates a safe space for little people in China to meet friends and get paid a comfortable salary. Without the park little people in China would live as lesser members of society subject to extreme ridicule. Ethics groups that oppose the park need to be shown the effect it has had on performers and how drastically different their lives would be without it.

Melody Markert, age 17 As my mom opened the box containing our new Amazon Echo, I was not shocked at the sheer amount of packaging that goes into shipping a nine-inch tall cylinder: It was enclosed in plastic, in a box, surrounded by Bubble Wrap, in yet another box. I should be glad that it keeps Alexa clean and protected, but I cannot overlook the amount of waste created. I recycled the cardboard, but the plastic? My neighborhood recycling plant only accepts plastic bottles. It does not have the facilities to break down the multilayered packaging economically. Instead, it went to the landfill, adding to the 14.4 million tons of plastic produced each year in America. Granted, we have made progress over the years. Since 2005, United States companies have already avoided creating 1.5 billion pounds of packaging waste. Even so, reducing the amount of packaging is not enough. We must eliminate it entirely in order to see any large progress.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   Zero waste stores have opened all across Europe in order to combat this issue. At Original Unverpackt, in Berlin, Germany, all of their products are out in the open, unobstructed by layers of plastic, paper or metal. Precycling removes trash before it is even created. Shoppers come in with sacks and totes buying local products while making conscious purchases. Few places generate as much waste as grocery stores. We consistently see produce individually wrapped in plastic. But why is this necessary? For thousands of years, people bought goods fresh and in bulk  free of any sort of packaging. Bulk items are still around now, but their sections are dwarfed by aisles and aisles of unnecessary packaging. These small areas do not dominate stores and therefore have very little influence on our buying habits. In America, a land full of supermarkets and large companies, it is more difficult to have zero waste and bulk markets because we want security and convenience. We pay for instant gratification rather than quality when we buy packaged food. If we want to reinvent grocery shopping, both the manufacturers and the consumers must take part. Many large corporations such as Nestle and WalMart have taken steps toward becoming more environmentally friendly, but lesser-known brands have made the most progress. They have responded to the demands of consumers, eliminating excessive packaging and sourcing from local and organic farms. We need to continue this movement toward zero waste by encouraging consumers to change their way of life and look toward the future of healthy, sustainable living, rather than being content with harming our planet. Bring your own bags. Buy food in bulk. Shop zero-waste. Small changes are all it takes to make a difference that extends far beyond our own homes. Works Cited Ball, Aimee Lee.

Related Article   Credit McKinney Independent School District    The Future Disintegration of American Democracy Through Athletics Julianne Yu, age 16 In 2012, Allen Independent School District in Texas spent $60 million on a new football stadium, at the time, the most expensive high school stadium ever. In fact, The New York Times reports that it has nearly the same capacity as Madison Square Garden. Now, McKinney Independent School District, adjacent to Allen I.S.D., is building a rival stadium for nearly $70 million. Thats the equivalent of providing school lunch to all of the 24,500 students in McKinney every day for six years. This is a remarkable misappropriation of money in a state that chronically underfunds education. As of last year, not only did Texas rank 43rd in the nation for education, it ranked 49th in per pupil spending. Nationally, the U.S. spent an average of $11,667 per student whereas Texas fell behind at $7,957 per student. But its not only Texas whose obsession with sports is ripping at the seams of our educational system and, consequently, our democracy.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   A democracy forming without the proper education is doomed to crumble. Education is the key in arming the electorate with the information necessary to consider candidates, yet superfluous spending toward athletics is hindering the way our society is learning and voting. Paving the path toward a strong democracy, not a sharply divided one, begins and ends with education. Shifting the focus from athletics to academics, from the playing field to the classroom, is the way to uphold our trembling nation. As Richard D. Kahlenberg and Clifford Janey explain, The Founders saw education as the safeguard of Americas system of self-governance. Educating common people was the answer to the oligarchs who said the average citizen could not be trusted to choose leaders wisely. But with more than two-thirds of Americans unable to name all three branches of government, I cant help but ponder: Is this the America that our founders had hoped for? Defunding sports is absurd. It is just as vital to have an active society as it is to have an educated one. But athletics cannot be the top priority when the U.S. is ranked so low in education. The Pew Research Center reports that the U.S. is currently 38th out of 71 developed and developing countries in math, and 24th in science. We are one of the wealthiest countries in the world, but our school funds are going down the wrong drain. Author Marguerite Roza found that one high school was spending $328 a student for math instruction and more than four times that much for cheerleading  $1,348 a cheerleader. Spend tax money wisely; invest more in education; prioritize academics over athletics. And, who knows? Maybe if we spent $60 million on libraries instead of sports stadiums, students would understand that their society values education. And they would vote accordingly. Works Cited Anderson, Lindsey.

The Case Against High-School Sports. The Atlantic. 19 Feb. 2014. _________ The Case for Teaching News Literacy Mary Hannah Grier, age 17 From start to finish, 2016 was a rude wake-up call to the state of news and information, and the influence that a few individuals can have over an entire countrys election. However, it also reaffirmed the power and relevancy that the written word still has in this day and age. A study conducted at Stanford University just after the November 2016 elections found that over 7,800 students in middle school, high school and college in 12 states were unable to assess the credibility of information that they encountered on the internet. Now, more than ever, it is critical that we teach students in all schools  public and private, K-12 and college  how to think critically and analyze the news that they come across. Though terms such as fake news have risen to prominence in the past year, the art of deception reaches back to the advent of modern media. Photography especially has long been used to make political statements, prove questionable supernatural sightings, and justify cultural appropriation. Today, complex 19th-century equipment and studios have been replaced with Photoshop and a computer. The outcome, however, is still the same: an altered form of truth, or proof of a nonexistent event. Photoshopped images cover the internet, often side-by-side with real ones. How are students with an untrained eye supposed to spot the difference between reality and fiction? Then there are the articles themselves. Fake news articles are mainly spread through various social media platforms, frequented by teenagers and adults alike. When people see fake news articles  which often have eye-catching or alarming headlines  how are they to judge the validity of these articles without knowing what to look for? Fact-checking sites like Snopes certainly help, but they do not cover every article or statement on the internet. Some claims can only be proven false through critical thinking and by consulting reputable references. There are many different ways to tackle the rise of fake news, but the most important is teaching people how to think critically about what they encounter on the news and how to recognize whether it is fact or fiction. This can only be accomplished by incorporating news literacy into existing school curriculums  such as government, civics or history classes  rather than having a separate elective or seminar. By the time students reach college, theyre already too immersed in their own worldviews to be able to look at news objectively. News literacy classes must be introduced to schools, and it needs to be done as soon as possible. Everyone is affected by fake news, and it is now our civic duty to educate ourselves and others about it. Works Cited Barron, James.

We all run back to class, forming a line and departing from our adventures in the land of recess. Im last in line. Every. Day. The system of alphabetical order in schools must be changed, as a silent bias toward the names starting with letters near the end of the alphabet is causing detrimental effects to our childrens psychology due to the subconscious implications of inferiority. As someone with the last name Zhang, I still remember the rush of excitement I felt when my teacher read the roll sheet from the bottom to the top  only on special occasions, of course. I remember the condolences the teacher would give, telling me last but not least! But I still felt least. This display of alphabetical inequality not only continually provides an unfair disadvantage and feeling of inferiority to the same group of people; it also affects our decisions made later in life. In the New York Times article How Inequality Hollows Out the Soul by Richard Wilkinson and Kate Pickett, it discusses how social inequality allows us to not only [see] what we knew intuitively  that inequality is divisive and socially corrosive  but that it also damages the individual psyche. If inequality in wealth damages people, why wouldnt inequality in school cause damage as well? In a recent four-series scientific study in the Journal of Consumer Research conducted by Kurt A. Carlson, assistant professor at Georgetown, and Jacqueline M. Conard, assistant professor at Belmont University, the professors found that those who had last names later in the alphabet reacted quicker to special sale opportunities when offered deals simultaneously. We find that the later in the alphabet the first letter of ones childhood surname is, the faster the person acquires items as an adult. We dub this the last name effect ... it stems from childhood ordering structures that put children with different names in different positions in lines ... since those late in the alphabet are typically at the end of lines, they compensate by responding quickly to acquisition opportunities, Professor Carlson says. Alphabetical order is fine for files in cabinets or books in a library or for naming hurricanes. It is not appropriate for organizing people. There may be no great alternatives to alphabetical order, says Professor Carlson. But flip it around every now and then. Thats a reasonable way to balance things out. Works Cited Gregory, Sean.

Yet, the opposite has occurred. According to the Federal Bureau of Prisons, 46.3 percent of inmates are currently imprisoned on drug offenses. The National Institute on Drug Abuse approximates that more than 50,000 individuals died from drug overdoses in 2015 alone, and states that diseases like hepatitis and H.I.V. continue to rage, spreading through unhygienic methods like unsterilized needles. Considering these failed results, the federal government should look to an alternative approach to combating drug use. That alternative is the decriminalization and legalization of all illicit drugs. This may seem like a disastrous choice; however, in Portugal, its worked. In 2001, Portugals government decriminalized and legalized all drugs, no matter their severity, in response to a growing heroin problem. Instead of a criminal offense, those caught with less than a 10-day supply of hard drugs are taken before a special court of legal experts, psychologists and social workers. In place of jail time, a small fine or community service, as well as treatment, is provided. Today, Portugal has one of the lowest drug-usage rates in all of Europe. The British Journal of Criminology found a significant reduction in the imprisonment of alleged drug dealers, from 14,000 in 2000 to 5,000 in 2010, and in the imprisonment of addicts, which fell from 41 percent in 1999 to 21 percent in 2008. The Washington Post reported that there are three drug overdose deaths for every 1,000,000 citizens in Portugal; as a comparison, 44.6 per million die in the United Kingdom. Drug-related diseases, like H.I.V., have decreased, while the dramatic rise in use feared by some has failed to materialize, as stated by the Transform Drug Policy Institute. By focusing on treatment rather than punishment, Portugal has given its citizens the opportunity to rehabilitate and contribute as functioning members of society. Consequently, the demand for drugs falls as the number of users declines. In the U.S., certain states are moving toward reformation instead of incarceration. The New York Times reported Mayor Bill de Blasios efforts to combat the wild opioid epidemic in New York City: $38 million a year will go to programs like expanded methadone and buprenorphine treatment for addicts and a focus at city hospitals on dealing with addiction and overdoses.

Its time to look for an alternative model; Portugal has proved that its model works. Works Cited A Brief History of the Drug War. Drug Policy Alliance.

Members of minority groups struggle to find accurate representation in films, clinging tightly to even the smallest examples of representation. This lack of diversity is particularly damaging to young children, whose perception of the world is warped to fit a narrative where only a certain type of person gets to have a happily ever after. In 2015, only 22 out of 126 released films featured a character that was part of the L.G.B.T.Q.+ community. Some people argue that because there are more cis-heterosexuals in real life, there should be more cis-heterosexuals in films. By this logic, the number of cis-heterosexual characters in individual films should exceed L.G.B.T.Q. characters. The lack of L.G.B.T.Q.+ characters in over 100 films creates entire universes where L.G.B.T.Q.+ people are seemingly nonexistent, a statistic that does not mirror reality in the slightest. Children especially need to see L.G.B.T.Q.+ characters, and yet their demographic is the one that is most denied access to films with accurate representation. Unfortunately, many people consider same-sex relationships to be too mature for children. Because of this, impressionable young people are prevented from watching films that could help them to better understand themselves and to accept the people around them. This also prevents L.G.B.T.Q.+ people and relationships from becoming normalized. If children are not exposed to the L.G.B.T.Q.+ community until later on in life, they will learn to treat it as something new and different as adults. By showing them films with diverse casts of characters, children will recognize that L.G.B.T.Q.+ people are a part of everyday life and that they have a right to ... their happily ever after, too. Normalizing L.G.B.T.Q.+ identities will also normalize their inclusion in films and other media outlets, because the people making those films will be so used to a world of L.G.B.T.Q.+ people that to not include them would be unthinkable. Film companies argue that parents would not allow their children to see films with L.G.B.T.Q.+ characters in them, making diversity and inclusivity bad for business. Though there are certainly people who would boycott films on this basis, there are also many parents who would be thrilled to see their children introduced to that kind of diversity at such a young age. Many L.G.B.T.Q.+ adults would watch the films as well, because they want to experience the representation they were denied as a child. Representation in any type of media is important, but L.G.B.T.Q.+ visibility in childrens films is of particular significance. It represents another step on the long road to equality and a shift in the mind-set of an entire generation. Works Cited Bahr, Lindsey.  Are Gay Moments in Beauty and Power Rangers Progress?

And Im sure by now many high schoolers know that the mitochondria is the powerhouse of a cell. Having knowledge in a variety of subjects gives students information that could be useful in their futures depending on what they do with their lives. But what about classes that teach skills that will be useful to everyone, regardless of their life paths? Being a high school student myself, I do not believe I currently know enough about how to manage money. If more personal finance classes were available in schools, students would be more prepared for their futures. Financial education is not a requirement in every U.S. state, and students are missing out on useful information because of this. Only 17 states require high school students to take a course in personal finance ... the same number as in 2014. The United States is also behind other countries in regard to financial education. A 2012 international survey reported, more than 1 in 6 students in the United States failed to reach the baseline level of proficiency in financial literacy. This same large study showed that American students are just behind Latvia and just ahead of Russia in financial knowledge, at the center of the countries assessed. Using money is something people do in their everyday lives, so being in the dark about financial skills leaves room for instability. When high school students take finance classes, they are more responsible with their finances. It has been shown that high school students who are required to take personal finance courses have better average credit scores and lower debt delinquency rates as young adults. In the New York Times article, Making Your Family Better at Personal Finance, Paul Brown says after his daughter took a personal finance course, she was far better with money than her equally smart brothers. A parents advice alone is often not enough to foster sensible financial habits in young people  being in a classroom allows students to process information and make meaningful connections to their own lives. While my school district requires I take a personal finance class in high school, many schools throughout the world do not. Young students everywhere should have ways to learn about how to survive and succeed in their lives, and learning about the economy is one way to do that. Yes, learning about the cycle of how rocks melt into magma can be interesting, but learning how to create and manage a budget, use and manage a credit card, and pay off a mortgage can make a lasting positive influence on ones life.

Credit Isak Tiner for The New York Times        Hilary Duff may have come up as a bubbly Disney star, but these days she plays a complex, career-focused editor on TV Lands comedy Younger, back this month for Season 4. When she is not on set in New York, Ms. Duff, 29, who lives in Los Angeles and is the mother to a 5-year-old son, Luca Cruz Comrie, might be trying out yoga classes and dabbling in makeup. Peruse her favorites, below. Skin Care I exfoliate with Dr. Lancers Polish . You do it dry, so its kind of abrasive, but I find it really makes a difference if you do it every day. Harold Lancer has been my dermatologist for probably six years. He does the best microdermabrasion. My favorite serum is by 3Lab . Its super-expensive, but I dont use it all the time. Then I use La Mer cream. I want a thick layer on my face. And I use this Tata Harper eye cream  the Restorative one. Right now, Im using a Glossier gel kind of sunscreen. And I do masks all the time. I did the GlamGlow SuperMud one last week. I also like the 24K Gold one by Peter Thomas Roth . And then theres m -61 ; I love the resurfacing pads. I also use eyelash and eyebrow serums. I like Dr. Lancers lash serum best. Then I use this brow serum I get from Amazon called Neubrow . It helps because I dont have a lot of brow hair, and Im always penciling in. Actually, I go to the Streicher S isters , and one of them, Kristie, does brows. Shes getting her license in microblading, but she wont do anyone yet. Shes like, I still dont like the way it looks totally. And I keep saying: Ill be on your guinea pig! Do it now! Ill go cheating on you if you dont!

Slide Show    Makeup I like Laura Mercier tinted moisturizer . And I like a lot of Kevyn Aucoin products, especially for contour and highlighting. I like to have a bit of a shaded face  thats my go-to look. I carve a little cheekbone with a contour. Then I usually dust a light bronzer everywhere and do a little contour around my eyes and down my nose. I pencil in my brows, curl my lashes and Im done. (Im big on curling my eyelashes.) I use a Smashbox mascara called Full Exposure . It doesnt drop, and it has a fatter brush that I like.  Continue reading the main story         Advertisement   Continue reading the main story       I also love anything shimmery. Recently I got all these glitter eyeliners from Urban Decay . Its chunky glitter. I went over to my friends house, and she said to me, Im digging your eighth-grade liner, girl. I really love the Chanel Vitalumiere Aqua foundation for a nighttime dinner or something. And if Im doing a lip, Im really into all of the Tom Ford matte colors . Theyre all named after boys, which is really funny. I like Bradley, I like Evan, and this one I have on is Cristiano. My favorite lip balm is a cocoa butter stick from the drugstore, the fat one that looks like a glue stick. Also, theres this line Im obsessed with at Sephora called Bum Bum Cream . It smells so good! And now they have a lip balm, and I cant stop. My son smelled it the other day, and he goes, Mom that smells like Hawaii. I was like, I know, lets go! Hair Remember the days when people were offended if you asked if they colored their hair? Even though it was in stripes? The salon I go to is Nine Zero One in L.A. Nikki and Riawna, they do my color and cut. Cynthia Vanis, who does my hair for the show, also cuts it. Two seasons ago, I was so tired of having long extensions. The day we wrapped, we headed to the trailer and she cut my hair to my chin. It was so fun. Right now Im using a R&Co color shampoo and conditioner. I also use this purple conditioner for blondes called Fabuloso by Evo  it comes in a big funny tube. Thats like a once-a-week thing. I recently did a campaign for Joico for a new shampoo and conditioner for blondes that I love. The shampoo does a creamy thing instead of a lather thing.

Its very floral, but its also lemony and citrusy. Other Services I just got nail extensions because I was feeling a little wild. I basically went with fake lash extensions and fake nails in one weekend. I had to do something because my son was away for the weekend. Diet and Fitness The skinny now is so unattainable. There are so many delicious foods in New York. Do people just deprive themselves? I struggle with it just like everybody else. Sometimes Im really on track and not eating sugar or gluten, and Ill feel really good. Then there are times  like this past weekend at a kids birthday  when I see a cupcake and eat it. I wont beat myself up over it. I hike a lot in L.A., and I do this class called Training Mate . Its a little like Barrys Bootcamp but without the treadmill. I do another running class in L.A. with my mom friends. We drop off the kids at school and then go to Pulse . In New York, I live above a SoulCycle, so Ive been spinning a lot. Or Ill go running up and down the West Side Highway. I havent found a yoga class in New York that I like. Some classes here will walk you through the flow twice and then abandon you to do it on our own. After Ive worked all day, the last thing I want is to have to remember the flow. I would like to find a class, but I want someone to hold my hand through the whole process.

From left, makeup looks from Erin Fetherston, Adam Selman and Jason Wus fall 2017 collections.   Credit Imaxtree.com        The powdered, matte face has long been out of favor. But its replacement, the look of the moment, is a moving target. It wasnt long ago that contouring was a YouTube obsession, followed soon after by strobing and assorted batty offshoots. Whatever the technique, though, the focus was always on using light (or its absence) to enhance ones features. During the fall 2017 fashion shows that just ended, some makeup artists did just that in the prettiest way possible, using a combination of blush and highlighter. The collections were autumnal, but the models were aglow with springlike dewy skin. By adding both highlight and blush, it gives a liveliness to the skin, which is very beautiful all year round, said Kelli Bartlett, the vice president for makeup and new services at the beauty-services booking app Glamsquad . She created an understated glow at the Erin Fetherston show at New York Fashion Week . That freshness is the looks key. And getting it is easy. Swap out powdered versions of blush and highlighter for cream and liquid formulas.     How to Get Dewy Spring Skin  The best blushes, highlighters and extras that deliver just the right radiance.             There are two types of glow that can be achieved on the skin, said Troy Surratt, the makeup artist and founder of Surratt Beauty . Light-reflective uses shimmer, and humectant adds glow with dewy moisture. And sometimes a product is a combination of both.

The look is also noticeably without contour.  Continue reading the main story         Advertisement   Continue reading the main story       Contour intimidates some women, Ms. Bartlett said. They can end up with stripes on the face. You have to be an expert blender. So this idea that you can non-tour is great. You can change the face structure with just highlighter and blush. People tend to think of highlighters as universal shades. Not so, according to Sir John, the makeup artist and LOreal Paris brand ambassador. He suggests cool-toned colors like silver or frosty pinks for fair skin. Olive and medium skin tones are best lit with gold. And for dark skin, try rose gold or copper.

For deep skin tones, Ms. Bartlett advised opting for vibrant colors. Otherwise you risk them not showing up or looking muddy, she said. Bright oranges and reds add warmth to the skin. Deep plums and raisin tones add depth. Before applying blush or highlighter, make sure skin is moisturized or primed. Cream products can drag on the skin and deposit supersaturated color thats more difficult to blend out, Mr. Surratt said. Apply blush first, starting on the apples of the cheeks, then sweeping up toward the temple. This will frame the face and create structure without contouring. With the index finger, tap cream or liquid highlighter along the bridge of the nose, on top of cheekbones, in the middle of the eyelid, at the inner corners of the eye and the cupids bow. Buff the highlighter with a small fluffy brush. The results will be beautiful  but dont overdo it. Highlighter isnt meant for the center of the face toward the nose. Youll end up looking greasy, Sir John said.   Continue following our fashion and lifestyle coverage on Facebook ( Styles and Modern Love ), Twitter ( Styles , Fashion and Weddings ) and Instagram .

One client said: My husband still doesnt know exactly what I had done. When he came home, he asked if I got Botox.   Credit Emily Berl for The New York Times     Despite the loud Instagram makeup trends that continue to rage, a lot of women are feeling a disconnect. They simply want to make it out the door feeling as if they are relatively put together. Because, lets be honest, who has the time? Im not someone who loves to be glammed up, said Simone Dufourg, who for years helped run the Prive salon in Manhattan. (Her father-in-law is the Prive owner, Laurent Dufourg.) She describes her aesthetic as very natural, but after becoming a mother and getting older, she realized that natural beauty actually took a lot of work. A couple of months ago, Ms. Dufourg made an appointment with Dominique Bossavy , known for her skill in semipermanent makeup. She had heard about her through friends in Beverly Hills, Calif., where Ms. Bossavy has her main office. (Many, many women I knew were doing it, but they were not telling, Ms. Dufourg said.) But she went through with it after reading on Vogue.com about Lena Dunhams visit there to have her brows done.  Photo        Ms. Bossavy demonstrating an eyebrow treatment.   Credit Emily Berl for The New York Times    Ms. Dufourg had work done on her brows (filled for shape and color), lips (defined with a natural shade of pink) and stretch marks on her breasts (filled in with ink that matched her skin tone).

Its so subtle  it enhances my look without adding a lot of extra. My husband still doesnt know exactly what I had done. When he came home, he asked if I got Botox .  Continue reading the main story         Advertisement   Continue reading the main story       (Ms. Bossavy, whose prices start at $1,500, sees clients in New York twice a month at Dangene: the Institute of Skinovation ). As it turns out, Ms. Dufourg is participating in an Instagram trend after all. Spurred by hashtags, inked brows, particularly those created from microblading, have become hip. And if the thought of tattooed eyebrows conjures images of the ill-done sea gull wings of the 1990s (they faded to a Hunger Games blue), know that needles are finer now and inks more nuanced, to complement skin tone.  Photo        Ms. Bossavy, in her studio, demonstrating a NanoColor Infusion eyebrow treatment.   Credit Emily Berl for The New York Times    There is some confusion as to what exactly microblading is. Ms. Bossavy, who has been plying her art since 2001, insisted she did not practice microblading. She sketches the desired shape with a makeup pencil, hand-mixes custom color for each client, then uses a single, very fine needle to create shape or fill in the brows with small amounts of pigment. In microblading, the technician uses a pen that has nearly a dozen tiny needles in a row to form a blade, the idea being that the blade can replicate the actual brow hair. Ms. Bossavy considers the method less precise and makes fixing mistakes more difficult. Youre cutting the skin more with microblading, she said. The more you injure the skin, the higher the chance you have of scarring. Piret Aava, who calls herself the Eyebrow Doctor , begs to differ. Originally a makeup artist, Ms. Aava learned microblading for clients who had lost their brow hair. She then built her business through Instagram , eventually opening her own office in Manhattan, where she has worked on such celebrities as Serena Williams and Malin Akerman. Ms. Aava said a single-needle method could create powder brows that looked as though the arches were filled in with brow powder.  Photo        A variety of custom pigments Ms. Bossavy uses.   Credit Emily Berl for The New York Times    Im not going for a makeup look, she said. You can always add makeup if you want. (Her work also starts at $1,500. Recovery takes about a week, she said, possibly with very light scabbing, and results last about a year.)   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   Cosmetic tattooing is not the only semipermanent makeup with newfound popularity. To streamline her everyday routine, Clemence von Mueffling, founder of the site Beauty and Well Being , has her lashes tinted and permed at least twice a year. Ms. von Mueffling lives in New York but grew up in Paris, where her mother and grandmother were beauty directors for Vogue France. Every neighborhood in Paris has these small beauty institutes, in the way that New York has nail salons, she said. I started eyelash tinting at one of them probably when I was 19. In the summer, she swipes on Comodynes self-tanner, and is out the door. These are little tricks to make you feel good and look good, she added. In Brooklyn, the Gimme the Good Stuff blogger Maia James, who indulges in lash extensions despite a minimal beauty routine, noted that for many in her social circle, the switch to semipermanent solutions came with having children: The look at school pickup is all about Lululemon, no makeup and yet fake lashes  literally, every single mom.

All the lash extensions out there, its not just about looking natural, said Soo-Young Kim, a fashion and beauty editor. Its because they look amazing in photos and really make your eyes pop. Ms. Kim pointed out that many of the semipermanent beauty options today derive from South Korea, where her cousins have indulged for decades. Soul Lee was one of the early practitioners of eyelash extensions in New York, opening the Shu Uemura shop in SoHo in 2004. Initially, she said, clients came for extensions for weddings or special events. Only lately have women begun to make them a regular routine. Her own applications tend toward the natural and believable, and she avoids styles like the currently popular Russian technique, or volume lashes, which involves gluing three or four extensions for each natural lash. (It can put a lot of stress on your natural lashes, especially if they are thin to start with, Ms. Lee said.) People ask for the Kim Kardashian look, and I dont even have the size of lashes to make that happen, she said. I want the results to look like youre wearing mascara, instead of your eyelashes touching your eyebrows.

Related Article   Credit Alec Soth/Magnum, for The New York Times     Update | Read the work of this years 10 winners here and this years runners-up here . _________ For the past four years weve invited students to write short editorials about issues they care about, and each year thousands take up the challenge. Students often start with thoughtful questions from their own lives: Why is my schools athletic program better funded than its music program? Why do we hide in the corner of our classroom during active shooter drills? Why dont my classmates stand during the Pledge of Allegiance? And they develop sophisticated, sincere and well researched answers in response. Students look at the nations and worlds problems and hunt for solutions  to improve the plight of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people in China, for example, or to reduce recidivism rates for U.S. prisons. We really like this contest because it asks students to look closely at their world and find something, large or small, they want to change. So, if you dont like being last in line all the time because your surname starts with Z, then take a stand. If you want more characters in books and movies to be more like you, then write about it. If you want society to be less wasteful or more tolerant, then tell the world. Change starts with noticing, thinking critically, and starting meaningful conversations  and thats what these students have done in their editorials.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   But winning this contest? Its no easy task being selected as a winner out of 7,895 entries, a record. How do you make your writing stand out from the piles of other editorials submitted to our contest  especially when you have no more than 450 words to get your point across?

Grab our attention in the first few sentences, but dont take too long to state your argument. Heres another: Pick a fresh topic, or a new angle on a popular topic, and be very clear about what you are arguing. Often when students narrow in on a specific concern, their editorial becomes more persuasive. What else? Write with an original, confident voice and avoid formulaic language and structure. And if appropriate, acknowledge, and deftly dispatch, counterarguments. Below, we list 10 winners, 15 runners-up and 45 honorable mentions. We also include a PDF of all the finalists , including 58 who made the cut to the third round of judging, but didnt quite reach the winners circle. Starting May 22, we will be publishing one of the Top 10 essays each weekday in posts that we hope you will spread on social media, hang on school bulletin boards and perhaps even use as mentor texts for next years contest.

Credit Emily Berl for The New York Times        Laura Dern has been acting since she was a tween girl, and, at 50, she is as in demand as ever. This year she has a remarkably full slate, including roles as a high-powered working mother in Big Little Lies (currently airing on HBO) and as Woody Harrelsons ex-wife in the film Wilson (to hit theaters on March 24). Later this year, she will appear in the David Lynch reboot of Twin Peaks (out in May) and in  Star Wars: Episode VIII  The Last Jedi (planned for December). When she is not onscreen, Ms. Dern is often shuttling her two children around town. Find out the skin care and makeup favorites that keep her feeling pulled together through it all. Skin Care I have a few beloved staples. Ive been going to the Face Place for facials for many years, so at home Ill wash and sometimes moisturize with their products. Recently Ive also discovered Kate Somerville DermalQuench spray. Its oxygen you spray on your face, and it hydrates. I take it on planes. Im not as diligent as I should be about sunscreen, but if Im really going to be in the sun, I use an SPF by Dermalogica . My body lotion is Eminence . They use a lot of bamboo or coconut oil derivatives. The one thing that is with me at all times, in my purse, in the car, is my La Mer lip balm . I love it so much that when my 11-year-old daughter was figuring out what to give me for Christmas, she ended up getting it for my stocking. At night, I might use this really beautiful camellia oil by Julie Hewett , the makeup artist. Or Ill use i S Clinica l  they have a lot of cool oils and serums that Im just learning about. Makeup Being an actress my whole life, it feels so good to have a clean face when Im off, so Im not a big makeup wearer. The two things I always put on are my La Mer lip balm and the LOreal mascara Ive been using forever  the Voluminous one in waterproof black. If I need something more, I use La Prairie cream blush . Its super-natural and also looks great on film when you want to look like you dont have any makeup on but you need some color.

If its work, the makeup artists tend to use Cle de Peau . But on my own time, Ive started using Burberry Fresh Glow BB cream . Im raising two children; I need beauty products with luminescent qualities. Last night I had press until midnight and was at a meeting at 5:15 this morning. I put the cream on with some face oil  Neals Yard has this lovely rosehip oil  and everyone says, Oh, youre so glow-y!

Continue reading the main story         Advertisement   Continue reading the main story       Hair Im a natural blonde. I was a towhead as a kid, and then it got ashier when I was 18. But for film, Ive been colored auburn, strawberry blond and sometimes a little more honey-colored. When I filmed Wilson, we really wanted the character to be trashed, and to look like shes been through a lot. For hair, I had really dark roots, and my colorist of the last 20 years, Johnathan Gale , made it look really fried and bleached at the ends. Now there are these beautiful masks that save me. I like Kerastase . For my cuts, I go to my beloved friend, the brilliant 6-foot-1 Icelandic creature Frida Aradottir, whos one of the most brilliant hair designers. We met on Wild at Heart. When shes not busy  she was Emma Stones hair stylist on La La Land  shell very kindly bring her scissors over.

Right this second Im wearing Jo Malone Dark Amber & Ginger Lily dry body oil . Jo Malone has a really nice vetiver, too. And then I love Annick Goutal Eau dHadrien , and Bottega Veneta has a new one, Eau Sensuelle , that is super-pretty. Then I have this amazing thing: Theres a small group of doctors and scientists who started this line called Happiness Abscissa . They make scents that chemically change your mood  a scent as an antidepressant. I do have to say, sometimes I spray this on, and I absolutely feel good. Diet and Fitness Diet is weird. Its elusive. I just try to listen to my body. Lately, Ive been doing matcha green tea with my whisk, and I really love it. I put manuka honey in it. My children are like: Mom! That honey is odd . But then when they dont feel well, I make them hot water with fresh ginger, manuka honey and a dash of cayenne. Drink that tea, and life is good. The kids are actually very healthy. My son is an impassioned surfer and into healthy foods and juices. We dont have a lot of gluten and dairy in the house. The fitness part, its literally whatever I can get whenever I can get it. Before kids, it used to be an hour and a half of yoga in the morning. Now I try to fit in some exercise on a dog walk. As a working parent, youre just constantly trying to fit it all in.
