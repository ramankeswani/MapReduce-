Inspired perhaps by the Womens March on Washington last month (not to mention the feminist groundswell seemingly building ever since), the more influential beauty looks at New York Fashion Week had a message: Theres a new power woman in town, and shes not afraid to manhandle beauty stereotypes to her liking. At Alexander Wangs fall 2017 show, the angular black clothes were punctuated almost harshly by black eyeliner. The makeup artist Diane Kendal, using Nars cosmetics, created the look with multiple eyeliner types (pencil and liquid, and in different finishes). Colorful, smoky eyes have been hip lately (think: amethyst, emerald and shimmery browns), so the black eye makeup really sent a message, Ms. Kendal said. The goal was to look strong and powerful, and that the models look very sure of themselves. Likewise, according to the collection notes at Jonathan Simkhai, the designer wanted to show women as a powerful force to be reckoned with. (If the clothes didnt broadcast that message, then the front row certainly did. Mr. Simkhai had placed Feminist AF tees on the benches and, for every seat at the show, donated $5 to Planned Parenthood.) The makeup artist Yadim, mixing a couple shades of Maybelline New York Color Sensational Lipstick, translated the designers idea into rich red lips, which he said, signify the power of a woman over a man. Red, red lips and strong eye makeup, despite clever tweaks on those classics, may have felt like a 1980s redux had it not been for the accompanying hair. Forget the usual power hairstyles  the helmet bobs, the impressive volume. Yadims crimson pout felt fresh when paired with an unfussy ponytail. Gently pulled together, left wavy and held low by a black elastic, the ponytail seemed to be lifted directly from the busy working womans playbook. (A similar hairstyle was spotted at Jason Wu.)

On the sexy Australian model Catherine McNeil, who had hair below her shoulders, the piece-y Garcon chop was so unexpected it was electrifying.

Credit Dolly Faibyshev for The New York Times    I present the idea of the cut, but the models dont have to do it, Mr. Palau said. Cat McNeil now owns the look for the moment, and its powerful because she made that decision. With hair, he pointed out, radical changes send a bold message because you cant just wash it off. If its a drastic cut or color, it takes courage, he said. Yes, I know Cat is a model, but not every model would do that. And when she wakes up the next morning, she lives with the decision she made.

He also mined texture for the Calvin Klein show, where he highlighted each models unique hair quality by spritzing Redken Wind Blown 05 texturizing spray through clean strands.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   Right now is one of the most inclusive moments Ive seen in fashion, said Mr. Palau, who has worked in the industry for decades. We have different textures. We have different styles. We have different types of beauty. And the looks we are seeing are achievable. Its a very powerful message that we are celebrating womens individuality. Heres a thought: Perhaps the typical power woman beauty looks can be dispensed with all together. At Cushnie et Ochs, where the designers showed pants, jumpsuits and pantsuits (and Madame Gandhis  Future Is Female blared over the speakers), the makeup artist Gato, using Maybelline New York, created full brows, subtly contoured cheekbones, defined lashes and pink-nude matte lips (Maybelline New York Color Sensational Inti-Matte Nudes in Almond Rose). It was the kind of makeup you would be likely to see in real life boardrooms. This is a woman, not a girl, Gato said. And when I think about a power woman, she doesnt need to overdo her makeup. She knows exactly what to wear. She doesnt need to overdo anything.

Credit Yana Paskova for The New York Times     Do you like to stay up on whats going on in politics and the government? How much are you following the news lately? When politics stories appear on social media, do you click on them? Have you noticed an increase in civics-related conversations recently among your friends, family members or teachers? How much is civics on your radar? Discuss the importance and priority of civics in your personal life and school. In  The Snapchat Cohort Gets Into Politics, and Civics Is Cool , Elizabeth Harris writes: In Bridgette Francis Advanced Placement comparative government class at the College of Staten Island High School for International Studies, there was palpable excitement over a recent project  on the North American Free Trade Agreement.  In the hallways of Middle School 447 in Brooklyn, talk of gay rights and President Trumps executive order on immigration has replaced chatter about the Kardashians or Beyonce, or somebodys new sneakers, said Leslie Hughes, a seventh-grade English teacher.  And at Riverside High School in Greer, S.C., theyre talking about Jeff Sessions and theyre talking about Betsy DeVos, said Lindsey Beam, a science teacher and adviser to the youths in the government club.  These are signs of unusual times.  With Mr. Trump in the White House, the obsession with politics that has many adult Americans fiercely focused on the Senates latest confirmation hearing and the presidents last Twitter message has filtered down to those not yet of voting age. High school and even middle school students are showing a level of civic engagement not seen in years, their teachers and principals say. Students: Read the entire article, then tell us:  Are you seeing an increase in class discussions about government, civics and politics? If so, how do you feel about them? Do you feel you know enough about these topics to participate, if a conversation occurs in class? Why or why not?  Do you find yourself talking about politics with your friends and family more often than you used to? What kinds of conversations are you having?

And theyre seeking direction on how we get back to that point. Why or why not?

Credit Gene J. Puskar/Associated Press     Have you ever boycotted an item or brand because of the actions, beliefs or statements of the company or the person who sells it? Do social, environmental or political concerns factor into your decisions about what you buy or dont buy? Why or why not? In  Shopping Becomes a Political Act in the Trump Era , Julie Creswell and Rachel Abrams write: A couple of weeks ago, people boycotted Nordstrom for one reason: The department store sold Ivanka Trump products.  Now people are boycotting Nordstrom for another reason: The store said it would not sell her products.  These days, a shirt is not always just a shirt, and a store is not always just a store. Handbags, dresses and other ordinary items  and where they are bought  have become politicized, turning shopping decisions into acts of protest for the millions of people in pro- and anti-President Trump camps. Under Armour, L.L. Bean, T.J. Maxx and many other companies have already been pulled into a sort of ideological tug of war. Students: Read the entire article, then tell us:  What did you think about while you were reading the article? At what points did you identify, or not, with the details? Why?
