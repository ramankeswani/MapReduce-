He sold it to Uber for $680 million six months later.   Credit Ramin Rahimian for The New York Times     SAN FRANCISCO  Waymo, the self-driving car business spun out of Googles parent company last year, asked a federal court on Friday to block Ubers work on a competing self-driving vehicle that Waymo claimed could be using stolen technology. Waymo also filed testimony from employees and a Google security engineer describing how Anthony Levandowski , a former Google executive, discussed Ubers interest in the technology and systematically stole proprietary company documents. In February 2016, Mr. Levandowski left to start his own self-driving truck company, Otto. He sold it to Uber for $680 million six months later. Waymo sued Uber last month, accusing the ride-hailing company of colluding with Mr. Levandowski to steal crucial parts of Waymos technology to accelerate its development of autonomous vehicles. Gary Brown, Googles security engineer specializing in forensics, said in a partially redacted declaration that Mr. Levandowski searched Googles network in December 2015 for login details to a document repository for Chauffeur, the internal code name for the driverless car project.

A few days later, Mr. Levandowski attached a memory card to his laptop for eight hours, Mr. Brown said.  Continue reading the main story         Advertisement   Continue reading the main story       Mr. Levandowski, along with former Google employees Sameer Kshirsagar and Radu Raduta, gained access to a Google Drive folder containing company files and exported documents about suppliers to a personal device, according to the declaration. Soon after, they left the company for Otto, Mr. Brown said in his testimony. Waymo asked the federal court here for a preliminary injunction against Otto and Uber. A hearing for the injunction motion is scheduled for April 27. Waymo said in its initial lawsuit that it was inadvertently copied on an email from a supplier with blueprints of Ubers circuit board design for its lidar technology, or light detection and ranging sensors, used in self-driving cars. Waymo said Ubers designs bore a striking resemblance to its secret designs. In another partially redacted declaration filed with the court, Pierre-Yves Droz, a hardware engineer at Waymo, said Mr. Levandowski, while still with Google, told him that he wanted long-range lidar for his start-up and that he wanted to replicate Waymos technology. Mr. Droz said this did not surprise him because Mr. Levandowski had told him earlier that he wanted to start a self-driving car company and that Uber would be interested in buying the team responsible for the lidar being developed at Google. Mr. Droz also said Mr. Levandowski, after being spotted at Uber headquarters while still working at Google, admitted to him that he had met with the ride-hailing service because he was looking for investors for his new company. Mr. Droz joined Google when it acquired 510 Systems in 2011, a self-driving car start-up he founded with Mr. Levandowski.

Traditional automakers and technology companies see major opportunities in sensor technology and artificial intelligence to replace traditional automobiles with autonomous vehicles. New start-ups are popping up regularly as both car companies and established tech firms are plowing money into acquiring talent and technology. Proponents of driverless cars say that autonomous vehicles will reduce the number of automobile fatalities and injuries, as well as free people to be more productive.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   Mr. Levandowski, Mr. Kshirsagar and Mr. Raduta could not be reached for comment. Competition should be fueled by innovation in the labs and on the roads, not through unlawful actions, said Johnny Luu, a Waymo spokesman. Given the strong evidence we have, we are asking the court step in to protect intellectual property developed by our engineers over thousands of hours and to prevent any use of that stolen IP. Uber has called the Waymo lawsuit a baseless attempt to slow down a competitor. An Uber spokeswoman declined to comment on the injunction request. Once allies, Alphabet  the parent company of Waymos and Google  and Uber are now fierce competitors. Alphabet was one of Ubers early investors, with an $250 million investment in 2013. And Uber used to rely on Googles mapping technology before deciding to develop its own maps. As it became increasingly apparent that the two companies were headed for a showdown, David Drummond, a longtime Alphabet executive, stepped down from Ubers board of directors . As an independent company, Waymo is under greater pressure to generate revenue. It could enter the ride-hailing business with its autonomous vehicles. Travis Kalanick, Ubers chief executive, has said that autonomous vehicles are central to the companys future. Replacing human drivers with robot cars theoretically would allow Uber to lower costs over time and offer safer rides around the clock. Google started working on driverless cars eight years ago, long before most companies thought the concept could be commercially viable. While the technology has improved dramatically, Waymo has yet to articulate a business strategy for how it intends to make money from autonomous vehicles.

Credit Melissa Phillip/Houston Chronicle By  David Leonhardt March 7, 2017 The federal judge and legal scholar Guido Calabresi likes to pose a conundrum to his law students. He asks them to imagine a deity coming forth to offer society a wondrous invention, one that would make everyday life more pleasant in almost every way. This invention comes with a cost, however. In exchange, the deity would choose 1,000 young men and women and strike them dead. Calabresi then asks the students if they accept the deal. In 30 years of giving the lecture at Yale, the answer is almost always no. At which point he delivers the lesson: Whats the difference between this and the automobile? Modern society is impossible to imagine without the automobile, yet its also one of the biggest destroyers of life. In the United States, crashes claim 1,000 lives every nine days. Last year, 40,000 Americans died, about as many as from breast cancer and more than twice as many as from murder . We put up with these costs because we imagine them as unavoidable human imperfection. We are willing to make some changes, like wearing seatbelts and driving sober, which have caused deaths to decline gradually for decades. But we assume there is no cure. Weve accepted the deitys offer: modernity in exchange for 1,000 lives, again and again and again. The digital revolution, however, is changing the calculation. It is both making the problem worse and creating a potential solution. First the bad news: Vehicle deaths are surging, up 14 percent in the last two years. Its the first significant rise in a half century, which qualifies as a public-health emergency. The recent increase, by itself, exceeds the entire annual toll from skin cancer. The only plausible cause is the texting, calling, watching and posting that people now do while operating a large piece of machinery. Insurers understand that, as The Wall Street Journal reported , and are raising rates. The stories of individual deaths  and I read many while reporting this column  are awful. They make you think of your family, your friends and, guiltily, your own distracted driving. Image Joseph Tikalsky was killed by a distracted driver as he crossed a country road to get his newspaper. Credit Jeff Thompson/Star Tribune Five-year-old Moriah Modisette was in her parents Toyota Camry near Dallas when a man driving an S.U.V., and using his iPhone, slammed into the Modisettes, killing Moriah. Megan Goeltz, a pregnant mother of a 3-year-old girl, was in her Ford Fusion at a stop sign in Minnesota when a distracted drivers car flew over an embankment and crushed her. Joseph Tikalsky was getting the newspaper out of his mailbox one morning. Ten-year-old Raquel Rosete was walking on the sidewalk. Brittanie Johnson, Brianna Robinson and her sister Jade Robinson, none of whom was yet 20, were passengers returning home from a vacation. Every one of them was killed by a distracted driver. Unfortunately, stories like these wont persuade most people to give up distracted driving. We are overconfident about our own driving abilities. ( Im just going to glance at my phone on this straightaway. ) And smartphones, with their alerts, are so darn enticing. This is a really difficult traffic safety problem, unlike any other one, says David Teater, a Michigan business executive who became an anti-distraction advocate after his 12-year-old son, Joseph , was killed. Drunken driving and seatbelt-less riding dont tempt drivers at almost every moment. Phones do. Like most public-health crises, this one requires a societal solution. Today, not a single state has a sensible law. Most forbid holding a phone while driving, but penalties and enforcement are weak  and hands-free use is still dangerous, studies show. The distraction, not the physical act of holding a phone, creates the problem. Think of it this way: Allowing hands-free talking and texting is akin to forbidding drivers from getting drunk on liquor yet letting them have a few beers before getting behind the wheel. Some companies, including Exxon Mobil and Johnson & Johnson, have a better approach. They have banned employees from all smartphone use while driving. The other answer is technology. There is strong, robust technology available that could solve a lot of the distracted-driving problem immediately , Teater points out. Apple and wireless phone companies could install a driving mode on phones, much like airplane mode, that would allow only directions, music and podcasts. It would turn on automatically in a moving car (and passengers could override it). The companies refusal to do so suggests that they take convenience more seriously than safety. Long term, technology can also take over more driving duties, like automatic emergency braking. I realize driverless cars make many people anxious. But automation has made airplanes vastly safer , and it will for cars, too. Remember Calabresis lesson: Even before distracted driving, cars claimed a toll that would be shocking if it had not become normal. Technology has now given us the choice between making a terrible problem worse and saving a lot of young, healthy lives.  You can join me on Twitter (@DLeonhardt) and Facebook .

Credit Hiroko Masuike/The New York Times        Its easy to get giddy about self-driving cars. Older people and preteens will become more independent and mobile. The scourge of drunken driving will disappear. People will be able to safely play video games while on the freeway to work. But there is one problem autonomous driving is unlikely to solve: the columns of rush-hour gridlock that clog city streets and freeways. If decades of urban planning and economic research are any guide, the solution is unlikely to come from technology but from something similar to Ubers surge pricing: charging people more to use driverless cars at rush hour. Not that technology companies arent trying to find other solutions to congestion. Traffic is one of the few problems that fabulously wealthy people cant buy their way out of. This helps explain why Elon Musk, the founder of Tesla and SpaceX, wants to bore subterranean freeways under Los Angeles and build a hyperloop train half the length of California. Or why Larry Page, Googles co-founder, is interested in flying cars . This is in addition to other, less revolutionary efforts, from companies like Sidewalk Labs, which is owned by Googles parent company and which aims to ease congestion by helping cities make better use of data. And of course there is the self-driving car, which, in addition to making roads safer, is supposed to help manage freeways by smoothing human flaws  like a tendency to engage in antsy braking and sudden lane changes  that make traffic worse.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   These various technologies share a common theme. One way or another, they promise to expand the nations roads  literally, in the case of Mr. Musks tunnels, figuratively, in the case of flying cars, and efficiently, in the case of self-driving ones. While it is possible that one or all of these technologies will increase road capacity to the point at which no amount of traffic will fill them, history gives us reasons to be skeptical.  Continue reading the main story         Advertisement   Continue reading the main story       Decades worth of studies show that whenever cities add roads, new drivers simply fill them up. This isnt because of new development or population growth  although thats part of the story  but because of a vicious cycle in which new roads bring new demand that no amount of further roads can satisfy. This has been studied at rush hour , studied on individual freeway projects and studied with large data sets that encompass nearly every road in the United States. With remarkable consistency, the research finds the same thing: Whenever a road is built or an older road is widened, more people decide to drive more. Build more or widen further, and even more people decide to drive. Repeat to infinity. Economists call this latent demand, which is a fancy way of saying there are always more people who want to drive somewhere than there is space for them to do it. So far anyway, nothing cities have done to increase capacity has ever sped things up. The extent of this failure was chronicled in a 2011 paper called  The Fundamental Law of Road Congestion , by the economists Gilles Duranton, from the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania, and Matthew Turner, from Brown University. The two went beyond road building to show that increases in public transit and changes in land use  basically, building apartments next to office buildings so that more people can walk or bike to work  also fail to cut traffic (or do so only a little). This doesnt mean public transit and land planning are bad ideas, or that widening freeways is a bad idea. When roads are bigger, more people can get around. More people see family; more packages are delivered; more babies are lulled to sleep. It just means that none of those measures have done much to reduce commute times, and self-driving cars seem unlikely to either. Thats where charging people during busy times comes in. Maybe autonomous cars will be different from other capacity expansions, Mr. Turner said. But of the things we have observed so far, the only thing that really drives down travel times is pricing.

Only when the drive is far enough or the traffic is bad enough  or a taxi costs enough  will more people choose to bike, car-pool, hop on a train or postpone a trip. This same pattern shows up in all kinds of places. You can see it in car-centric cities like Los Angeles and Houston , where yearslong, multibillion dollar lane-widening projects did little to speed commutes.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   But you can also see it in New York  by far the most transit-friendly city in the United States. Ride-hailing services like Lyft and Uber have led to increased auto traffic, according to a February study from Schaller Consulting in Brooklyn, while subway trips dipped slightly in 2016 because of a fall in weekend usage. Bruce Schaller, principal of Schaller Consulting, said if the growth in ride-hailing services continued, it would inevitably push the city toward some sort of congestion pricing system, an idea New York has floated and rejected . There will be so many cars on the streets, and freight deliveries and buses and everyone else will be so slowed down, that people will get fed up and demand a solution, he said. And we have a solution in pricing. Things like matinee movies, red-eye airfares and happy hour drinks have accustomed Americans to the idea of variable pricing depending on time. But charging more for roads is toxic , at least in the United States. Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg met abject failure with his attempt at congestion pricing in New York. Yet London, Singapore and Stockholm have all put in such systems effectively. In the United States, the most common objection is that road pricing is regressive: Rich people get to drive alone while the masses huddle on a bus. Also, people just dont like paying for things that they are used to having free. Economists are hoping that may change. Several states, including California, Texas and Minnesota , have added high-occupancy toll lanes with different pricing during rush hours. This idea of congestion pricing is not completely dismissed the way it once was, said Clifford Winston, an economist at the Brookings Institution. Mr. Winston said the eventual introduction of self-driving cars would probably lessen consumer opposition to paying more to use roads during peak periods. Ride-hailing apps have taught consumers to accept surge pricing, and people are generally less resistant to paying for something new. The result would be something like variably priced lanes dedicated to fleets of robot vehicles.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   If that happens, one of the hidden benefits of this revolutionary new technology will be that it got people to accept an idea that economists started talking about at least a century ago .

By DAPHNE RUSTOW on Publish Date March 6, 2017.  Photo by Edu Bayer for The New York Times.  Watch in Times Video          embed            There are few things more aggravating than rush-hour traffic in Midtown Manhattan. Now, local officials are questioning whether ride-hailing apps like Uber are adding to the pain. The New York Timess Emma G. Fitzsimmons and Winnie Hu write that more than 50,000 drivers in the city are now working for ride-hailing apps. That shift has coincided with lower taxi fares, lower taxi medallion prices and, for the first time since 2009, lower subway ridership  even though the citys population, and the number of jobs there, keeps increasing. According to city data, average travel speeds in the heart of Manhattan dropped to about 8.1 miles per hour last year, down about 12 percent from 2010. The appeal of hailing a vehicle via Uber, Lyft or a similar service is obvious: Instead of cramming into a subway car or lurching through traffic on a bus, a rider can take a car as a more relaxed, albeit more expensive, alternative. And the cost of some services can be as low as $5, which doesnt sound so bad if youre carrying a bag full of groceries.

By DAPHNE RUSTOW on Publish Date March 6, 2017.  Photo by Edu Bayer for The New York Times.  Watch in Times Video          embed               When Uber arrived in New York City in 2011, subway ridership was soaring and the medallions required to drive a yellow cab were selling for a sky-high $1 million. But Uber had an enticing offer: Your ride could appear at the touch of a button. Six years later, Uber and other ride-hailing apps are booming , an army of nearly 50,000 licensed vehicles that ferry hundreds of thousands of people across the city every day. Ride-hailing apps, like Uber and Lyft, are rapidly transforming transportation in New York, emerging as an existential threat to the taxi industry and siphoning passengers away from subways and buses, while raising concerns over worsening street congestion. They are also expanding quickly across the country, altering the travel landscape in places with poor public transit. In New York  Ubers largest United States market  yellow cab trips are dropping, while the use of ride-hailing services has skyrocketed to about 16 million passengers in October from about five million in June 2015, according to an independent report on ride-hailing apps. The price of a taxi medallion has plummeted, many drivers have abandoned cabs for ride-hailing services and taxis sit idle in garages.

Continue reading the main story         Advertisement   Continue reading the main story       The price of a car pool ride with the apps can be as low as $5  a fee that for many seems worth it when the alternative is spending $2.75 to use a century-old subway system plagued by rising delays .  Photo        A Lyft ride on the Upper East Side.   Credit Edu Bayer for The New York Times    Its hit a point where people are choosing to travel by ride-hailing because the subways have become intolerable, said Thomas K. Wright, president of the Regional Plan Association, an urban policy group. Subways and buses have absorbed much of the citys growth in recent decades as subway ridership has hit levels not seen since the middle of the last century. But both have become less appealing  buses trapped in traffic, prolonged waits for trains, packed platforms and all-too-frequent mechanical breakdowns. Patricia Martinez has switched from the bus to an app called Via. It is more comfortable, she said, and the $5 flat rate in most of Manhattan is not much more than the bus. I wouldnt be able to afford to pay yellow taxis all the time, said Ms. Martinez, who lives on the Upper East Side. The price makes a difference, and the cars are very good. Lilja Owsley uses Lyft to travel late at night from her job at a wine bar in Chelsea to her home in Bushwick, Brooklyn. Id rather just take an Uber or Lyft instead of waiting for the L train for 10 or 15 minutes, she said. And while ride-hailing services predominantly serve Manhattan, they are spreading to parts of the city where public transit is limited and taxis are scarce.

I want to avoid walking a long distance to the subway station, she said.  Continue reading the main story        Photo        The commuter rush for the L train at 14th Street. Subway ridership dropped last year for the first time since 2009, but stations are still crowded.   Credit Edu Bayer for The New York Times       But the proliferation of ride-hailing vehicles appears to be contributing to increasingly gridlocked streets. Average travel speeds in the heart of Manhattan dropped to about 8.1 miles per hour last year, down about 12 percent from 2010, according to city data. Subway service must become more competitive because it is unsustainable for the city to grow by adding more vehicles, said Bruce Schaller, a former senior transportation official for the city who prepared the report on ride-hailing services. This is a wake-up call that action is needed now to deal with delays, crowding and a host of problems that people experience every day on the transit system, he said. A spokeswoman for the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, the agency that runs the citys subways and buses, said it was working to modernize the system and improve service. With frustration over congestion rising, Mayor Bill de Blasio has promised a comprehensive traffic plan in the coming weeks, though he may be reluctant to confront Uber after the uproar he faced in 2015 when he tried to cap its number of vehicles. He ultimately backed down . The citys transportation commissioner, Polly Trottenberg, said her agency was working to assess the impact of ride-hailing services. Theres no question they have provided a convenient new service and a lot of people are making use of them, she said. But I think theres also no question that if they continue to grow in popularity and add a lot of new car trips to the streets, we have to look at the externalities, which could include congestion, lower air quality, reduced safety or declining transit usage.

Credit Edu Bayer for The New York Times    The largest ride-hailing apps in New York  Uber, Lyft and Via  and their supporters said there were many reasons for the growing congestion, including construction, truck deliveries and thick pedestrian traffic. The companies said they actually reduced congestion through more efficient use of streets and considered themselves a supplement rather than a substitute for public transportation.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   Lyfts goal is to replace private car ownership, not transit, walking or biking, said Adrian Durbin, a Lyft spokesman. Still, ride-booking services are succeeding at the expense of others. The Metropolitan Transportation Authority has taken a hit to its budget because it receives financing from a 50-cent surcharge on taxi trips. Officials say the shift from taxis to Uber and other apps has cost the authority about $28 million since 2014.

Nicole Gelinas, a senior fellow at the Manhattan Institute, said ride-hailing apps were able to lure riders with artificially low prices because they were subsidized by an influx of cash by investors. The apps have made it easier for people to travel by the most inefficient mode of transportation possible, she said. Many transportation experts support a plan to reduce congestion by charging drivers to enter the core of Manhattan. Other cities, like London, have put such congestion pricing in place, and former Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg pushed unsuccessfully in 2008 for a similar proposal . Pickups by ride-hailing apps in New York are concentrated in Manhattan below the area around 96th Street  about 56 percent, according to Mr. Schallers report . About 22 percent of trips start in the rest of Manhattan and nearby neighborhoods, like Williamsburg in Brooklyn and Long Island City in Queens. Neighborhoods farther from Manhattan account for about 19 percent of trips, and just over 3 percent of pickups are at the citys two major airports, La Guardia and Kennedy International.  Photo        Congestion on New York streets has been worsening. Average travel speeds in the heart of Manhattan dropped to about 8.1 miles per hour last year, down about 12 percent from 2010.   Credit Edu Bayer for The New York Times    Andrew Salzberg, who oversees transportation policy and research for Uber, said about 33 percent of total Uber pickups started and ended in boroughs outside Manhattan. Despite their appeal, the apps have faced a wave of criticism, including concerns over wheelchair accessibility and driver pay. Uber has also been rocked by a series of problems in recent weeks, prompting many users to delete its app. The company was accused of trying to profit during airport protests against President Trumps first immigration order and criticized over sexual harassment claims by a former engineer. And accusations surfaced recently about a tool Uber was said to have used to deceive the authorities in several cities and countries.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   Other cities have struggled to regulate the growth of ride-hailing services. Uber left Austin, Tex., last year after losing a ballot measure over regulations, but that was an exception  ride-hailing apps operate in over 300 communities, and some cities are actually partnering with the services. In Summit, N.J., officials began a commuter program offering free or discounted Uber rides to a New Jersey Transit station instead of building more parking. Some transit officials view the apps as an ally in their efforts to persuade urban dwellers to resist car ownership. People who use Uber and Lyft often were more likely to use public transportation, according to a study last year by the American Public Transportation Association that examined seven cities, including Washington and Boston. Weve seen that its been a symbiotic relationship between public transit and these tech-enabled services, said Darnell Grisby, director of policy for the association. But in New York, where fewer than half of residents have a car, people have long relied on public transit and yellow cabs, and many are using the apps to replace those transportation modes. For William Prince, 31, who lives in Windsor Terrace, Brooklyn, price is all that matters. He uses whichever app is offering the best promotion, especially when the subway is unreliable. The F and G trains have been kind of a nightmare recently, he said. Usually the cost benefit is its worth the money to avoid the hassle.

Our number one advice for renters is to do their homework, said David Solomito, vice president of marketing for North America at Kayak . For most people, rental cars are the least considered part of trip. As technology has changed travel  consider toll roads, which often do not have manned tollbooths any longer  so it has the rules of the road when it comes to renting cars. Its not dramatic in terms of what companies are charging in fees, its just that theres more of them, said Rick Garlick, who leads the global travel and hospitality practice at J. D. Power, which conducts consumer surveys, including an annual survey on car rental satisfaction (for the third year running, Enterprise has ranked highest). Ancillary fees, as with airlines, are how the companies retain profitability, he said.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   There are a number of ways to save money on rental cars, including renting from a location thats not at an airport, which Kayak says will save you an average of 11 percent. But there are several charges that tend to nip renters wallets after they return their cars that can be avoided or reduced with a little forethought.  Continue reading the main story         Advertisement   Continue reading the main story       Refueling Assuming you havent purchased any refueling options when you signed the contract, rental car agencies require renters to return the car with the same amount of gas as when they departed, which usually means full. But the mileage range between topping off the tank and reaching the return facility is a gray area. At Hertz, we do not have a mileage restriction. We simply ask that customers refuel to the same level they started with, wrote Lauren Luster, communications manager with Hertz, in an email. This lack of definition is open to exploitation both from drivers who refuel miles away and from agencies. I recently returned a car to Avis in Miami after refueling a block from the airport return terminal, only to find a fuel service charge of $16.07 on my bill. An Avis employee redacted it when I objected. A spokeswoman for Avis said the company has about 40,000 connected cars, which measure fuel levels when exiting and re-entering the rental facility. We carefully monitor the system and work closely with car manufacturers, so the likelihood that the technology in the vehicle malfunctioned is slim, wrote Alice Pereira, an Avis spokeswoman, in an email. Industry experts advise making a mental note of the closest gas station when you drive away from the rental facility. Cars arent getting smarter, we need to be, said Lauren Fix, an author and automotive writer also known as the Car Coach . If you have a receipt to prove you refilled, they will usually refund the fee. Any pushback, I ask for a manager. Tolls Drivers are responsible for paying their own tolls, but a shift to electronic tolling has made it harder for renters to avoid the fees charged by agencies as manned booths have disappeared from many routes.

But once they are triggered by a tollgate, the devices initiate a daily rental fee, often regardless of whether it is used each day. These fees are in addition to the actual tolls, so that while you may only incur a few dollars in tolls driving from Miami to Key West, you will pay somewhere between $2.95 a day for the device at Payless Car Rental to $4.95 a day with Hertz. These fees are usually capped. Avis charges a maximum of $19.75 per rental month; Hertz charges $24.75 maximum per rental agreement; and Payless charges $14.75 maximum for each rental period.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   Enterprise, National and Alamo car rentals offer the use of automatic tolling for $3.95 per day it is used, with a maximum charge of $19.75 for the rental term. Car rental companies stress that drivers can pay cash (when the option exists), avoid toll roads or bring their own electronic transponders from home. Not all electronic passes are linked, however. The E-ZPass can be used in most Northeastern and mid-Atlantic states and a few in the Midwest, extending from Maine down to North Carolina and west to Illinois. An E-ZPass may be used in various vehicles as long as they are in the same class as your car, so forget using it if you rent a tractor-trailer. Some toll roads in California will allow drivers to register a credit card to the rental car license plate and have the tolls charged automatically. Early and Late Returns Many consumers assume that an early rental return will spare them the fee remaining for the balance of the contract. That doesnt take into account the lost revenue that the rental car company incurs. It messes with their inventory and planning, said Mr. Solomito of Kayak. Returning a car early is considered breaking the contract. How early is early depends on the company, but generally anything less than 24 hours before the return date requires payment of the full amount. If earlier, Dollar Rent A Car , for example, will only charge for the days used and add a $25 charge, according to the company website, to compensate us in part for our inability to rent your vehicle during the remaining time we have reserved for your use. Late returns generally trigger fees. And like airline rebooking, any changes may result in a different rate than the one originally agreed to. Hertz encourages customers to call its Rental Extensions department. They may be subject to a $10 return-change fee, through renters can avoid the fee if they change a return date when they pick up the car. If they dont call, however, they can be subject to a fee of $12 a day, up to a maximum of $60, in addition to daily rental charges. Traffic and Parking Violations Parking or traffic tickets are the drivers responsibility. But if ever there were a financial incentive to driving carefully, its in a rental car, where ticket fees may come with a service charge from the rental company. These penalties are usually detailed in the terms and conditions of the rental contract. Aviss contract says offenses will be charged back to the renters credit card, and the company may impose a $30 administration fee to cover the cost of notifying the renter of the infraction by sending copies of the notices. Payless charges a $50 fee per violation.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   What the big print giveth, the little print taketh away, Ms. Fix said. You have to be aware.

Credit Marlene Awaad/Bloomberg     SAN FRANCISCO  Travis Kalanick, chief executive of Uber, is seeking a No. 2 executive to lend him a hand after a bumpy start to his year. Mr. Kalanick issued a one-sentence statement on Tuesday saying, Were actively looking for a Chief Operating Officer: a peer who can partner with me to write the next chapter in our journey. An Uber spokesman declined to comment beyond the statement. Mr. Kalanicks search for a chief operating officer follows several blows to Uber this year that have raised questions about the ride-hailing companys workplace culture and business tactics. Some of the concerns have extended to Mr. Kalanicks character, and Tuesdays announcement shows how he intends to restructure the executive suite to get more help, while continuing to lead the company. Mr. Kalanick said last week that he needed to change as a leader and grow up, adding that I need leadership help, and I intend to get it. He spoke as part of an apology for berating an Uber driver in February, an incident that was captured on video and made public.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   Beyond the video, Uber has been reeling from allegations from former employees about a discriminatory and brutal culture; a lawsuit from Waymo, a self-driving vehicle rival , that claims an Uber executive stole intellectual property from it; and a social media-driven campaign to delete the Uber app . On Friday, The New York Times reported that Uber has for years used a secret tool called Greyball to identify and circumvent authorities who were trying to clamp down on the ride-hailing service.

He has taken a pugilistic style toward pushing Ubers services into cities and towns around the world, often flouting laws and regulations, and has spoken publicly about how his company helped him attract women. Filling an executive position at this level will not be easy. Generally speaking, talent is very tight, and the pool of available executives within the technology industry is small, said Richard Marshall, a partner with the executive search firm Korn Ferry. And for fast-growing, founder-led companies, its hard to find someone with the skills needed who is a cultural fit.

Eric Schmidt, now chairman of Alphabet, was once known as the adult supervision for Googles young founders, Larry Page and Sergey Brin. At Facebook, the social network, Mark Zuckerberg, the chief executive, brought in Sheryl Sandberg, a respected tech executive who is now the companys chief operating officer.

What they found, however, was by no means routine. Behind the wheel on Sunday was a 22-year-old woman from Britain in a distressed state with visible facial injuries. In the back of the sport utility vehicle was a man hiding under clothes and other items. The police said that the man, identified only as a 22-year-old from Cairns, in northeastern Australia , had kept the woman captive for two months, raping and assaulting her as they traveled for hundreds of miles across the state of Queensland. Detective Inspector Paul Hart of the Queensland Police said on Tuesday that the woman, a British citizen who reportedly came to Australia in 2015 but who has not been publicly identified, had been held against her will after a brief relationship with the suspect soured.

The man has been charged with several crimes, including rape, assault, strangulation, deprivation of liberty and drug offenses, that would have been quite traumatic, Inspector Hart said. The suspect was denied bail after appearing in court in Roma on Monday, the BBC reported.

It has taken great courage for our victim in this instance to provide the details she has. The circumstances the woman was in would likely have made it difficult for her to escape. She was frequently traveling in a remote area, and the BBC, citing the Queensland Police, reported that the suspect had damaged and invalidated her passport. The woman has made contact with her family in Britain, the BBC reported, although it was not clear when she would be able to return home. The British Foreign Office said it was supporting a British woman following an incident in Queensland, news reports said.   Michael Wolgelenter contributed reporting from London.

Harvick won the first two stages under Nascars new format and led 293 out of 325 laps over all. But after a yellow flag came out when Austin Dillon lost power, Harvick, in the No. 4 Stewart-Haas Racing Ford, eclipsed the 45-miles-per-hour speed limit going into the pits for his final stop. The penalty pushed Kyle Larson to the lead, but Larson could not hold off Keselowski, who surged ahead on the backstretch with six laps to go and held on for a 0.564-second victory.
