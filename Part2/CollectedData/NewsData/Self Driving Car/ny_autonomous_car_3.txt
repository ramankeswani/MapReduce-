The system can be used to track people in the volatile Xinjiang region in far western China.   Credit The New York Times     Officials in Chinas largest prefecture, in the far-western region of Xinjiang, are requiring all drivers there to install a Chinese-made satellite navigation system in their vehicles, according to an official news report this week. Police officials say drivers must install the navigation system by June 30. The installation rate will reach 100 percent, said a report on Monday on the website of The Korla Evening Post, a newspaper in the prefectures capital, Korla. The report was also posted on the government-managed website of Beidou , the Chinese satellite navigation system. Beidou is Chinas version of the Global Positioning System, or GPS. The new requirement is intended to help the authorities track people in a region where violence sometimes erupts because of ethnic tensions. Parts of Xinjiang are home to ethnic Uighurs , a Turkic-speaking people who mostly practice Sunni Islam and often resent policies made by the ethnic Han, the dominant group in China. The most notable burst of violence occurred in 2009, when ethnic rioting convulsed Urumqi , the regional capital, resulting in about 200 deaths, most of them ethnic Han, according to official reports. Officials responded with a harsh security crackdown. Other episodes have resembled domestic terrorism, and some officials say the attackers have connections to groups engaged in global jihadist activities, but they have not offered any evidence to buttress that claim.

Oasis towns with heavy Uighur populations lie to its west. The prefectures population is 32 percent Uighur and 59 percent Han, according to official statistics, even though the prefectures name implies that Mongolians are a significant population. (In fact, they are 3 percent of the total.)  Continue reading the main story         Advertisement   Continue reading the main story       Last year, central Communist Party officials appointed Chen Quanguo as the new party chief of Xinjiang. Mr. Chen formerly oversaw the Tibet Autonomous Region, which also has chronic problems involving ethnic conflict. Mr. Chen has tried to roll out more hard-line policies. It seems likely that he hopes to get a seat this fall on the Politburo, a top governing body in the party. Nicholas Bequelin, the East Asia director for Amnesty International, said the requirement to install the navigation system was consistent with Xinjiangs important role as a trial ground for Chinas ambition to create a world-class, high-tech counterterrorism force. While preventing terrorist attacks is a legitimate concern for the government, Mr. Bequelin said, the kind of indiscriminate, quasi-totalitarian policies rolled out in Xinjiang under Mr. Chen are bound to create a deep pool of resentment that will indeed turn into a real time bomb for China.

Security forces then shot people whom the report described as rioters. Forty people died, including some who blew themselves up, the report said. In 2013, a Uighur farmer used a knife to kill at least five people and wound seven, according to an official report. News of the navigation system requirement first appeared in a post on the official microblog of the Bayingol traffic police department on Feb. 4. The post said: In recent years, the international antiterrorism situation has been grim. Cars are the main means of transport for terrorists and have become a frequently chosen tool in terrorist attacks. Another post said that on Feb. 19, police officers met to discuss the requirement. After that, a post appeared telling car owners about the order. Since then, all those posts have been deleted from the official microblog account, but cached versions were saved and are viewable online. In the past week and a half, officials in Xinjiang have ordered paramilitary units and police officers to hold large rallies in at least three cities with significant Uighur populations as demonstrations of force. A report on the official regional government website said the rally at a central square in Urumqi involved at least 10,000 security officers and hundreds of vehicles.

The Haggler has, for a long time, tried to make it clear that this nitwit is not to be confused with the Haggler, but the message does not seem to be getting through. If anything, the nitwit  Hey Haggler. Can you stop with the insults, please? Ive been pretty patient with your attacks, which are completely gratuitous, for years. The nitwit speaks! Hey, how about if you zip it for the time being, hmmm? For, like, another five or six minutes. Because nobody comes to this space to listen to you. Seriously. They come for the Haggler. They come for consumer justice. Exactly! And the sooner you stop interrupting, the sooner well get to consumer justice.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   Wow. Deep breaths. You see, dear readers, what the Haggler puts up with? Its sad. But it wont deter the Haggler, who in this episode learns more than he needs to know about vintage cars.  Continue reading the main story         Advertisement   Continue reading the main story       Q. In May, I placed an ad on Craigslist to sell my 1969 Plymouth Road Runner, hoping to pocket at least $23,000. I was soon contacted by a rep at Dusty Old Cars, in Nashua, N.H., who said if I consigned the car to the company it would transport the vehicle to its premises, post photos on its website  which is viewed by buyers around the world  and net me as much as $35,000. Good deal, it seemed. We signed a contract, stipulating that I would be paid a minimum of $23,000. Or so I thought. In August, I was enraged to get a check from Dusty for a little more than $18,000. The company had accepted an offer of $23,000 from which it subtracted a 10 percent commission, a number of fees and nearly $2,000 in repairs. I maintain that the car was in fantastic shape  it had been almost completely refurbished  and these repairs were unnecessary. Im not sure you can get any of my money back, but maybe you could make sure others dont fall into the same trap.  Joseph Mastromarino, Derry, N.H. A. Mr. Mastromarino is one of dozens of unhappy Dusty Old Cars customers. The New Hampshire attorney generals office has a list of nearly 90 complaints about the company on its site , and James Boffetti, the states senior assistant attorney general, told the Haggler that the office is currently investigating the company. Customers were told time and again, We sold your car for $10,000 but we put $6,000 of repairs into it, Mr. Boffetti said on the telephone. So minus our commission, heres a check for $3,000. He added that some customers were not paid a cent for their vehicles. Anthony Marotto, for instance, told the Haggler that he was paid unsatisfactory amounts for six of the 10 cars he consigned to Dusty and a grand total of zilch for four of them. At least Mr. Marotto was never threatened with a lawsuit. That happened to Stephen Kelly, who received nada for the 1970 Cadillac DeVille that he had consigned to Dusty. After posting a complaint to a Better Business Bureau of New Hampshire website, he got a call from Dustys owner, Stephan Condodemetraky, who is heard in a TV news report about the matter, broadcast last year, issuing a warning on a voice mail message: You know, it took me about five minutes for me to locate you, sir. So its going to take about five minutes for my lawyer to locate you, too. And then were going to come after you personally. Thats after we file criminal charges with the police departments.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   The Haggler thinks it is time for readers to meet Mr. Condodemetraky, a highly voluble character with an affinity for long explanations and a deep love of jargon. (Instead of jalopy he prefers materially problematic asset.) But first a little heads-up. Do not expect this guy to retreat an inch. People are dishonest, he said during two surprisingly entertaining conversations last week. Mr. Condodemetraky said that Mr. Mastromarino, for instance, had completely misrepresented the state of his Road Runner, and that the repairs performed were required to sell the car for $23,000. Further, he said, those repairs were allowed under the terms of the contracts Mr. Mastromarino signed. As for Mr. Marotto and the four cars that didnt yield him a dime, expensive and needed repairs wiped out any profit that he might have expected, Mr. Condodemetraky said. Obvious question: Why not tell Mr. Marotto that he is going to wind up with nothing before the repairs or the sales occur? We told him at least three or four times, Mr. Condodemetraky said. Not only did we do that, we took him through the mechanical inspection of each asset. Untrue, said Mr. Marotto. Before he learned through the Haggler that the cars had been sold, he added, he had considered filing a stolen car report. What about the 89 complaints on the attorney generals website, the Haggler asked Mr. Condodemetraky. Weve done almost 6,000 transactions since we opened in 2011, he said. Lets say 5,500. Eighty-nine complaints is about 1.5 percent of all our customers. He wondered: Can The New York Times match that tiny ratio of satisfied to unsatisfied customers? The Haggler is in no position to say. But you get the picture. In Mr. Condodemetrakys view, every one of his critics is lying or mistaken, or both lying and mistaken. But the sheer number of those critics is taking a toll. Last week, Dusty Old Cars filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy, listing between $500,000 and $1 million in liabilities and naming 19 ex-customers in its list of creditors with the largest unsecured claims.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   Do you think this has led Mr. Condodemetraky to rethink his business model? Oh, you are adorable. We continue to operate, he said, with some pride. We consigned cars today and we sold cars today.   EMAIL: haggler@nytimes.com  or tweet to @TheHagglerNYT.

Credit Bosch     The PC revolution, the internet boom, the smartphone economy  all were propelled along by a common set of technological standards. So will a standard platform or operating system be necessary to get autonomous cars rolling, too? There is certainly no doubt that many carmakers have expressed the idea that a more standardized platform would be attractive, said John Wall, a senior vice president at QNX , which develops software that is used in millions of vehicles today. Car companies have come to realize that existing in-car systems, with their tangled layers of software and morass of hundreds of embedded processors, are slow and overly complex by todays computing standards. If autonomous cars are ever to become a reality, they will require even more powerful, more fully integrated and upgradable computing platforms, designers say. The feedback we hear is that the number of chips, the amount of wire  an Audi has over six miles of wire in it  is excessive, said Danny Shapiro, senior director of automotive at the chip maker Nvidia , which is promoting its own autonomous driving platform.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   A more centralized approach could bring huge cost savings by reducing the number of processors used in a car and thus reducing the need for the cabling among those processors. Less wiring would also lower a cars weight to improve fuel economy, Mr. Shapiro said.  Continue reading the main story         Advertisement   Continue reading the main story       Nvidia is currently working with several automakers, including Audi, which plans to have its first self-driving vehicles on the road in 2020 . A common automotive platform could also make it easier to develop new software and safety systems for self-driving cars. The goal is to reduce the cost of bringing innovation to the mass market, said Eric Montague, a senior director at the speech recognition company Nuance .     Graphic  The Race for Self-Driving Cars  There are increasing signs that autonomous cars have arrived  and may be driving on our city streets sooner than we think.         OPEN Graphic      Mr. Montague said the challenge today is that every car has a unique constellation of electronic control units, sensors and microphones. The software must be specially tailored to each model. There is no shortage of companies vying to become the equivalent for self-driving cars of the Windows/Intel standard for PCs. Chip makers like Nvidia  as well as Intel  hope to establish their hardware as the new brains behind autonomous vehicles. Delphi, QNX and Waymo (the former Google self-driving project) are looking to put their software front and center as the operating system of choice. Each wants to sell its own car platform to automakers. Some auto companies are embracing new partnerships. BMW is working with Intel, Mobileye and Here to bring self-driving cars to the road and plans to start testing such vehicles this year. Ford is working closely with QNX, a BlackBerry subsidiary, on the software needed for the vehicles it is testing. Fiat Chrysler has built a new experimental fleet of minivans for Waymo . The traditional automotive culture, however, has emphasized independence. And some industry experts point to economic factors that argue against settling on a standard platform. Being dependent on a single vendor can mean higher prices. Automakers dont want to rely on Apple or Google, said Glen DeVos, vice president for software and services at Delphi. But they also dont want to reinvent the wheel all the time.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   Emblematic of that carmaker culture is Hyundai, which is mostly going it alone in working on its self-driving entry. The company recently demonstrated how far it has come, ferrying journalists in Las Vegas around in a self-driving version of its Ioniq electric compact car. Hyundai, which likes to emphasize that it even makes its own steel, has developed its own platform, striving for affordability. You dont have to use a common system, said Cason Grover, senior group manager for vehicle technology planning innovation at Hyundai. And we dont want to go down one path that hinders us in the future from introducing new innovations. Bosch, which supplies safety and technology systems to automakers, including its own self-parking technology, acknowledges that a single, one-size-fits-all system would be easier to work with. But it would be a killer for innovation, said Detlef Zerfowski, vice president for automotive system integration at Bosch.  Photo        Hyundai is developing its own system for a self-driving version of its Ioniq electric compact car.   Credit Hyundai    Douglas L. Davis of Intel, recently charged with spearheading that companys new self-driving car platform, Go, said, Given the amount of computing power necessary for autonomous driving, we think it can benefit from greater commonality and predictable interfaces. Mobileye already has the computer vision, for example, he said. So if the technology is good, why re-engineer it and take two to three years to get it into a product? Which design philosophy one chooses can have significant repercussions when it comes to the security of robotic cars, evoking visions of hackers causing mayhem by crashing cars and trucks into each other at highway speeds. Its a problem engineers are keenly aware of. Having a common platform could have a downside, Mr. Wall at QNX acknowledged. If theres a vulnerability in one car, it could mean theres a vulnerability in every car. Conversely, Mr. Wall pointed out that de facto software standards mean that more programmers are focused on making those systems as secure as possible, versus having only a few coders working on a single, narrowly used program.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   But by developing as much of the technology as possible themselves, some automakers believe they can solve problems more quickly. A side benefit of controlling the entire thing, said Mr. Grover at Hyundai, is that we know everything thats going on. A lack of standards and a diversity of self-driving systems does present one other obvious challenge: Variety is not a virtue when cars must interact predictably with human drivers  and other robotic vehicles  to guarantee safety.  Photo        Audi, which is working with the chip maker Nvidia, plans to have its first self-driving vehicles on the road in 2020.   Credit John F. Martin for Delphi    Riding in Hyundais self-driving Ioniq, for example, is like taking a Sunday drive with your grandmother. The car is extremely adept at staying squarely in its lane without ping-ponging back and forth, but it is also cautious in the extreme, stopping nine feet short of crosswalks and stubbornly refusing to go forward if a pedestrian looks poised to step off the sidewalk. It is behavior that can ignite road rage in nearby human drivers. By comparison, Delphis test car, which uses an Intel computing platform installed in an Audi Q5 , is more aggressive. It can easily merge into highway traffic and negotiate complex intersections. However, it treats pedestrians with less deference, taking right-hand corners more quickly  even though pedestrians may be contemplating entering the crosswalk. Theres a big difference in the algorithms and even sensor choices being used, Mr. Grover said, which can affect how collision-prevention and lane-keeping systems work. When autonomous cars do hit the road, he said, you could have a fair amount of variation in how they behave. There are quite a few different approaches to creating autonomous systems, said Ralf Herrtwich of Here, which is making high-resolution maps for the next generation of vehicles. Mr. Herrtwich said the necessary standards might come not from the car platform itself, though, but from the communications side. In order to avoid accidents down the road and conditions like black ice that a cars sensors cannot detect, self-driving vehicles will have to share information with each other, through so-called V2V or vehicle-to-vehicle communication. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration has proposed that V2V equipment be installed in all cars in the future.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   Indeed, there are already cars like the 2017 BMW 5 Series that can broadcast information about road hazards over a cellular connection, but only other BMWs can make use of the warnings. Technology suppliers, platform vendors and automakers acknowledge that self-driving cars are still in their infancy and that as the vehicles mature, standards will be forthcoming. Most car manufacturers are still struggling just to establish standards across their own models and brands, Mr. DeVos of Delphi said. Once that happens, he said, then we can talk about how to work across different companies.

When Uber bought Otto, Mr. Levandowski became Ubers vice president in charge of its self-driving car project.   Credit Ramin Rahimian for The New York Times     SAN FRANCISCO  Late last year, Uber, in defiance of California state regulators, went ahead with a self-driving car experiment on the streets of San Francisco under the leadership of Anthony Levandowski, a new company executive. The experiment quickly ran into problems. In one case, an autonomous Volvo zoomed through a red light on a busy street in front of the citys Museum of Modern Art. Uber, a ride-hailing service, said the incident was because of human error. This is why we believe so much in making the roads safer by building self-driving Ubers, Chelsea Kohler, a company spokeswoman, said in December. But even though Uber said it had suspended an employee riding in the Volvo, the self-driving car was, in fact, driving itself when it barreled through the red light, according to two Uber employees, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they signed nondisclosure agreements with the company, and internal Uber documents viewed by The New York Times. All told, the mapping programs used by Ubers cars failed to recognize six traffic lights in the San Francisco area. In this case, the car went through a red light, the documents said.    Video by Charles Rotter   The description of the traffic violation reflects Ubers aggressiveness in its efforts around self-driving cars and the ambition of its project leader, Mr. Levandowski, who is now at the center of a lawsuit brought against Uber by Waymo , an autonomous car business. Waymo is Googles cousin company under their parent entity, Alphabet .

Continue reading the main story         Advertisement   Continue reading the main story       After leaving Google in January 2016, Mr. Levandowski formed the self-driving truck company Otto. About six months later, Uber bought Otto for $680 million, and Mr. Levandowski became Ubers vice president in charge of its self-driving car project. Waymo filed a lawsuit on Thursday in federal court against Uber and Otto, accusing Mr. Levandowski and Uber of planning to steal trade secrets. The suit said Mr. Levandowski retrieved information from a highly confidential server with designs of crucial technologies used in its autonomous vehicles in the month before he resigned from Google, where he had spent nine years working on maps and self-driving cars.     Graphic  The Race for Self-Driving Cars  There are increasing signs that autonomous cars have arrived  and may be driving on our city streets sooner than we think.         OPEN Graphic      Alphabet and Uber view autonomous vehicles as using critical technology that may upend the automobile industry. Google started working on driverless cars around the time when Uber was formed, and Google is eager to prove that, despite its size and past successes, it can still innovate like a start-up. And replacing human drivers with self-driving cars would allow Uber to theoretically provide safer rides around the clock. Robot cars would also allow the ride-hailing service to avoid one of its biggest headaches  its drivers. Theres an urgency to our mission about being part of the future, Travis Kalanick, Ubers chief executive, said in an interview in August after announcing Ottos acquisition. This is not a side project. This is existential for us. Engineers like Mr. Levandowski are part of a limited pool of people with the experience and capability to lead efforts on self-driving cars. They are wooed by traditional automakers looking to acquire new technical talent and tech companies, both established firms and start-ups, who see the opportunity to use artificial intelligence and sensors to disrupt another industry. Whats in these peoples heads is hugely in demand, because the talent pool just doesnt have enough miles under the wheels, said Martha Josephson, a partner in the Palo Alto, Calif., office of Egon Zehnder, an executive recruiting firm.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   In fact, Sebastian Thrun, who founded Googles self-driving car project and is now the chief executive of the online teaching start-up Udacity, said last year that the going rate for driverless car engineering talent was about $10 million a person. Current and former co-workers of Mr. Levandowski, who asked for anonymity because they did not have permission to speak to reporters, said he was aggressive and determined with an entrepreneurial streak. Since leaving Google, Mr. Levandowski, 36, has embodied the Silicon Valley ethos that it is better to ask for forgiveness rather than permission.

But in an internal email to Uber employees obtained by The New York Times, Mr. Levandowski said that Otto did not steal any of Googles intellectual property, and that self-driving technology has been his lifes passion, having worked on it since his college days. He alluded to sharing more information with employees when he could in the future. A Waymo spokesman declined to comment on whether the company would refer its claims to law enforcement.     5 Things That Give Self-Driving Cars Headaches  Despite their multitude of sensors and processors, autonomous cars have a lot of trouble with some everyday aspects of driving.             Mr. Levandowski first gained renown as a graduate student at the University of California, Berkeley, in 2004, when he designed a riderless motorcycle that was entered in the Pentagons first contest for autonomous vehicles. A profile in The New Yorker, published in 2013 , said Mr. Levandowski grew so focused on overcoming the bikes technical hurdles that he offered $5,000 to the girlfriend of a team member, who Mr. Levandowski felt was being distracted, to end the relationship. He joined Google in 2007 as part of its Maps team and helped to build the companys Street View product. When Google gave the green light to begin working on a self-driving car in 2009, Mr. Thrun picked Mr. Levandowski for the original team. Mr. Levandowski gained some notoriety within Google for selling start-ups, which he had done as side projects, to his employer. In his biography for a real estate firm, for which he is a board member, Mr. Levandowski said he sold three automation and robotics start-ups to Google, including 510 Systems and Anthonys Robots, for nearly $500 million. After this story was published, the real estate firm updated its website erasing Mr. Levandowskis biography and said that it had erroneously reported certain facts incorrectly without Mr. Levandowskis knowledge.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   During Mr. Levandowskis time on Googles self-driving car project, the companys advances pushed autonomous vehicles out of the realm of science fiction. By late 2016, nearly 60 of Googles self-driving cars had driven more than two million miles on the road in four different states. But according to former co-workers, Mr. Levandowski became frustrated with the pace of progress at Google, worrying that the company was squandering its technical advantage by not moving fast enough. When Otto was unveiled in May, it showcased a flashy video of one of its trucks on a haul through the Nevada desert. The star of the show was the drivers seat, completely empty, as the truck drove itself down the highway. But that test drive was carried out without the proper permits and against the will of the Nevada Department of Motor Vehicles, a move that the agency eventually called illegal. When Uber bought Otto, Mr. Levandowski found a kindred spirit in Mr. Kalanick, who is also known for pushing the rules. In an interview with Bloomberg Businessweek in August 2016, Mr. Kalanick said they were brothers from another mother. After one week of testing in San Francisco last year, Uber backed down from its fight with California regulators and announced it was pulling its self-driving Volvos out of the city after the states D.M.V. revoked the registrations of the vehicles. When asked on Friday about the incident with the red traffic light, Ms. Kohler, the Uber spokeswoman, said in a statement: Our self-driving technology required human intervention. The vehicle operator had time to intervene, but failed to take over before crossing the stop line and manually proceeded through the protected crosswalk. In December, Uber said it remained 100 percent committed to eventually bringing autonomous vehicles to California. Nonetheless, the company loaded its Volvos onto a flatbed truck, and took them to Tempe, Ariz., a city more friendly to testing self-driving vehicles. In bold black letters stamped across the trucks white cab was the name of the truck operator: Otto .   Correction: March 1, 2017   An article on Saturday about talent in the driverless technology field referred incorrectly to comments by Anthony Levandowski, a former Google engineer who started the self-driving truck company Otto, which was bought by Uber and is at the center of a lawsuit by another autonomous car business, the Google affiliate Waymo. The statement, denying that Otto stole any of Googles intellectual property, was paraphrased from an internal company email; it was not a direct quotation from Mr. Levandowski.

Credit Andy Wong/Associated Press     The Mercedes-Benzes, the BMWs and the Land Rovers were largely brand new when federal agents seized them in late 2013, claiming that the small Tennessee company that planned to resell them to wealthy buyers in China was engaging in an insidious fraud. But a federal jury in Manhattan disagreed. It took jurors three hours on Wednesday to determine that there was not enough evidence to support a civil forfeiture lawsuit filed by federal prosecutors. The jury, in ruling in favor of the Efans Trading Corporation, ordered the government to return the luxury cars and $3 million in cash that was also seized from a company bank account. We are grateful that the jury saw this case for the government overreach that it was, said Benjamin J. Razi, a partner with the law firm Covington & Burling, which represented Efans. Even with the victory they deserved, this case took a tremendous toll on our client. Efans, based in Memphis, is owned by Yifan Kong and Erxin Zhou, a husband and wife who are Chinese immigrants. The government action effectively forced the couple to shut their car export business, although they still operate a tire importing company.

It represents something of a conclusion to an aggressive crackdown by federal law enforcement on a cottage industry of auto export companies that used middlemen and straw buyers to buy luxury cars from dealerships in the United States and quickly resell them for big profits in China.  Continue reading the main story         Advertisement   Continue reading the main story       The auto export companies sought to take advantage of the demand for luxury cars in China and get around efforts by manufacturers to control the number of cars sold in China and other countries. The auto manufacturers claimed that the export firms were violating standard business practices and using deception to buy cars in the United States. They pressed federal law enforcement to crack down on the exporters. The crackdown was the focus of a 2014 article in The New York Times . In 2015, federal prosecutors began to back away from bringing straw-buyer luxury export cases as part of an overall review of the federal governments asset forfeiture program. Justice Department officials in Washington counseled prosecutors to either drop or settle forfeiture cases filed against auto export firms unless the authorities could find evidence of real criminality  like tax fraud or evidence that export firms had hired people using forged drivers licenses to buy cars for quick resale in China. A number of open civil forfeiture cases brought by federal prosecutors against auto export firms were either settled or dropped  but not the case that Mr. Bhararas office had brought against Efans.

A spokeswoman for Mr. Bharara declined to comment. In November 2013, when Mr. Bhararas office filed the forfeiture case, he issued a statement that said Efans had defrauded dealerships, insurance companies and authorities in its scheme to export luxury automobiles in violation of the law. The jury reached a unanimous verdict in favor of Efans after a seven-day trial before Judge Katherine Polk Failla of Federal District Court in Manhattan. In recent years, asset forfeiture proceedings have come under broad criticism because of the ability of federal and state authorities to seize property without necessarily filing criminal charges and before proving that a crime has occurred. The Justice Department under the Obama administration moved to reform some of these practices in light of that criticism.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   It is not clear how the Trump administration will proceed on civil forfeiture. At a White House meeting with sheriffs from around the country, the president made an offhand remark that seemed to suggest support for aggressive state asset forfeiture laws. The lawyer for Efans, Mr. Razi, said he hoped that Wednesdays jury verdict would send a message to law enforcement about being judicious in seizing assets through civil forfeiture because the burden often rests on the defendants to prove they did nothing wrong. There is a great risk of abuse with these laws, and we hope they take that into account, he said.

Cadillacs have been used by every president since Woodrow Wilson. Credit Scott Olson/Getty Images By  James B. Stewart Feb. 23, 2017 Can a luxury auto ad help bridge the deep political chasm in America  and, while its at it, sell cars? General Motors Cadillac division is about to find out. On Sunday, its new advertising campaign will make its debut during the Oscars broadcast on ABC, which is, after the Super Bowl, the biggest showcase for national television ads. (ABC said it had sold out the broadcast, taking in about $2 million per 30-second spot.) In an effort to distinguish the company from its German and Japanese rivals in the luxury car segment, Cadillacs advertising slogan for the past three years has been Dare Greatly. In the opening line of its new 60-second ad, thats just what Cadillac seems to be doing. Over footage of a street demonstration, the narrator says bluntly, We are a nation divided. We had to get the elephant out of the room, Uwe Ellinghaus, Cadillacs chief marketing officer, told me this week when I visited Cadillacs sleek headquarters in Manhattans SoHo neighborhood for a preview of the ads. You cant deny this. At the same time, you hear this, and you stop immediately. It gets your attention. The opening line ends with a subtle but important qualifier: Thats what they tell us, right? This chasm between us. It then moves swiftly to a far more positive and inclusive message: What they dont tell us is that we carry each other forward, no matter who we are, or what we believe, or where we come from. Mr. Ellinghaus told me emphatically that he was trying to avoid any partisan stand. We can have a point of view without adding fuel to any controversial political debate, he said. We did a lot of soul searching. What has happened to the American dream? We wanted to celebrate what America is capable of. While that may not be impossible in the age of President Trump, it has become far more difficult  as some advertisers learned at their peril during this months Super Bowl. Mr. Trumps election has caused a tectonic shift in advertising  just as it has in media more generally  and themes that might have once seemed innocuous or patriotic have suddenly become politically charged, controversial and divisive. Budweisers flagship Super Bowl message was a gauzy paean to Adolphus Busch, who emigrated to St. Louis from Germany in 1857, was told he was not wanted here, yet persevered to create Budweiser and a sprawling brewing empire. According to Anheuser-Busch InBev, as the company is now known, the ad was conceived long before Mr. Trumps election, and was simply intended to highlight the ambition of our founder, Adolphus Busch, and his unrelenting pursuit of the American dream. Yet the ad prompted an anti-Budweiser boycott campaign on social media by Trump supporters. With Mr. Trumps treatment of women an issue, a Cadillac rival, Audi, ran an overtly issue-oriented Super Bowl ad, showing a mans daughter winning a downhill cart race against an all-boys lineup. Audi of America is committed to equal pay for equal work, the ad intoned. Progress is for everyone. But critics quickly charged that such progress apparently stops at Audi headquarters in Ingolstadt, Germany: Audis board of management has no women on it. The ad attracted thousands of dislikes on Facebook, and a social media campaign accused Audi of liberal bias. (Audi has defended the ad and said it was working aggressively to promote women in management.) Advertisers are bracing for any backlash to Sundays Oscars ceremony ads, especially since Meryl Streep drew Mr. Trumps wrath and a Twitter barrage after criticizing him at this years Golden Globes award ceremony. When it comes to Mr. Trump, Cadillac faces a more delicate task than most. The president and his wife, Melania, arrived at the inauguration in a heavily armored custom Cadillac known as the Beast, and the Cadillac brand is indelibly linked to the White House. Cadillacs have been used by every president since Woodrow Wilson. Image Uwe Ellinghaus, chief marketing officer of Global Cadillac, said, We can have a point of view without adding fuel to any controversial political debate. Credit Paul Sancya/Associated Press Like most major national ads, work on Cadillacs Oscars campaign began nearly a year ago, when Mr. Ellinghaus had dinner with Arthur Sadoun, chief executive of the advertising agency Publicis Communications (and now chairman and chief executive of Publicis Groupe), to discuss this years campaign. Cadillac was in the third year of an ambitious effort to reposition itself as a distinctive global brand. The first iteration of the Dare Greatly campaign featured the chanteuse Edith Piaf and iconoclastic personalities like the Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak. Both Mr. Sadoun and Mr. Ellinghaus thought the campaign needed to evolve, while remaining true to its origins. Still, it didnt take the results of an election to know the American public was polarized, Mr. Sadoun said. Mr. Ellinghaus was adamant that the ad not be overtly political. On the other hand, I didnt see how we could shy away from the division in the country, he said. We didnt want to enter the political debate. We wanted to transcend it. Perhaps it took two non-Americans  Mr. Sadoun is French, Mr. Ellinghaus is German  to suggest that by acknowledging the divide, an ad campaign might actually help heal it. After all, America had been divided before in its history  at times far more than now. (Hence the image of a civil rights demonstration.) The nation had overcome the divisions, moved forward and prospered, the American dream intact. For many years (though not in recent decades), the Cadillac brand embodied that dream. Perhaps Cadillacs ad could remind Americans of the nations resilience and inherent optimism, and celebrate what America is capable of, Mr. Ellinghaus said. So the ad moves from images of civil strife to scenes of Americans helping one another and overcoming adversity: police officers embracing; American soldiers returning from battle in Afghanistan; a father running behind his paraplegic son in the last Olympics triathlon; a Hurricane Katrina rescue mission. We may not be the same, but we can be one, the narrator concludes. All it takes is a willingness to dare. Cadillac executives didnt do any formal market testing of the ad, but they did preview it for a few audiences, including a group of Texas Cadillac dealers, who gathered in Dallas a few weeks ago for a meeting with their division leaders. If the ad was likely to cause a backlash from pro-Trump factions, dealers from Texas were as likely as anyone to anticipate it. Usually they walk us through the concept, the strategy, what they were hoping to achieve, said Jacquelin Sewell, who manages Cadillac dealerships in Dallas, Houston and San Antonio as part of the family-owned Sewell Automotive. This time they just showed it and said the work should speak for itself. The reaction, she said, was overwhelmingly enthusiastic. Were all a part of a national conversation that in many ways is very negative, she said. But when I talk to our customers on an individual level, theres a lot of hope. People still believe in the potential of this country. I feel this taps into that in a very powerful way. Cadillac has struggled in recent years to translate higher quality and praise from the automotive press for its new models into higher sales in the United States. Last year, Cadillacs sales in the United States dropped 3 percent to 170,000 units even as overall automotive sales hit a record 17.55 million. (Global sales, however, rose 11 percent, making it Cadillacs best year for sales in three decades.) So I had one major question: With only a few glimpses of actual Cadillacs in the ad, and all of those vintage models, will it actually sell cars? That, everyone involved with the campaign told me, isnt the main goal of this particular ad. (It will be followed during the awards ceremony with other Cadillac ads spotlighting specific models.) This is a long-term investment that will elevate the brand, in Mr. Sadouns view. Cadillac realizes that it needs to connect with buyers emotionally, Ms. Sewell said. Thats never been more true than now in the luxury space. In the ad, Cadillac is identified with unity, optimism, courage  the great American values, she said. I think dealers and customers, too, are hungry to hear something positive like this. Whether Cadillac has managed to transcend the nations bitter political divide is ultimately for the audience to decide, Mr. Ellinghaus acknowledged. If you have to explain it afterwards, youve failed. Correction :  The Common Sense column on Friday, about Cadillacs new advertising campaign, described the opening scene from a commercial incorrectly. The footage was of a recent street protest and was made to look archival, not of a civil rights demonstration from the 1960s. The column also misstated, at one point, the given name of a founder of the company that makes Budweiser beer, which was the subject of an ad campaign that recently became politically charged. He was Adolphus Busch, not Augustus.

Credit Jeff Swensen for The New York Times     SAN FRANCISCO  Waymo, the self-driving car business spun out of Googles parent company, claimed in a federal lawsuit on Thursday that Uber was using intellectual property stolen by one of Googles former project leaders. In a federal court filing in San Francisco, Waymo said Anthony Levandowski, who runs Ubers autonomous car division, downloaded 14,000 files from Google a month before leaving to start his own self-driving car company, Otto. Uber acquired Otto in August for $680 million, about seven months after Mr. Levandowski left Google. Otto and Uber have taken Waymos intellectual property so that they could avoid incurring the risk, time, and expense of independently developing their own technology, the company said in the filing. Ultimately, this calculated theft reportedly netted Otto employees over half a billion dollars and allowed Uber to revive a stalled program, all at Waymos expense. Uber did not respond to requests for comment. In its filing, Waymo said it was inadvertently copied on an email from one of its suppliers with drawings of Ubers circuit board design for its lidar technology, short for light detection and ranging,  that are laser-based sensors used in self-driving cars. Waymo said Ubers design bore a striking resemblance to its proprietary and highly secret design and infringed on Waymos patents.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   Waymo also said that a number of Google employees, who subsequently left to join Mr. Levandowski at Otto, downloaded additional trade secrets before departing. These included supplier lists, manufacturing details and technical information, Waymo said.

The suit accuses Uber of stealing trade secrets, infringing on patents and competing unfairly in an effort to catch up on autonomous vehicle technology.  Continue reading the main story         Advertisement   Continue reading the main story       Otto was the brainchild of a handful of former Google employees who pioneered autonomous vehicle research at the search giant. Mr. Levandowski, who had been at Google nine years, led that effort. He is a prominent figure in the world of self-driving vehicles, having worked on the technology for more than a decade and achieving some degree of renown as a graduate student at the University of California, Berkeley, in 2004, when he designed a self-driving motorcycle that was entered in the Pentagons first contest for autonomous vehicles. Later, when Google began working on self-driving cars, it acquired Mr. Levandowskis start-up, 510 Systems. Mr. Levandowski left Google in early 2016 to found Otto with Lior Ron , who also was experienced in autonomous vehicle research and digital mapping. Waymo noted in its suit that the sale to Uber closed shortly after Mr. Levandowski received his final multimillion dollar compensation payment from Google. Companies in Silicon Valley and Detroit are betting big on self-driving car technology. And the intense interest has spawned a string of expensive investments and lawsuits. Last year, General Motors paid more than $1 billion for Cruise Automation, an autonomous vehicle technology start-up, and Ford recently announced plans to invest $1 billion over five years in Argo AI, an artificial intelligence start-up formed in December.          OPEN Document    Document: Waymos Complaint Against Uber    In January, Tesla filed a lawsuit against Sterling Anderson, a former director of the companys Autopilot program, saying that he broke his employment contract by trying to recruit Tesla employees to join a new self-driving car company. Teslas suit, filed against Mr. Anderson and his partner Chris Urmson, a former Google employee, also claims that Mr. Anderson took proprietary information and tried to cover his tracks by destroying information.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   In December, Googles parent company, Alphabet , said that its seven-year-old autonomous vehicle project was spinning off from its research lab X and would operate as a stand-alone company called Waymo. Alphabet said its decision to spin out Waymo was a signal that the company thought its self-driving technology had advanced beyond research project status and was ready for commercialization. Waymo executives have said it is open to using the technology in many ways, including a ride-hailing service to compete with Uber.

Mr. Levandowski was named vice president of Ubers self-driving technology, and he reports directly to Travis Kalanick, the companys chief executive. Mr. Levandowski leads Ubers Advanced Technologies Center in Pittsburgh, the epicenter of the companys testing and self-driving efforts. Uber has said it could be years before self-driving vehicles enter wide mainstream use. But the company has already deployed early tests in Pittsburgh and Tempe, Ariz ., where the public can travel in prototype vehicles. In Fort Collins, Colo., Otto recently completed its first self-driving truck delivery, a 120-mile beer delivery for Budweiser. Uber has also struck a deal with Volvo to jointly develop a self-driving vehicle, the XC-90; early versions of it have been released in some cities.     Graphic  The Race for Self-Driving Cars  There are increasing signs that autonomous cars have arrived  and may be driving on our city streets sooner than we think.         OPEN Graphic      In December, Uber ran into opposition to a test of its self-driving Volvo XC-90s in San Francisco, an operation the California Department of Motor Vehicles said was illegal because Uber did not hold the proper permits . One week later, Uber relented, redirecting its test to Tempe and pulling a fleet of its self-driving cars out of the Bay Area. Uber, now privately valued at nearly $70 billion, has raised a dizzying amount of money from venture capitalists around Silicon Valley. One of its early investors was GV, the venture capital arm of Alphabet. In August, David Drummond, a longtime Alphabet executive who was instrumental in GVs $250 million investment in Uber in 2013, stepped down from his seat on Ubers board of directors as it became increasingly clear the two companies were on a collision course. It has been a difficult week for Uber. The company is still reeling from a blog post written by Susan Fowler , a former Uber employee, who claimed she was sexually harassed by a manager at the company and was ignored when she complained to the human resources department. The company said it was investigating Ms. Fowlers claims and other concerns about a toxic workplace culture . Mitch and Freada Kapor, early investors in Uber, wrote in a blog post on Thursday that they are frustrated with the companys inability to change its culture, despite their attempts to help. They also expressed concern about the independence of the investigation, which will be led by Eric H. Holder Jr., the former United States attorney general, and Arianna Huffington, an Uber board member. Mr. Holder has been paid to work on behalf of Uber since at least 2016, they wrote, and Ms. Huffingtons board seat also compromises her independence.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   Mr. Holder and Tammy Albarran, a partner at the law firm Covington and Burling who is working on the investigation, said the inquiry would be thorough, impartial and objective.

To understand why it came about, it is worth looking back at Snaps history. It seems that the situation was spurred by dealings with Jeremy Liew , a venture capitalist at Lightspeed Venture Partners. The terms of Mr. Liews 2012 investment gave him outsize power over the companys next investment round. This irked Mr. Spiegel, who took steps to reassert control. He struck a deal to allow Lightspeed to buy shares at a discount in exchange for it removing certain onerous terms, like a right-of-first-refusal on the next funding round. He later authorized the creation of a class of preferred stocks, which would have 10-to-1 voting rights. Trump Looks to Manufacturing Executives President Trump has promised to bring jobs back.

It started the hot hatch segment, and it remains the one to beat.  By TOM VOELK on Publish Date February 23, 2017.  .  Watch in Times Video          embed            Volkswagen has spelled fun with the letters GTI since 1983 in the United States. Based on the utilitarian Rabbit (the name America got instead of Golf back in the day), the original hot hatchback was a revelation. Until then, Americans believed performance cars needed rear-wheel drive and thirsty V8 engines. Pulled by the front wheels, the 90-horsepower 4-cylinder GTI ran with Pontiac Trans Ams clad with Screaming Chicken decals. Still, I understand why Burt Reynolds didnt do Smokey and the Bandit in a hatchback. Ive been fortunate to drive many expensive high-performance cars, and yet one particular romp in a sixth generation GTI remains near the top of my fun chart. The new Golf, riding on Volkswagens MQB architecture, is even better. But first the lows. The SE model tested is one rung down from the top-tier Autobahn edition and lacks automatic climate control. The sunroof is large-ish but far smaller than a Kia Soul s. Finally, some wont forgive Volkswagen for the sins of the diesel. Fair enough. The rest, save for getting stuck in a muddy cornfield, is positive. You can buy a base S model for $26,415. (Thats less than a Ferrari bumper.) My SE tester lists for $30,715. Id add the $595 Driver Assistance package with adaptive cruise control and autonomous emergency braking. Its a tough choice between the excellent 6-speed manual (bested only by the Mazda MX-5 Miata ) and the quick shifting $1,100 6-speed dual-clutch automatic transmission. Id go with the automatic. Wait, make it the manual. Hmmm, get back to me.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   The manual transmission is E.P.A.-rated at 24 city and 34 highway. Highway mileage drops two m.p.g. with the dual-clutch automatic.  Continue reading the main story         Advertisement   Continue reading the main story       Drinking premium fuel, the 2-liter turbocharged 4-cylinder delivers 220 horsepower, dropping to 210 horsepower with standard-grade gas. (The base S does not get that extra kick.) The 258 pound-feet of torque surges early in the rev range for quick starts. Steering weight, throttle and exhaust note can be adjusted. The Autobahn version gets an adjustable adaptive suspension. A buying tip: Skip the S for the Sport. The $2,400 jump provides bigger brake discs and an adjustable differential that can send full power to either front wheel and quell torque steer (steering wheel tugging during hard starts). The drive I so fondly remember happened on an impossibly empty and dry Northern California road with more twists than a M. Night Shyamalan script. This time, the pavement never improved past damp, and the new GTI had tires optimized for dry pavement. This is what writers call foreshadowing. In ideal conditions, Car and Driver recorded a 0-to-60 sprint of 6.1 seconds and a respectable .93 lateral G rating on the skid pad (a measure of cornering grip). But forget numbers. GTI has that rarest of commodities in an affordable car  soul. In hard cornering, all sorts of electronic things happen. The inside rear brakes feather to deliver a more confident arc. More power may even be routed to one of the front wheels. But chances are, drivers will be completely unaware. The GTI forms a Vulcan mind meld between human and machine, high Zen during high jinks. The GTIs palpable refined quality feels a full grade more expensive than it is. The road and engine sound is appropriate for a performance car, but not intrusive. The ride quality is comfortable with little unwanted body movement or harshness. The GTI is like that friend in college who pushed you to party. Tempted once too often, I entered a water- and gravel-covered corner a skosh too fast, ending up with the passenger side axle-deep in farm mud.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   Perhaps it was penance for ripping up that California road years back. Two Our Ferraris and three Hail Mercedes (and a $260 towing bill) later, the GTI was ready for more. No damage done, just a bruised ego, a dinged wallet and a reminder to always drive within conditions. There was plenty of time to evaluate the interior while waiting for the tow. Materials are top notch. Cars twice the price dont get a flat-bottomed steering wheel, crisp red ambient lighting and soft lining in the door pockets to dampen rattles. The SEs exceptional Fender sound system is worth the extra charge. The SE also swaps out GTIs trademark Clark Plaid cloth for black leather. The heated seats hug like a mother after her childs week away at summer camp. Volkswagens snappy touch-screen user interface is above average and offers Apple CarPlay. Two average-size adults will be genuinely comfortable in the back seat, bisected by the drive shaft tunnel used in the high-performance R model (sure wish I had had all-wheel drive on that wet corner). The 60/40 split back seats are equipped with a ski pass-through. Drop the seats and the cavernous cargo hold can fit a bicycle. Or a winch. The VWs closest hot hatch competition is the Ford Focus ST. At just under $31,000 as tested, the GTI is tough to beat, with its triple threat of performance, refinement and utility. It does everything well. Except off-roading.

Credit Jabin Botsford/The New York Times     WASHINGTON  With Republicans now in power across the government, Congress has moved aggressively toward undoing Obama-era tech policies. Net neutrality , the rule that ensures equal access to all websites, and broadband privacy rules are the first targets. Lawmakers also hope to play a bigger role than in the last administration on policies of particular concern to Silicon Valley and internet users, including driverless cars and the scaling back of Federal Communications Commission powers concerning broadband providers. We talked to Senator John Thune , Republican of South Dakota, who leads the commerce committee that oversees the technology and telecommunications industries, about these efforts. The interview was edited for clarity and length. How do you want to change net neutrality rules? Were open for business. We think a legislative solution is the best alternative and that the F.C.C. under Chairman Tom Wheeler went too far with regulations that were overreaching and basically classified the internet as a public utility under a 1934 statute. Congress needs to be heard from, or you will have a constant back-and-forth on this issue depending on which party is in the White House.

Legislation would basically prevent blocking, throttling and paid prioritization but doesnt go to the extreme of reclassifying broadband as a telecommunications service.

On zero rating, F.C.C. Chairman Ajit Pai has already expressed a preference on that: It is something consumers seem to love. To be able to download or stream without letting it count against your data plan is extremely popular with consumers. I dont have a problem with that. Will you work with the F.C.C. chairman, and how will you get Democrats on board? It may take action by the F.C.C. first in order to get the stars aligned. I think that if the F.C.C. starts moving in the other direction, it might prompt Democrats on the Hill to say, You know what, maybe a legislation solution makes sense. What about broadband privacy rules created in early 2016? Senator Jeff Flake of Arizona and Representative Marsha Blackburn of Tennessee have proposed killing privacy rules through a shortcut legislative process known as the Congressional Review Act .

But I also think we want to get the best possible outcome that doesnt create two sets of privacy rules for broadband and edge web companies, which is what you have today. What can Congress do to help resolve the digital divide? What tools are at your disposal right away? We passed the Mobile Now Act, which was designed to expand spectrum access to get more wireless broadband. We want to get to 5G wireless broadband before anyone else. The Universal Service Fund is another area. How do you want to reform the Universal Service Fund, which allocates $8 billion a year to bring broadband to underserved areas? Weve tried to get broadband-only services covered under U.S.F. because now you have to offer phone and internet.

Do you believe in Lifeline, and what do you think of his actions? Like any government program, it ought to be run efficiently. There have been issues of it in the past in regards to abuse and waste. As for these nine providers, they were basically approved right before transition. What hes done is put them on a pending status. Youve been an advocate of driverless cars. How are you going to get driverless cars on the road faster? Autonomous vehicles have enormous potential to save lives. There are barriers that make it difficult not just for testing, but for developing these technologies. Some are simple, like requiring that in every vehicle there be a human steering wheel and a human accelerator. Were going to look at where are some of the barriers to these technologies that are standing in the way.   Follow Cecilia Kang on Twitter @ceciliakang .
