Salisbury/MCT, via Getty Images     ROME  A 10-year legal battle over the  extraordinary rendition  of a terrorism suspect by American intelligence agents seemed to draw nearer to resolution on Tuesday, when the president of Italy commuted part of a prison sentence that one former C.I.A. officer had been given in absentia. The presidents decree opens the way for the former officer, Sabrina de Sousa , 61, to avoid imprisonment, by serving her remaining sentence some other way, such as through monitored release or community service. Ms. de Sousa was indicted in 2007 , along with 25 other Americans, over the kidnapping of a radical Egyptian cleric in Milan in 2003. Several high-ranking Italian intelligence officials also were indicted, but the case against them fell apart when evidence was withheld from the court on national security grounds. Ms. de Sousa and the other Americans left Italy before the indictment, so they were tried and convicted in absentia. Most have remained beyond the reach of Italian law by not traveling to Europe. But Ms. de Sousa, who has both American and Portuguese citizenship, moved to Portugal in 2015 for family reasons. Since October 2015, she has been fighting in the Portuguese courts to avoid extradition to Italy; most recently, she was detained on Feb. 21 in Lisbon and was scheduled to be sent to Milan by Thursday.

Under Italian law, sentences of three years or less are eligible for alternatives to imprisonment.  Continue reading the main story         Advertisement   Continue reading the main story       After Mr. Mattarella acted, the Italian authorities revoked the arrest warrant that was the basis for the extradition order. Ms. de Sousa now has 30 days to petition a court in Milan for alternative punishment. It was not immediately clear when she would do so. Shell come to Italy to defend herself as a free woman, said Dario Bolognesi, Ms. de Sousas Italian lawyer, who has been seeking a pardon for his client for more than four years. Were very happy with the outcome. Had she gone to prison, Ms. de Sousa, would have been the first former C.I.A. operative to serve time in prison outside the United States over the controversial rendition program. Two of the Americans convicted along with her have been pardoned, and a third had his sentence reduced. Her role in the case came to light when Italian prosecutors were investigating the 2003 abduction of the cleric, Hassan Mustafa Osama Nasr, also known as Abu Omar, who was seized in Milan and taken to Egypt.

His case helped fuel a broad debate over the practice, begun after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, of abducting terrorism suspects and transferring them to other countries or to secret C.I.A. prisons abroad for interrogation. In the years since she left the C.I.A., Ms. de Sousa has been publicly critical of the rendition program. Even so, some human rights advocates expressed disappointment at the Italian presidents clemency for her. It is very worrying, and sends a clear message that you can engage in what amount to be crimes under international law  torture and enforced disappearance  and get away with it, said Julia Hall of Amnesty International. Pardoning people, or giving lesser sentences effectively letting them off the hook, is not the way to give victims of these crimes justice. Ms. Hall did, however, criticize the conviction in absentia of Ms. de Sousa, and said she should have the right to a fair retrial and the chance to contest the charges against her. Without that process, this remains unfinished business, she said.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   Under Italian law, Ms. de Sousa has exhausted her appeals, though, so a new trial did not appear to be a possibility. Mr. Mattarellas statement announcing the reduction of the sentence said he had taken into account that the United States had discontinued the rendition program and that her sentence was out of balance with the consequences others in the case had faced. Ms. de Sousas lawyer, Mr. Bolognesi, said her sentence was so clearly an injustice, when three others were pardoned, state secrecy was invoked for some defendants, and yet she was facing prison. It made no sense, in particular because she later took a strong position against renditions.   Follow Elisabetta Povoledo on Twitter @EPovoledo .

Some in his administration feared that intelligence about Russian interference in the 2016 election could be covered up or destroyed.   Credit Al Drago/The New York Times     WASHINGTON  In the Obama administrations last days, some White House officials scrambled to spread information about Russian efforts to undermine the presidential election  and about possible contacts between associates of President-elect Donald J. Trump and Russians  across the government. Former American officials say they had two aims: to ensure that such meddling isnt duplicated in future American or European elections, and to leave a clear trail of intelligence for government investigators. American allies, including the British and the Dutch, had provided information describing meetings in European cities between Russian officials  and others close to Russias president, Vladimir V. Putin  and associates of President-elect Trump, according to three former American officials who requested anonymity in discussing classified intelligence. Separately, American intelligence agencies had intercepted communications of Russian officials, some of them within the Kremlin, discussing contacts with Trump associates. The disclosures about the contacts came as new questions were raised about Attorney General Jeff Sessionss ties to the Russians. According to a former senior American official, he met with the Russian ambassador, Sergey I. Kislyak, twice in the past year. The details of the meetings were not clear, but the contact appeared to contradict testimony Mr. Sessions provided Congress during his confirmation hearing in January when he said he did not have communications with the Russians.

Mr. Trump has denied that his campaign had any contact with Russian officials, and at one point he openly suggested that American spy agencies had cooked up intelligence suggesting that the Russian government had tried to meddle in the presidential election. Mr. Trump has accused the Obama administration of hyping the Russia story line as a way to discredit his new administration.  Continue reading the main story         Advertisement   Continue reading the main story       At the Obama White House, Mr. Trumps statements stoked fears among some that intelligence could be covered up or destroyed  or its sources exposed  once power changed hands. What followed was a push to preserve the intelligence that underscored the deep anxiety with which the White House and American intelligence agencies had come to view the threat from Moscow. It also reflected the suspicion among many in the Obama White House that the Trump campaign might have colluded with Russia on election email hacks  a suspicion that American officials say has not been confirmed. Former senior Obama administration officials said that none of the efforts were directed by Mr. Obama. Sean Spicer, the Trump White House spokesman, said, The only new piece of information that has come to light is that political appointees in the Obama administration have sought to create a false narrative to make an excuse for their own defeat in the election. He added, There continues to be no there, there.

LISTEN ON YOUR PODCASTS APP    LISTEN ON RADIOPUBLIC             As Inauguration Day approached, Obama White House officials grew convinced that the intelligence was damning and that they needed to ensure that as many people as possible inside government could see it, even if people without security clearances could not. Some officials began asking specific questions at intelligence briefings, knowing the answers would be archived and could be easily unearthed by investigators  including the Senate Intelligence Committee, which in early January announced an inquiry into Russian efforts to influence the election. At intelligence agencies, there was a push to process as much raw intelligence as possible into analyses, and to keep the reports at a relatively low classification level to ensure as wide a readership as possible across the government  and, in some cases, among European allies. This allowed the upload of as much intelligence as possible to Intellipedia, a secret wiki used by American analysts to share information. There was also an effort to pass reports and other sensitive materials to Congress. In one instance, the State Department sent a cache of documents marked secret to Senator Benjamin Cardin of Maryland days before the Jan. 20 inauguration. The documents, detailing Russian efforts to intervene in elections worldwide, were sent in response to a request from Mr. Cardin, the top Democrat on the Foreign Relations Committee, and were shared with Republicans on the panel. This situation was serious, as is evident by President Obamas call for a review  and as is evident by the United States response, said Eric Schultz, a spokesman for Mr. Obama. When the intelligence community does that type of comprehensive review, it is standard practice that a significant amount of information would be compiled and documented.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   The opposite happened with the most sensitive intelligence, including the names of sources and the identities of foreigners who were regularly monitored. Officials tightened the already small number of people who could access that information. They knew the information could not be kept from the new president or his top advisers, but wanted to narrow the number of people who might see the information, officials said.     A Timeline of Jeff Sessionss Trump Ties and Meetings With Russia  Mr. Sessionss actions and the surrounding events.             More than a half-dozen current and former officials described various aspects of the effort to preserve and distribute the intelligence, and some said they were speaking to draw attention to the material and ensure proper investigation by Congress. All spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were discussing classified information, nearly all of which remains secret, making an independent public assessment of the competing Obama and Trump administration claims impossible. The F.B.I. is conducting a wide-ranging counterintelligence investigation into Russias meddling in the election, and is examining alleged links between Mr. Trumps associates and the Russian government. Separately, the House and Senate intelligence committees are conducting their own investigations, though they must rely on information collected by the F.B.I. and intelligence agencies. On Wednesday, a Justice Department official confirmed that Mr. Sessions had two conversations with Ambassador Kislyak last year, when he was still a senator, despite testifying at his Jan. 10 confirmation hearing that he had no contact with the Russians. At that hearing, Mr. Sessions was asked what he would do if it turned out to be true that anyone affiliated with the Trump team had communicated with the Russian government in the course of the campaign. He said he was not aware of any of those activities. I have been called a surrogate at a time or two in that campaign and I didnt have  did not have communications with the Russians, and Im unable to comment on it, Mr. Sessions said at the time. However, Justice officials acknowledged that Mr. Sessions had spoken with Mr. Kislyak twice: once, among a group of ambassadors who approached him at a Heritage Foundation event during the Republican National Convention in Cleveland in July and, separately, in an office meeting on Sept. 8. The contacts were first reported by The Washington Post.  Photo        President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia.   Credit Alexei Nikolsky/Sputnik    Sarah Isgur Flores, Mr. Sessionss spokeswoman, said there was absolutely nothing misleading about his answer because he did not communicate with the ambassador in his capacity as a Trump campaign surrogate. She said Mr. Sessions had at least 25 conversations in 2016 with ambassadors from a range of nations  including Britain, Japan, China, Germany and Russia  while on the Senate Armed Services Committee. The revelation prompted congressional Democrats to issue a torrent of statements reiterating their demands that Mr. Sessions recuse himself from overseeing any investigation into Russias contacts with the Trump campaign. So far, Mr. Sessions has demurred.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   Representative Adam B. Schiff, the ranking Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, said in a statement on Wednesday that if the reports about Mr. Sessions were accurate, it is essential that he recuse himself from any role in the investigation of Trump campaign ties to the Russians. Mr. Schiff added, This is not even a close call; it is a must. Representative Nancy Pelosi, the Democratic leader of the House, called on Mr. Sessions to resign, saying on Twitter that he is not fit to serve as the top law enforcement officer of our country. A White House official, speaking on the condition of anonymity, backed up Mr. Sessions late Wednesday, calling the accusations the latest attack against the Trump administration by partisan Democrats.

But he added that if there was, it is clear to me that Jeff Sessions, who is my dear friend, cannot make this decision about Trump. At his confirmation hearing on Wednesday, former Senator Dan Coats, Mr. Trumps nominee for director of national intelligence, told the Senate Intelligence Committee that I think its our responsibility to provide you access to all that you need. Some Obama White House officials had little faith that a Trump administration would make good on such pledges, and the efforts to preserve the intelligence continued until the administrations final hours. This was partly because intelligence was still being collected and analyzed, but it also reflected the sentiment among many administration officials that they had not recognized the scale of the Russian campaign until it was too late. The warning signs had been building throughout the summer, but were far from clear. As WikiLeaks was pushing out emails stolen from the Democratic National Committee through online publication, American intelligence began picking up conversations in which Russian officials were discussing contacts with Trump associates, and European allies were starting to pass along information about people close to Mr. Trump meeting with Russians in the Netherlands, Britain and other countries. But what was going on in the meetings was unclear to the officials, and the intercepted communications did little to clarify matters  the Russians, it appeared, were arguing about how far to go in interfering in the presidential election. What intensified the alarm at the Obama White House was a campaign of cyberattacks on state electoral systems in September, which led the administration to deliver a public accusation against the Russians in October.  Photo        Dan Coats, President Trumps nominee for director of national intelligence, has pledged cooperation in investigating the Russia allegations.   Credit Al Drago/The New York Times    But it wasnt until after the election, and after more intelligence had come in, that the administration began to grasp the scope of the suspected tampering and concluded that one goal of the campaign was to help tip the election in Mr. Trumps favor. In early December, Mr. Obama ordered the intelligence community to conduct a full assessment of the Russian campaign.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   In the weeks before the assessment was released in January, the intelligence community combed through databases for an array of communications and other information  some of which was months old by then  and began producing reports that showed there were contacts during the campaign between Trump associates and Russian officials. The nature of the contacts remains unknown. Several of Mr. Trumps associates have done business in Russia, and it is unclear if any of the contacts were related to business dealings. The New York Times, citing four current and former officials, reported last month that the American authorities had obtained information of repeated contacts between Mr. Trumps associates and senior Russian intelligence officials. The White House has dismissed the story as false. Since the Feb. 14 article appeared , more than a half-dozen officials have confirmed contacts of various kinds between Russians and Trump associates. The label intelligence official is not always cleanly applied in Russia, where ex-spies, oligarchs and government officials often report back to the intelligence services and elsewhere in the Kremlin.

Hall, the former head of Russia operations at the C.I.A., said that Mr. Putin was surrounded by a cast of characters, and that it was fair to say that a good number of them come from an intelligence or security background. Once an intel guy, always an intel guy in Russia. The concerns about the contacts were cemented by a series of phone calls between Mr. Kislyak and Michael T. Flynn, who had been poised to become Mr. Trumps national security adviser. The calls began on Dec. 29, shortly after Mr. Kislyak was summoned to the State Department and informed that, in retaliation for Russian election meddling, the United States was expelling 35 suspected Russian intelligence operatives and imposing other sanctions. Mr. Kislyak was irate and threatened a forceful Russia response, according to people familiar with the exchange. But a day later, Mr. Putin said his government would not retaliate , prompting a Twitter post from Mr. Trump praising the Russian president  and puzzling Obama White House officials.   On Jan. 2, administration officials learned that Mr. Kislyak  after leaving the State Department meeting  called Mr. Flynn, and that the two talked multiple times in the 36 hours that followed. American intelligence agencies routinely wiretap the phones of Russian diplomats, and transcripts of the calls showed that Mr. Flynn urged the Russians not to respond, saying relations would improve once Mr. Trump was in office, according to multiple current and former officials.

American intelligence agencies made it clear in the declassified version of the intelligence assessment released in January that they believed Russia intended to use its attacks on the United States as a template for more meddling.

Putin of Russia a killer, Mr. Trump did not object . He just responded that there are plenty of killers in America, too. At this point, we can only speculate about the true nature of relations between the American and Russian presidents. No matter what, Mr. Trump came up with the perfect answer  the one most likely to appeal to Mr. Putin. (The Kremlin demanded an apology only from Mr. OReilly; if Mr. Trump had said that Mr. Putin was not a killer, the Kremlin might have requested an apology from the White House, too.) In Russia during the Putin era, a remarkable phenomenon has emerged: Accusations have become decoupled from crimes. In an ordinary society, if a man is called a killer, he will either deny it or admit his guilt. Twenty-first-century Russia has chosen a third path: to take pride in ones crimes while at the same time claiming to have no involvement in them. Its a tactic of intelligence agents and spies, people who work in the shadows. In 2005, Vladimir Kvachkov, a retired colonel in the military intelligence who had become an outspoken nationalist, was arrested in the attempted murder of Anatoly B. Chubais , who at the time headed the Russian electricity monopoly and who in the 1990s had been a leading reformer in the government. Attackers tried to blow up Mr. Chubaiss car and sprayed it with automatic weapons. While many raised questions about the prosecution, evidence pointed at Mr. Kvachkov: A car used by the would-be assassins reportedly belonged to Mr. Kvachkovs wife. A jury, though, acquitted him, citing insufficient evidence. (Mr. Kvachkov was later sent to prison on very separate charges: He was accused of being part of a right-wing coup plot.) It wasnt Mr. Kvachkovs acquittal that was remarkable about the case. It was his line of defense. On one hand, he denied a role in the crime; on the other, he argued that Mr. Chubais was an enemy of the Russian people and deserved to be killed. Its unclear which argument proved more persuasive to the jury, but probably the second. Popular opinion in Russia holds Mr. Chubais responsible for the poverty that set in as a result of the neoliberal economic reforms, and at various times both the left and the nationalist opposition have condemned him. Mr. Kvachkovs right-wing nationalist supporters deployed two mutually contradictory arguments: He did not shoot; hes not guilty and if he had shot, he would have been right to do so. If the first argument saved the man from a prison term for attempted murder, the second made him one of the leaders of the radical nationalist movement. The former K.G.B. officer Andrei K. Lugovoi had a similar experience. The British government is demanding his extradition in connection with the murder of Alexander V. Litvinenko , another former K.G.B. officer, who became a whistle-blower and died of polonium poisoning in London in 2006. Of course, Mr. Lugovoi does not admit his guilt. He goes even further in protesting his innocence, claiming that British intelligence was behind Mr. Litvinenkos assassination. But at the same time, both Mr. Lugovoi and the official Russian news media call Mr. Litvinenko a traitor. Russia didnt kill him, they suggest, but he deserved to be killed. Before he was accused of killing Mr. Litvinenko, Mr. Lugovoi had been an obscure ex-spy. Then, in 2007, he ran for Parliament and won. (It doesnt hurt that his election granted him parliamentary immunity.) In September he was re-elected to a third term. For Russia, Mr. Lugovoi became a hero for punishing a traitor. In 2015, Mr. Putin even awarded him a medal for risking his life in the line of duty. What exactly he had done one can only speculate, but the medal, of course, was not for killing Alexander Litvinenko. President Putins approach is not all that different from that of Mr. Kvachkov or Mr. Lugovoi. He is from the K.G.B., he is always on duty, and his mission is not to avoid committing crimes, but to commit them in such a way as to avoid being caught. There is no particular taboo associated with the crimes themselves. This formula explains Mr. Putins position on the war in Ukraine: Theres not the slightest doubt that Russian soldiers are confronting the Ukrainian Army in eastern Ukraine, but Vladimir Putin has made it a fundamental matter of principle to refuse to admit this. He is not a military man; hes a spy. For him, war is not war, but an espionage operation, and his most important objective is to maintain deniability. Russias domestic policy operates similarly. There are opposition parties, but most of them are managed by the Kremlin. In Chechnya, Ramzan A. Kadyrov , who is nominally independent but a close ally of Mr. Putin, rules with an iron fist. Hes suspected of ordering assassinations of dissidents, like Boris Y. Nemtsov , who are both his enemies and Mr. Putins. Of course, no one is able to demonstrate a Kadyrov connection in the killings. In the news media, the censors are invisible and its not known whether they even exist, but few doubt that the Kremlin controls the content of all the federal TV channels. Even government-funded film productions are managed like spy operations. One of the producers of a historical film about Czar Nicholas II recently told the Russian news website The Insider about receiving a gym bag full of cash from a Putin administration intermediary. Vladimir Putins Russia is an experimental space: one huge espionage operation that proceeds in complete secrecy. Personnel are appointed; billion-ruble deals are signed; laws are adopted, wars conducted. It would be downright strange if murders were committed according to some different pattern. In the standard investigation of a political killing in Russia today, the triggerman is arrested, but no one can name the guy who hired him. Oleg Kashin is the author of Fardwor, Russia!

Credit Manuel Balce Ceneta/Associated Press     WASHINGTON  Last year, when the United States and Iran exchanged prisoners, Secretary of State John Kerry announced that the Tehran government had also pledged to help in the search for a long-missing American who had disappeared in Iran in March 2007. To bolster that promise, Iranian officials secretly informed the Obama administration that they had received intelligence that the remains of an American had been buried in Balochistan, a rugged, lawless region in western Pakistan that borders Afghanistan and Iran. The remains, it was assumed, were that of the missing man, Robert A. Levinson, a private investigator and former agent for the Federal Bureau of Investigation who was also a part-time consultant for the Central Intelligence Agency. But when the Pakistani authorities went to the supposed burial site, they did not find any remains. American officials concluded that the report, rather than a gesture of good will, was a gambit by Iran to further cloud its role in Mr. Levinsons fate. Today, a decade after Mr. Levinson vanished, the Trump administration faces a decision about what steps to take, if any, to bring a resolution of his case. As a candidate, President Trump vowed in 2015 to bring Mr. Levinson home, and the Levinson family has asked to meet with him in hopes he will take a more aggressive stance toward getting answers than President Barack Obama did.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   While some American officials fear that Mr. Levinson died in captivity, his family remains convinced that he is alive and that officials in Iran know where he is.  Continue reading the main story         Advertisement   Continue reading the main story       Iran knows exactly what is going on with Bob, and they need to tell the U.S., his wife, Christine Levinson, said in an interview last month. A spokeswoman for the National Security Council, Jennifer Arangio, said in a statement that administration officials had contacted Mr. Levinsons relatives to assure them that his case was a priority. The U.S. government will never cease its efforts to bring back our citizens who are unlawfully detained or missing overseas, the statement said. Mr. Levinson traveled to an Iranian island on a rogue mission to recruit an intelligence source for the C.I.A. on March 7, 2007. He has been seen since then only in a hostage videotape made in 2010 and a series of photographs . Mr. Levinson was 59 when he disappeared and had health problems. For the past decade, Iranian leaders have repeatedly denied knowing anything about Mr. Levinson. But American intelligence and law enforcement authorities have long been convinced that elements of Irans political, religious or intelligence hierarchy such as the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps were involved in his detention and, possibly, his death. While the 2010 videotape showing Mr. Levinson as a prisoner gave no hint about who was holding him, F.B.I. investigators concluded that the video was so artfully staged that it was probably made by a state-sponsored intelligence group such as a unit of the Revolutionary Guards Corps. That videotape was also routed through Pakistan. Investigators believe the information about the burial of an American there was part of a continuing Iranian intelligence narrative meant to distance that country from Mr. Levinsons case, according to American officials.

Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   On two occasions last year, Iranian diplomats, when pressed by their American counterparts about Mr. Levinson, asked for information about the Iranian operative, Ali Reza Asgari , former American officials familiar with those talks said. Iran has long been seeking to locate Mr. Asgari, who reportedly took secrets about Irans nuclear program to the West with him. A former top officer in the Revolutionary Guards, Mr. Asgari went missing while on a trip to Istanbul. There was speculation at the time of Mr. Levinsons disappearance that he was seized in revenge for Mr. Asgari, but intelligence officials have played down that link. Nonetheless, Iran officials have long been hunting Mr. Asgari and for years have mentioned his name in connection with Mr. Levinson. Mr. Kerry, in a meeting in September with Irans foreign minister, Mohammad Javad Zarif, brought up Mr. Levinson, saying that the United States wanted a resolution of the missing Americans case, even if the information showed that Mr. Levinson had died. Those talks, which were unsuccessful, also involved efforts to resolve the cases of two Iranian-Americans: Siamak Namazi, a businessman in his 40s, and his father, Baquer Namazi. They are in an Iranian prison after their sentencing last fall on charges of spying and cooperating with the United States government. American officials have said the charges are false. In December, the United Nations Working Group on Arbitrary Detention issued an opinion, based on information supplied by Mr. Levinsons family, that Iran had illegally arrested and detained the investigator. The Iranian government, which was provided with a copy of the United Nations groups finding, did not respond. During his final years in office, Mr. Obama repeatedly said that bringing Mr. Levinson home was a priority. But his administration never publicly confronted Iran over its denials about Mr. Levinson or made public evidence gathered by the F.B.I. during its decade-long investigation of his case. The Obama administrations former special presidential envoy for hostage affairs, James OBrien, said he could not discuss specifics related to talks with Iran about the missing investigator. But he insisted that American officials had raised his case at every opportunity with the Iranians and tried everything we could think of to bring him home. One of Mr. Levinsons daughters, Sarah Moriarty, said that she was hopeful that Mr. Trump would make her fathers case a priority in all talks with Iran, which she said the Obama administration did not do. They didnt get him home, Mrs. Moriarty said. They failed.   Follow the reporters on Twitter @barrymeier and @adamgoldmanNYT .

Credit Stephen Crowley/The New York Times     WASHINGTON  The F.B.I. director, James B. Comey, asked the Justice Department this weekend to publicly reject President Trumps assertion that President Barack Obama ordered the tapping of Mr. Trumps phones, senior American officials said on Sunday. Mr. Comey has argued that the highly charged claim is false and must be corrected, they said, but the department has not released any such statement. Mr. Comey, who made the request on Saturday after Mr. Trump leveled his allegation on Twitter, has been working to get the Justice Department to knock down the claim because it falsely insinuates that the F.B.I. broke the law, the officials said. A spokesman for the F.B.I. declined to comment. Sarah Isgur Flores, the spokeswoman for the Justice Department, also declined to comment. Mr. Comeys request is a remarkable rebuke of a sitting president, putting the nations top law enforcement official in the position of questioning Mr. Trumps truthfulness. The confrontation between the two is the most serious consequence of Mr. Trumps weekend Twitter outburst, and it underscores the dangers of what the president and his aides have unleashed by accusing the former president of a conspiracy to undermine Mr. Trumps young administration.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   The White House showed no indication that it would back down from Mr. Trumps claims. On Sunday, the president demanded a congressional inquiry into whether Mr. Obama had abused the power of federal law enforcement agencies before the 2016 presidential election. In a statement from his spokesman, Mr. Trump called reports about the wiretapping very troubling and said Congress should examine them as part of its investigations into Russias meddling in the election.  Continue reading the main story         Advertisement   Continue reading the main story       In addition to being concerned about potential attacks on the bureaus credibility, senior F.B.I. officials are said to be worried that the notion of a court-approved wiretap will raise the publics expectations that the federal authorities have significant evidence implicating the Trump campaign in colluding with Russias efforts to disrupt the presidential election. Mr. Comey has not been dealing directly with Attorney General Jeff Sessions on the matter, as Mr. Sessions announced on Thursday that he would recuse himself from any investigation of Russias efforts to influence the election. It had been revealed on Wednesday that Mr. Sessions had misled Congress about his meetings with the Russian ambassador during the campaign. Mr. Comeys behind-the-scenes maneuvering is certain to invite contrasts to his actions last year, when he spoke publicly about the Hillary Clinton email case and disregarded Justice Department entreaties not to. It is not clear why Mr. Comey did not issue a statement himself. He is the most senior law enforcement official who was kept on the job as the Obama administration gave way to the Trump administration. And while the Justice Department applies for intelligence-gathering warrants, the F.B.I. keeps its own records and is in a position to know whether Mr. Trumps claims are true. While intelligence officials do not normally discuss the existence or nonexistence of surveillance warrants, no law prevents Mr. Comey from issuing the statement. In his demand for a congressional inquiry, the president, through his press secretary, Sean Spicer, issued a statement on Sunday that said, President Donald J. Trump is requesting that as part of their investigation into Russian activity, the congressional intelligence committees exercise their oversight authority to determine whether executive branch investigative powers were abused in 2016. Mr. Spicer, who repeated the entire statement in a series of Twitter posts , added that neither the White House nor the president will comment further until such oversight is conducted.

Mr. Comey is to testify Monday at the House Intelligence Committees first public hearing on its Russian interference investigation and could presumably resolve questions about the wiretap.   Credit Al Drago/The New York Times    A spokesman for Mr. Obama and his former aides have called the accusation by Mr. Trump completely false, saying that Mr. Obama never ordered any wiretapping of a United States citizen.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   A cardinal rule of the Obama administration was that no White House official ever interfered with any independent investigation led by the Department of Justice, Kevin Lewis, Mr. Obamas spokesman, said in a statement on Saturday. Mr. Trumps demand for a congressional investigation appears to be based, at least in part, on unproven claims by Breitbart News and conservative talk radio hosts that secret warrants were issued authorizing the tapping of the phones of Mr. Trump and his aides at Trump Tower in New York.

In one post, Mr. Trump said, Id bet a good lawyer could make a great case out of the fact that President Obama was tapping my phones in October, just prior to Election! On Sunday, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the deputy White House press secretary, said the president was determined to find out what had really happened, calling it potentially the greatest abuse of power that the country had seen. Look, I think hes going off of information that hes seen that has led him to believe that this is a very real potential, Ms. Sanders said on ABCs This Week. And if it is, this is the greatest overreach and the greatest abuse of power that I think we have ever seen and a huge attack on democracy itself. And the American people have a right to know if this took place. The claims about wiretapping appear similar in some ways to the unfounded voter fraud charges that Mr. Trump made during his first days in the Oval Office. Just after Inauguration Day, he reiterated in a series of Twitter posts his belief that millions of voters had cast ballots illegally  claims that also appeared to be based on conspiracy theories from right-wing websites. As with his demand for a wiretapping inquiry, Mr. Trump called for a major investigation into voter fraud, saying on Twitter that depending on results, we will strengthen up voting procedures! No investigation has been started. Senior law enforcement and intelligence officials who worked in the Obama administration have said that there were no secret intelligence warrants regarding Mr. Trump. Asked whether such a warrant existed, James R. Clapper Jr., a former director of national intelligence, said on NBCs Meet the Press, Not to my knowledge, no. There was no such wiretap activity mounted against the president-elect at the time, as a candidate or against his campaign, Mr. Clapper added.   Mr. Trumps demands for a congressional investigation were initially met with skepticism by lawmakers, including Republicans. Appearing on CNNs State of the Union on Sunday, Senator Marco Rubio, Republican of Florida, said he was not sure what it is that he is talking about.

Credit Khaled Abdullah/Reuters     WASHINGTON  Computers and cellphones seized during a deadly Special Operations raid in Yemen in January offer clues about attacks Al Qaeda could carry out in the future, including insights into new types of hidden explosives the group is making and new training tactics for militants, according to American officials. But it is still unclear how much the information advances the militarys knowledge of the plans and future operations of Al Qaedas branch in Yemen, although it may give a glimpse of its evolving tactics, the officials said. The Trump administration has been eager to defend itself against assertions that the raid of a Qaeda safe house , in which a member of the Navys SEAL Team 6 was killed, was a failure because little meaningful intelligence material was seized. A military investigation was also ordered to determine whether women and children died in the raid. In his address to Congress on Tuesday, President Trump called the raid highly successful and said Defense Secretary Jim Mattis had assured him that it had yielded large amounts of vital intelligence that will lead to many more victories in the future against our enemy.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   The raid is a delicate issue in the Trump administration because the president authorized it five days into office, over dinner at the White House with Mr. Mattis and several other senior officials. But in an interview with Fox & Friends on Tuesday, Mr. Trump seemed to distance himself from the operation, saying that responsibility for the decision to go forward rested with his generals. This was something that was, you know, just, they wanted to do, he said.  Continue reading the main story         Advertisement   Continue reading the main story       The information contained in the cellphones, laptop computers and other materials scooped up in the raid is still being analyzed, but it has not yet revealed any specific plots, and it has not led to any strikes against Qaeda militants in Yemen or elsewhere, officials said. American counterterrorism officials say the Qaeda wing in Yemen is one of the deadliest in the world and poses the most immediate threat to the American homeland, having tried unsuccessfully to carry out three airliner attacks over the United States. Yet analysts caution that information about the group and its plots was substantially curtailed when American advisers withdrew from Yemen in March 2015 after Houthi rebels ousted the government of President Abdu Rabbu Mansour Hadi, the United States main counterterrorism partner.  Photo        Senator John McCain said of the raids human costs, Thats not a success, in my view.   Credit Gabriella Demczuk for The New York Times    Commanders have said the potential of recovering a trove of new information about the group and its operations justified the risks to the American commandos. The death of the SEAL team member  Chief Petty Officer William Owens, known as Ryan  on Jan. 29, in the first Special Operations raid approved by Mr. Trump, came after a chain of miscues and misjudgments that plunged the elite forces into a ferocious 50-minute firefight with Qaeda militants in a mountainous village in central Yemen. Three other Americans were wounded, and a $75 million aircraft was deliberately destroyed. A month later, even as the White House and the Pentagon stoutly defend the mission , influential members of Congress are increasingly asking questions about what went wrong and why. Given the publics concerns about the raids costs and other media reports about the raid, the administration has an obligation to disclose support for this claim, said Senator Ron Wyden, an Oregon Democrat and one of half a dozen members of the Intelligence Committee interviewed for this article.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   Even supporters of the White House position say the information recovered thus far is not conclusive. I believe the material is valuable, but having said that, of course, a lot of it depends on how it plays out over time, said Senator Jim Risch, an Idaho Republican on the committee. Senator John McCain, an Arizona Republican who leads the Armed Services Committee, said in an interview that no one was disputing Chief Owenss heroism. However, he said, a Navy commando died, others were injured, and women and children were killed . Thats not a success, in my view, Mr. McCain said. The United States Central Command is conducting one investigation into the operation itself and another into the reports of civilian casualties, including the 8-year-old daughter of Anwar al-Awlaki, the American-born Qaeda leader who was killed in a targeted drone strike in 2011. Reprieve, a London-based human rights group that has interviewed residents in Yakla, the remote village where the raid occurred, said Wednesday that it had documented 23 civilian deaths in the operation, including 10 children. Chief Owenss father, Bill Owens, has been among the most vocal critics of the mission and refused to meet with Mr. Trump the day his sons body was returned to the United States. Why, at this time, did there have to be this stupid mission when it wasnt even barely a week into his administration? Mr. Owens asked in an interview published on Feb. 26 in The Miami Herald , recalling his reaction to the news of his sons death. Why?

The findings, some of which were first reported by The Associated Press, included new explosives developed by Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, or AQAP. The group has specialized in developing nonmetallic bombs that can be inserted into body cavities to avoid detection. Other new insights concern Al Qaedas regional and global network, and training techniques that give clues to attacks it could carry out in the future. Central Command has offered a more nuanced assessment of the information gained from the recovered materials than the assertions from Mr. Trump and his representatives. On Feb. 1, Sean Spicer, the White House press secretary, said the raid had gathered an unbelievable amount of intelligence that will prevent the potential deaths or attacks on American soil. Last Sunday, his deputy, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, said the mission did yield a substantial amount of very important intel and resources that helped save American lives and other lives.

Thomas, a spokesman for Central Command, responded this week to criticism about the informations significance, writing in an email: The information that was gathered is part of an ongoing effort to build our understanding of AQAP. Were not expecting to find any particular fact or puzzle piece. We were looking to build our understanding of an enemy who exports and inspires terrorist acts around the world. At the core of the Trump administrations sensitivity about the raid are two questions: Was it worth the life of a decorated member of the Navy SEALs? And, if the process of vetting the operation had been more thorough than a dinner discussion, would it have alerted the new president to the potential hazards for the American commandos and the risks of civilian casualties? According to Defense Department and administration officials, the process for approving the operation was unusual. The dinner preceded a meeting of Mr. Trumps top national security deputies at which the operation was one of several topics, and at which it was discussed with the knowledge that Mr. Trump had already approved it. The White House says that Mr. Trumps dinnertime conversation was as thorough as any that would have taken place under more formal circumstances. Eric Pelofsky, a senior official under President Barack Obama, questioned Mr. Trump and his aides approving the raid over dinner, rather than through the more deliberative process used in previous Democratic and Republican administrations. In the Obama administration, the N.S.C. process considering this operation would likely have discussed contingencies and circumstances that could damage our broader counterterrorism cooperation with the Yemeni government, Mr. Pelofsky, who was the National Security Councils senior director for North Africa and Yemen until mid-January, said Wednesday. Administration officials said Mr. Trump was highly sensitive to reports that the mission had yielded little, and there was a scramble before his speech Tuesday night to come up with a way of defending it, including having Chief Owenss widow, Carryn Owens, in the gallery. She received the most sustained applause of the entire evening, often looking to the ceiling as if she were talking with her deceased husband.

Credit Al Drago/The New York Times By  Richard W. Painter March 2, 2017 This article has been updated to reflect news developments. In the wake of Wednesdays revelation that Attorney General Jeff Sessions spoke with Russias ambassador to the United States while working with the Trump campaign, despite denying those contacts during his confirmation hearings, Mr. Sessions recused himself from overseeing any Justice Department investigation into contacts between the campaign and the Russian government. Some members of Congress are saying thats not enough; they want him to resign. Its a bombshell of a story. And its one with a clear and disturbing precedent. In 1972 Richard G. Kleindienst, the acting attorney general, appeared before the Senate Judiciary Committee in a confirmation hearing on his nomination by President Richard Nixon to be attorney general. He was to replace Attorney General John N. Mitchell, who had resigned to run Nixons re-election campaign (and who would later be sent to prison in the Watergate scandal). Several Democratic senators were concerned about rumors of White House interference in a Justice Department antitrust suit against International Telephone and Telegraph Corporation, a campaign contributor to the Republican National Committee. They asked Kleindienst several times if he had ever spoken with anyone at the White House about the I.T.T. case. He said he had not. That wasnt true. Later, after Kleindienst was confirmed as attorney general, the special prosecutor, Leon Jaworski, and his team uncovered an Oval Office tape recording of a phone call in which Nixon told Kleindiesnt to drop the I.T.T. case. Kleindienst claimed that he thought the senators questions were limited to a particular period, not the entire time during which the case was pending. Jaworski didnt buy it. He filed criminal charges against Kleindienst, who had earlier resigned as attorney general. Eventually Kleindienst pleaded guilty to failure to provide accurate information to Congress, a misdemeanor, for conduct that many observers believed amounted to perjury. He was also reprimanded by the Arizona State Bar. Last month, during Mr. Sessionss confirmation hearing for attorney general, Senator Al Franken, Democrat from Minnesota, asked Mr. Sessions what he would do if he learned of evidence that anyone affiliated with the Trump campaign communicated with the Russian government in the course of the 2016 campaign. Im not aware of any of those activities, Mr. Sessions answered , adding, I have been called a surrogate at a time or two in that campaign, and I did not have communications with the Russians. Mr. Sessions also, on his written Senate confirmation questionnaire, denied having had any communications about the 2016 election with the Russians. We now know that Mr. Sessions had at least two conversations with the Russian ambassador to the United States in July and September 2016 while Mr. Sessions was an adviser to the Trump campaign. Once again, we see an attorney general trying to explain away misleading testimony in his own confirmation hearing. A spokeswoman for Mr. Sessions says that there was absolutely nothing misleading about his answer because he did not communicate with the ambassador in his capacity as a Trump campaign surrogate. His contacts with the Russian ambassador, he claims, were made in his capacity as a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee. That may or may not have been the case (individual senators ordinarily do not discuss committee business with ambassadors of other countries, particularly our adversaries). Regardless, Mr. Sessions did not truthfully and completely testify. If he had intended to say that his contacts with the Russians had been in his capacity as a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee and not for the Trump campaign, he could have said that. He then would have been open to the very relevant line of questioning about what those contacts were, and why he was unilaterally talking with the ambassador of a country that was a longstanding adversary of the United States. He did not reveal the communications at all, however. He did so knowing that Senator Franken was asking about communications with the Russians by anyone working for the Trump campaign, including people who, like Mr. Sessions, had other jobs while they volunteered for the Trump campaign. Mr. Sessionss answer was at best a failure to provide accurate information to Congress, the same conduct that cost Attorney General Kleindienst his job. And this time, unlike in 1972, the attorney generals misleading testimony involves communications not with the president of the United States, but with a rival nuclear superpower. In 1972, any federal employee who provided such inaccurate information under oath about communications with the Russians would have been fired and had his or her security clearances revoked immediately, and probably also would have been criminally prosecuted. The Cold War may be over, but Russia in the past few years has once again sought to destabilize the democratic process not only in the United States, but also in much of Europe. Russian support for Communist parties is gone, but Russian support for far right and nationalist movements globally is on the rise, as is Russian spying. President Trump has already fired his national security adviser, Michael Flynn, for misleading Vice President Pence about his conversations with the Russians. Misleading the United States Senate in testimony under oath is at least as serious. We do not yet know all the facts, but we know enough to see that Attorney General Sessions has to go as well. Correction :  An earlier version of this essay misstated the circumstances of John N. Mitchells resignation as attorney general in 1972. Mitchell left to run the Nixon re-election operation; he did not resign in disgrace (his role in the Watergate scandal came to light later). Richard W. Painter, a professor at the University of Minnesota Law School, was the chief White House ethics lawyer from 2005 to 2007.

A report by IOActive cited security flaws in some of these kind of robots.   Credit Franck Robichon/European Pressphoto Agency     SAN FRANCISCO  In the coming age of robotics, many of those autonomous machines will be internet-connected and mobile. What could possibly go wrong? Significant security flaws were found in an examination of six home and industrial robots, according to a report to be released Wednesday by IOActive, a computer security consulting firm with headquarters in Seattle. The report notes that only four of the six companies responded to the firms alert, and only two said they planned to make patches after being informed of the problems. The researchers, who described the categories of vulnerabilities they had discovered in the report but not the specific flaws, said their research was simply an early reconnaissance of the field. Its important to note that our testing was not even a deep, extensive security audit, as that would have taken a much larger investment of time and resources, the authors wrote. The goal for this work was to gain a high-level sense of how insecure todays robots are, which we accomplished.

Continue reading the main story         Advertisement   Continue reading the main story       The desire for online commerce brought strong cryptographic algorithms into our daily lives, said Joe Britt, the chief executive of Afero, a Los Altos, Calif.-based maker of secure communications systems for the world of so-called embedded computing. As embedded systems for sensors and robotics flourish in the next wave of computing, failure to apply these proven safeguards is like leaving the locks off of our doors. The research underscores the potential security challenges that await the world of mobile robots. Given the popularity of stationary home robotic systems like Amazons Echo and Googles Home personal assistants as well as dozens of other internet-connected devices like doorbells, video cameras and even light bulbs, it appears that consumers are willing to trust that manufacturers are building adequate security into the products. It is common for manufacturers that do not have good security practices to not know how to deal with vulnerability reports. Most of them probably do not have a procedure in place to handle reports and neither to provide security fixes to customers. Robots are widely used in manufacturing. But they are largely systems like robot arms that do not have autonomous functions and cannot move around in the environment.  Photo        Rethink Robotics says that vulnerabilities have been phased out of models like the Baxter, above.   Credit Sally Ryan for The New York Times    There is a growing consensus that during the next decade, advances in artificial intelligence will make it possible for robots to move freely in unstructured environments. This will bring self-driving cars closer to reality and will also lead to a generation of machines that will operate autonomously in homes, offices and factories. The authors of the new report challenged the robotics industry, saying that not enough attention was being given to well-known security issues that have proved devastating for existing commercial computer networks. We call it an internet-of-things with arms and legs and wheels, said Cesar Cerrudo, chief technology officer of IOActive. The surface of attack is huge. Each robot has multiple ways it can be compromised.  Newsletter Sign Up  Continue reading the main story        Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.  Invalid email address.

They forget about important issues. Robots can have microphones and cameras; they can walk and they can grab objects. People dont realize the consequences of something that can grab an object or can hear or see you. The report identifies security flaws in a number of robots, including NAO and Pepper home robots made by SoftBank Robotics; and manufacturing robots from Universal Robots and Rethink Robotics, two makers of robot arms that are intended to collaborate with human workers in assembly line applications. It also identifies flaws in small humanoid robots made by UBTECH Robotics and Robotis, and in robotics software developed by Asratec Corp. The report identifies seven different kinds of security issues, ranging from weak cryptographic systems and vulnerable default configurations to what security experts call authentication issues. In some cases, they noted that it was possible to control some robot functions without authentication. We found key robot services that didnt require a username and password, allowing anyone to remotely access those services, the report said. One of the robot manufacturers identified by the report disputed the findings. Two of the criticisms leveled by the researchers actually involved features added for research and education markets, according to Gil Haylon, a Rethink Robotics spokesman. He added that other vulnerabilities had been phased out in the latest software release for the companys Baxter and Sawyer robots, which are intended for light assembly operations. Universal Robots said it was looking into the issue raised by the researchers. The other companies did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

Outrage provides necessary motivation. But only strategy can deliver victory. The emotional response to the rightist populism sweeping the West is one of protest and dismay. But if there is to be an effective fightback, there has to be a cool analysis of what is happening, why and what can be done. Politics is being reshaped, and this phenomenon is the same whether it is in the United States or in Europe. At stake in the forthcoming elections in France and Germany will be the future of Europe and, possibly, of European liberal democracy. The rightist populism, on both sides of the Atlantic, is intent on blowing up traditional conservative politics and replacing it with a new coalition, comprising traditionally left-leaning supporters in working-class communities who feel left behind by globalization and traditionally right-leaning supporters who hate liberalism. Both constituencies believe that traditional culture is at risk from immigration and political correctness. Both believe in the nation-state as opposed to international alliances. Both feel let down by the so-called elites and think that the solution is an authoritarian figure strong enough not to care what a biased establishment thinks about him. This is a revolution that is partly economic, but mainly cultural. The new coalition differs from the old Reagan-Thatcher one, though it has some similarities. Back in the 1980s, working-class voters moved to the right because they felt that the left didnt satisfy their aspirations for self-improvement. That was a cultural issue, of course; but it was primarily an economic one. It was not so much that they felt fearful as that they felt held back. Today is different. The modus operandi of this populism is not to reason but to roar. It has at times an anarchic feel. Yet it has also mobilized a powerful media behind it. Its supporters welcome the outrage their leaders provoke. This polarizes public discourse and enhances their sense of belonging, so that even when theyre in government, they act as if they were excluded from it. Meanwhile, traditional conservatives feel like strangers in their own land. They are unsure whether to play along with the new order on the basis that it will soon pass or to accept that this is a revolution aimed at overturning their authority and fight it. The causes of this movement are the scale, scope and speed of change. This is occurring economically as jobs are displaced and communities fractured, and culturally as the force of globalization moves the rest of the world closer and blurs old boundaries of nation, race and culture. The same dynamics are splintering the left, too. One element has aligned with the right in revolt against globalization, but with business taking the place of migrants as the chief evil. They agree with the right-wing populists about elites, though for the left the elites are the wealthy, while for the right theyre the liberals. This leftist populism is a profound error. It has no chance of matching the populist appeal of the right, and it dangerously validates some of the rights arguments. This only fuels a cynicism that depresses support for the more progressive parts of the lefts program. But this left tendency has gained from the seeming paralysis of the center. The parties and politicians of the center have become the managers of the status quo in an era when people want change. So, the center  in both its center-right and center-left camps  is marginalized, even despised. The question is, will this be a temporary phase, perhaps linked to the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis and Sept. 11, and will politics soon revert to normal, or has a new political age begun? The party structures on both sides of the Atlantic have their origins in the Industrial Revolution and the debates engendered by that epoch about socialism and capitalism, the market and the state. These parties have endured because the roots they put down were very strong. But now, there are different distinctions than those simply of traditional right and left. When I was growing up, people like my dad were conservative; and that meant economically and socially. Today, many such voters dont fit that old stereotype. They may be pro-private enterprise and conservative on economics in traditional terms, but theyre also socially liberal  in favor, for instance, of gay rights. And there are those who used to vote left, but who are culturally illiberal and now dont mind voting for parties of the wealthy. Today, a distinction that often matters more than traditional right and left is open vs. closed. The open-minded see globalization as an opportunity but one with challenges that should be mitigated; the closed-minded see the outside world as a threat. This distinction crosses traditional party lines and thus has no organizing base, no natural channel for representation in electoral politics. Politics in most European countries, and certainly in the United States, is still dominated by the traditional parties of right and left. Under pressure from radical populism, though, its shifting more to the extremes, as were seeing with the British Labour Party and the French Socialists. So this leaves a big space in the center. For the progressive wing of politics, the correct strategy is to make the case for building a new coalition out from the center. To do so, progressives need to acknowledge the genuine cultural anxieties of those voters who have deserted the cause of social progress: on immigration, the threat of radical Islamism and the difference between being progressive and appearing obsessive on issues like gender identity. The center needs to develop a new policy agenda that shows people they will get support to help them through the change thats happening around them. At the heart of this has to be an alliance between those driving the technological revolution, in Silicon Valley and elsewhere, and those responsible for public policy in government. At present, there is a chasm of understanding between the two. There will inevitably continue to be a negative impact on jobs from artificial intelligence and big data, but the opportunities to change lives for the better through technology are enormous. Any new agenda has to focus on these opportunities for radical change in the way that government and services like health care serve people. This must include how we educate, skill and equip our work forces for the future; how we reform tax and welfare systems to encourage more fair distribution of wealth; and how we replenish our nations infrastructures and invest in the communities most harmed by trade and technology. Progressives must reach across the party divide, making a virtue of nonpartisanship. Those who feel dispossessed within existing party structures should make common cause, and do so unashamedly. This is exactly what those of us are doing in Britain who are making the case for staying in a reformed European Union. The politics of the progressive center has not died, but it needs reinventing and re-energizing. For liberal democracy to survive and thrive, we must build a new coalition that is popular, not populist. Tony Blair, a former leader of the Labour Party, was prime minister of Britain from 1997 to 2007.

Or that it is not clear if the Pentagon, which views Russia as the biggest threat, and the new president, who is mainly focused on defeating the Islamic State, agree on the priorities. The services are betting that Mr. Trump will eventually win a large enough chunk of the money so that they can do a bit of everything, like reversing recent declines in the number of soldiers and Marines and breaking logjams over how many high-tech jets and ships they can afford to build. But there are no guarantees, and the battle over next years federal budget will be ferocious. Democrats have vowed to block the presidents proposal to strip the $54 billion from domestic programs and shift it to the military. Nearly everyone expects the fight to drag on for months.

Speaking in the hangar bay of the nuclear-powered aircraft carrier Gerald R. Ford, which this year will become the nations largest and most powerful floating fortress, Mr. Trump said the Navy  and other military services  must grow and modernize. The 100,000-ton vessel, the first of a new, more technologically advanced carrier class, cost about $13 billion after cost overruns and years of delay.

The same boat for less money, the same ship for less money, the same airplanes for less money. Mr. Trump has complained about the cost estimates for new Air Force One planes to be built by Boeing, and he has pressed executives at Lockheed Martin to lower the cost of the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter . Whether that personal negotiating strategy can be applied across the breadth of the militarys shopping is untested. The presidents aides have told the services to turn in their wish lists by March 16, and Defense Department and White House officials will plug in the final breakdown before submitting a budget to Congress, probably in May. In a speech last September, Mr. Trump complained that President Barack Obama had cut the number of soldiers and Marines too sharply as the Pentagon shifted to special operations troops and armed drones to hunt terrorists. He also lamented that the Navy had fewer than half the ships it had under President Reagan. He said then that the Army should hire 50,000 soldiers to get back to 540,000, and he supports a Navy plan to increase its fleet to 355 ships from 276. That plan calls for the Navy to buy more destroyers and start building three nuclear-powered attack submarines a year instead of two. But Mr. Trump has also called for a more isolationist foreign policy and has said that American allies should pick up more of the bill for defending themselves. And even central tenets of military strategy are in question. At the same time Mr. Trump has been criticized by lawmakers from both parties for cozying up to Russia, his defense secretary, James Mattis, a retired Marine general, has described that country as Americas principal threat . As a result, independent analysts said, it is hard to square the presidents foreign and defense policies or know what his final priorities would be if Congress only approved part of the money he is seeking.

That is something that the Trump administration has not really rationalized yet. Mr. Obama approved a series of sophisticated new weapons projects, including a new long-range bomber for the Air Force and massive ballistic missile submarines for the Navy. So the debate within the Pentagon now is not so much about pitting the services against one another to see whose pet project will survive as it is about determining how much money is needed to keep all the big projects going. The Air Force, for instance, has been trying to expand production of the F-35 while also building new aerial-refueling tankers, modernizing nuclear missile systems and building the new stealth bombers. Mr. Obamas last budget plan had forecast a $35 billion increase in Pentagon spending in the 2018 fiscal year to pay for all these programs. Mr. Trumps proposal, which would increase the defense budget to $603 billion, is $19 billion, or about 3 percent, higher than Mr. Obamas. Other Republicans, such as Senator John McCain of Arizona, the chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, contend that even more is needed to maintain a technological edge over Russia and China. He recently released a report calling for a broader high/low mix in weapons capabilities and greater spending on research into space, cyber and artificial intelligence technologies. But analysts say that the ultimate figure will be decided less by the Pentagons support for particular programs than in overall budget negotiations between Congress and Mr. Trump, who is trying to change the kind of deals that have been struck since a deficit-reduction law required cuts in federal spending. Under the law, the Budget Control Act of 2011, the cuts had to be divided evenly between defense and nondefense programs. Mr. Obama and Congress agreed several times after that on annual budgets that exceeded the caps and split the increases 50-50 between defense and domestic programs. But Mr. Trumps proposal on Monday to increase military spending by $54 billion and cut nonmilitary programs by the same amount would shatter that truce. It also would require changes in the budget law, and that would give Senate Democrats, who want to protect domestic programs, leverage to force Mr. Trump to compromise. They could filibuster any bill attempting to change that 50-50 split, and the Republicans would have difficulty assembling the 60 votes needed to stop the filibuster.

Gordon Adams, who oversaw military budgets in the Clinton White House, said that while Mr. Trump would not get as much as he was asking for, he might still be able to tilt the spending balance toward the military. In the end, I think the budget caps will be adjusted upward again, he said, and we might get an uneven deal where the caps are higher for defense than for the domestic programs.   Michael D.
